  <h2>Chapter 3: In a new light</h2>  
  <h3>So GameChat is made up of many different technologies, but were there any challenges or conflicts while co-ordinating those technologies?</h3> <p><strong>Ono:</strong><br>We mentioned earlier how <strong><a href="/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/GameChat/Nintendo-Switch-2-GameChat-2785625.html" class="" title="Nintendo Switch 2 &#8211; GameChat">GameChat</a></strong> can be made to resemble a gaming livestream, but at the same time, it&#8217;s not a live-streaming tool, so we consciously avoided giving that impression. The main purpose of GameChat is to communicate via speech. It also supports features like screen sharing, and video chat when using a camera, so we hope people will enjoy trying out GameChat with friends.</p>  
  <h3>So it's possible to make it resemble a gaming livestream if that's what you really want, but ultimately it&#8217;s a communication feature.</h3> <p><strong>Ono:</strong><br>To avoid confusion, we went through a lot of trial and error, especially when it came to the layout for sharing game screens. For example, there&#8217;s a feature where you can expand and view the game screen of another player. When you do that, only the game screen is expanded, and not the camera image of the player themselves. If a player expands a game screen, then that must be the thing they want to see more clearly. So, we wanted players to be able to look at that screen while hanging out with close friends using voice chat and so on.</p>  
  <h3>You mentioned a "student lounge".</h3> <p><strong>Ono:</strong><br>We envisioned a place where close friends could gather. Everyone is sharing a space, but one person might be looking at their smartphone, while another is playing a game and someone else is reading a comic. So, everyone&#8217;s doing their own thing, but it still feels comfortable being together. It's the same thing with GameChat. Everyone can be playing the same game together, or each be playing a different game while they enjoy hanging out. That's the kind of care-free and comfortable space we're hoping to achieve.</p><p><strong>Tokunaga:</strong><br>With GameChat, I think conversations between friends will change from &#8220;Let&#8217;s play Mario Kart at 3 o'clock&#8221; to &#8220;I&#8217;ll send you a GameChat invite &#8211; come join&#8221;. For example, with past Nintendo consoles, I don't think it was as easy to arrange an online play session without deciding in advance what game to play and when. But, with the introduction of GameChat, friends can just start gathering together, even if they don't arrange the game and time in advance. While they each do their own thing, they can discuss what to play next or check out what their friends are playing, and so on. I think this is a big change.</p>  
  <h3>I see, now I understand what you mean by &#8220;student lounge&#8221;. It's a place where you can hang out even if you don't have anything special planned.</h3> <p><strong>Ono:</strong><br>Also, while testing out game screen sharing, we realised it's also effective at filling the gaps in conversation.</p>  
  <h3>How do you mean?</h3> <p><strong>Ono:</strong><br>With voice chat, people tend to feel like they have to keep talking, but by sharing your game screen, it's like you&#8217;re communicating without speaking, so you can stay in that space without it becoming awkward. And then a conversation might start from another player's game screen that happens to catch your attention.</p><p><strong>Tamura:</strong><br>Even just looking at someone else&#8217;s game screen can spark a conversation, like, &#8220;What game is that?&#8221; or &#8220;How did you do that?&#8221;. At which point, everyone might put down their controllers and focus on one player's screen. You can show others how to play by gesturing to the camera with your controller and saying &#8220;Use this button&#8221;, and so on, so I think it creates new ways to enjoy games that you've been playing alone.</p><p><strong>Ono:</strong><br>Speaking of new ways to have fun, we made a new discovery when we were playing Stardew Valley (12) online with everyone using GameChat. When everyone is assigned a role and starts collecting their materials, it&#8217;s easy to lose track of where everyone is, but when you&#8217;re sharing your game screens with GameChat, you know at a glance what other players are doing. You can have exchanges like, &#8220;Ah, I see you struggling in that cave. I&#8217;m coming to help you!&#8221;. If information can be shared more easily between players, it gives you more ways to play the game. This was something we learned over the course of development.</p>  
 
  <p><strong>Tokunaga:</strong><br>The same goes for Animal Crossing: New Horizons (13). You can go visit your friend&#8217;s island when you&#8217;re playing online, but even if you&#8217;re busy on your own island, if you can see your chat partner's game screen, you can say, for example, &#8220;Hey, Redd's on your island! Let me come over and shop&#8221;. It felt like my field of vision had suddenly expanded beyond my own personal game world, which I thought was a great experience.</p><p><strong>Ono:</strong><br>We found that games with a time limit can also become even more fun with GameChat. Part Time UFO (14) doesn&#8217;t have an online competitive mode, but for example, two people playing locally could connect to two other players via GameChat and share their game screen, letting them compete for scores as if they were playing two versus two. When you glance at the other team's game screen, you can see how much time they have left, and realise, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re winning!&#8221;, or you might get tips on how to win, so it felt like we'd created a new kind of gameplay.</p>   
  <h3>It seems like even single-player titles like Ring Fit Adventure (15) can be turned into a competition if you use GameChat.</h3> <p><strong>Ono:</strong><br>With game screen sharing it's possible to compete against other players, but since the Nintendo Switch 2 camera has a wide-angle view, it might be more fun to see each other moving while playing the game, rather than just the game screen. Plus, if you're playing with other people, it feels like you're in it together, which might help you overcome exercises that you would have struggled to do on your own.</p>  
  <h3>I see. It's a way to enjoy the game that wouldn't exist without the camera. By the way, I heard that Switch 2 will have a feature called CameraPlay, which brings the camera into the gameplay.</h3> <p><strong>Ono:</strong><br>With CameraPlay, the camera feed is displayed on-screen as you play. For example, with Super Mario Party Jamboree &#8211; Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV (16), which is compatible with CameraPlay, your face is captured by the camera and displayed next to the character you&#8217;re playing. In party games, it can sometimes be difficult to keep track of who&#8217;s using which character, but when you get first place in a minigame, a crown is placed above your face, and if you lose, an effect like &#8220;Oh no!&#8221; appears, so it&#8217;s fun to watch all of that unfold on-screen.</p>

  <p><strong>Ono:</strong><br>CameraPlay can be used both offline and while using GameChat online. By combining it with GameChat, CameraPlay can be enjoyed with friends far away.</p><p><strong>Tamura:</strong><br>You don't usually get to see your own facial expressions when playing a game, but it's refreshing to see them displayed on the game screen alongside everyone else's.</p>  
  <h3>That sounds like fun. But since faces and expressions will be clearly visible on-screen, I'm curious about the overall safety. What kind of controls will be in place to ensure it's safe to use?</h3> <p><strong>Ono:</strong><br>We thought a lot about how we could make GameChat safe and secure for players. First of all, you won't be able to use GameChat with everyone on your friend list by default. We assume some players will have somebody on their friend list who they've only played online with once, and yet somehow they ended up accepting their friend request. Given that possibility, players might feel uncomfortable if suddenly everyone on their friend list can invite them to a video chat. With that in mind, during the initial setup, you can choose the friends you want to be able to chat with from your friend list before you start using GameChat. So if you join a room created by a friend, it'll only include people you or your friend have approved for GameChat. Even if a friend of a friend is in the room, you'll see that before joining, so you won't end up chatting with people you don't want to.</p>  
  <h3>Right. But in the case of children, you need to be even more careful, don't you?</h3> <p><strong>Ono:</strong><br>There was a lot of internal discussion about this, and we decided that children under 16 can only use GameChat with people on their friend list whom their parent or guardian has given permission to chat with via the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls app. In the case of voice chat, once a parent gives their child approval to chat with a particular person, their child will always be able to connect with the approved person from then on. But we're even more cautious when it comes to video chat. When a child tries to start or join a video chat on their Switch 2, a request is sent to the parent&#8217;s app. The request must be approved before the video chat can begin. While children may feel a bit restricted, we decided to prioritise safety and require parents to approve the request every time.</p><p><strong>Tamura:</strong><br>The camera is also equipped with a privacy shutter that allows the lens to be shut when not in use, and you can see at a glance whether the camera is on or off.</p><p><strong>Ono:</strong><br>We want everyone to feel comfortable using this feature, so we've placed a high priority on safety to avoid any unpleasant experiences. Of course, we want all players to follow the <strong><a href="/en-gb/Legal-information/NOE-COMMUNITY-GUIDELINES-1938606.html" class="" title="NOE COMMUNITY GUIDELINES">Community Guidelines</a></strong>, even when chatting with friends.</p>  
  <h3>Thank you very much. It's clear you've put a lot of effort into creating a chat feature that anyone can use comfortably and safely. Last but not least, could you each give a message to the players who'll be using GameChat?</h3> <p><strong>Tamura:</strong><br>I&#8217;d like everyone to first have fun trying it out with close friends. When Nintendo Switch 2 is released, I'd like to invite my friends who live far away and who I don't often get to see to join me on GameChat and play together using the Nintendo Switch 2 camera. I hope a lot of people will get to experience it.</p><p><strong>Tokunaga:</strong><br>When I played existing games with GameChat, I felt like I was able to see them from a new perspective. I don't know if everyone will experience the same feeling, but whatever game it is, please just ask a friend to join you and give it a try. You can quietly focus on the game, or chat while you play. There are lots of ways to enjoy it, so I&#8217;d be more than happy if GameChat becomes a part of players' gaming lives.</p><p><strong>Ono:</strong><br>GameChat is packed with many features, including voice chat, video chat, and the ability to share game screens, but we've developed it so that players can use it without too much effort. So, even if you're a first-timer, have reservations about voice chat, or don't like difficult features, please give it a try. We developed it so that players would instinctively get how to use it just by playing around. Also, depending on how you use GameChat, you might see games you've played previously in a new light. Even as developers, we definitely haven't discovered all the ways that GameChat can be used with existing games. I hope players will discover lots more new and interesting ways to play with it.</p>  
  <h3>I look forward to seeing how GameChat expands how we play both new and existing games on Nintendo Switch 2. Thank you very much.</h3>
