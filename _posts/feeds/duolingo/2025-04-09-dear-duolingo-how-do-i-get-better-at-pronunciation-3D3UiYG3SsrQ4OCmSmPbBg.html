                <p>Welcome to another week of Dear Duolingo, an advice column just for language learners. Catch up on past installments <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/tag/dear-duolingo/">here</a>.</p><p>Hello, learners! This week&#8217;s topic is a fun one, because it opens the door to the exciting world of sounds in your new language. Let&#8217;s dive in:</p><p><strong>The question is:</strong></p><p>Ah, Hear Me Out: you&#8217;re not alone! Learning to <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/why-are-some-accents-easier-than-others/#accents-in-our-brains">identify and pronounce sounds</a> in a new language is really hard&#8212;and there are good reasons why. Even before we understand words in our first language, our brains are already hard at work <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/how-your-brain-finds-patterns/#statistical-learning-in-your-own-language">detecting sound patterns</a> and figuring out how to produce them. So when you&#8217;re learning a second language as an adult, you&#8217;re not just picking up new vocabulary&#8212;you&#8217;re also <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/why-is-pronunciation-hard/#bringing-old-sounds-to-a-new-language">retraining your brain and your mouth</a> to produce sounds they&#8217;ve probably never had to make before!&#160;</p><p>No matter what spoken language you're studying, some sounds will be easier for you to make than others. Don&#8217;t get too hung up on those difficult sounds&#8212;there are probably other aspects of pronunciation that you've already gotten the hang of. This week, we'll share some pronunciation tips for all learners, but keep an eye out for language-specific tips in the future!</p><h2 id="%F0%9F%91%82listen-more">&#128066;Listen more</h2><p>The first step in being able to make new sounds is to <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/why-do-some-words-sound-the-same/#6-%E2%80%A6they-arent-pronounced-the-same-%F0%9F%98%B1">learn to hear those sounds</a> and distinguish them from others. At first, this can be tricky so you&#8217;ll need lots and lots of listening practice to help train your ear, and, indirectly, your mouth! Listening to <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/why-is-it-hard-to-understand-movies-in-another-language/">natural, casual language like on TV</a> or podcasts can be especially helpful, but any listening practice will get you learning. For example, you can tune in to news or sports broadcasts, and <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/how-music-can-help-you-learn-a-language/">use music</a> to get used to the rhythm of the language, its words, and the specific pronunciations of consonants and vowels. (Fun fact: This helped <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/how-juanes-learned-english/">Colombian musician Juanes</a> learn English!)</p><h2 id="%F0%9F%90%A2-speak-slower">&#128034; Speak slower&#160;</h2><p>Give yourself permission to sound different in your new language, including by speaking slower. It&#8217;s easy to feel tongue-tied, and slowing down can give you a bit more time to formulate what you want to say, and get your tongue ready for the next word (or sound!). This is especially good advice for intermediate and advanced learners, who may know the words to say but still feel tripped up by the sounds!</p><h2 id="%F0%9F%8E%AF-focus-on-what-gets-you-understood">&#127919; Focus on what gets you understood&#160;</h2>
 
<p>Some kinds of sounds matter more for comprehension than others! Sounds range from "This will help avoid misunderstanding" all the way down to "This may not be how native speakers pronounce it, but it's not getting in the way." For example, if you&#8217;re learning Spanish, saying beso (kiss) instead of peso (weight) could cause some serious confusion. That&#8217;s because the &#8220;b&#8221; and &#8220;p&#8221; sounds carry different meanings in Spanish&#8212;just like in English!</p>
 
 
 
<p>On the other hand, if you pronounce the &#8220;d&#8221; in Spanish cada (each) as you would the &#8220;d&#8221; in English Denver&#8212;instead of using the Spanish pronunciation (which is like &#8220;th&#8221; in English mother)&#8212;it might sound a little off to native speakers, but it won&#8217;t interfere with communication.</p>
 
<p>Prioritize practicing the sounds that matter for meaning, like &#8220;b&#8221; vs. &#8220;p&#8221;! You don't need to sound like you've used the language your whole life <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/4-language-mistakes-i-made-in-italy-and-why-they-didnt-matter/">to be easily understood</a> and be confident using the language. For intermediate and advanced learners, changing the rhythm and melody of how you talk can improve how well you're understood more than fine-tuning exact sounds.</p><h2 id="%F0%9F%93%96-read-aloud">&#128214; Read aloud&#160;</h2><p>Reading out loud is a low-pressure way to get used to producing the sounds and words in the language. Plus, you don't actually have to focus on understanding or creating the ideas yourself. This is a great way to get comfortable speaking! You can do this during your daily lessons&#8212;even if it&#8217;s not a speaking exercise, you can repeat after the character, or read your sentence aloud after typing.</p><h2 id="%F0%9F%8E%99%EF%B8%8F-record-yourself">&#127897;&#65039; Record yourself</h2><p>Recording yourself is one of the most powerful tools for improving pronunciation (<a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/language-tips-from-a-hyperpolyglot/#tip-3-record-yourself">and more!</a>) in a new language. It lets you actually hear how you sound, helping you catch patterns you might otherwise miss. But keep in mind you won&#8217;t always be the best judge of your own pronunciation! Asking a trusted native speaker (or advanced learner) to listen and point out one key sound to focus on at a time can make your practice more targeted and effective.</p><h2 id="%F0%9F%8C%B1-accept-your-mistakes-as-part-of-the-process">&#127793; Accept your mistakes as part of the process&#160;</h2><p>You have been speaking your first language since you started babbling as a baby, so you're retraining muscles that have been moving in one particular way for many years! It's <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/common-mistakes-language-learners/">normal to make mistakes</a> in your new language, so you should <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/5-mistakes-professional-language-learner-still-makes/">expect and even welcome</a> those moments of trial and error!&#160;</p><h2 id="%F0%9F%98%85-sounds-easy-right">&#128517; Sounds easy, right?</h2><p>No matter what language you're studying, remember to focus on communication and being understood! Pronunciation will be a part of that, but you don't need to get every sound exactly the way you want to be successful and clear. As you progress in your language learning, you'll gradually pick up many pronunciation nuances, so stick with it and keep listening and reading to help your speaking!</p>
