title: 'Verlan: the amazing system of French slang'
---
<div>
                
 
<p>Verlan is your golden ticket to French slang: It's a whole system of slang where syllables (or just sounds!) in a word are swapped to create a new, often playful, term. The word <i>verlan</i> itself was created by swapping the syllables of l&#8217;envers, which means "the reverse"&#8212;so the syllables in <i>l&#8217;en-vers</i> switch places and become <i>ver-lan</i>.&#160;</p>
 
<p>Here are five common syllable-flipping verlan words you might hear in France!</p><h2 id="1-femme-woman-%E2%86%92-meuf"><strong>1. femme (woman) &#8594; meuf</strong></h2>
 
<p>When someone says the word meuf, they're using the <i>verlan</i> version of femme&#8212;a word that means "woman" or, in some contexts, "girlfriend."</p>
 

 

  
    <span class="soundcite pcontent">C&#8217;est qui c&#8217;te meuf ?</span>
    Who's that woman?
  
  
    <span class="soundcite pcontent">Elle est o&#249; ta meuf ?</span>
    Where's your girlfriend?
  

 
<p>&#128161; Pro tip: While meuf can be used informally among friends, it&#8217;s best to gauge the familiarity and context of a situation before using this word to avoid sounding overly casual or even disrespectful.</p><h2 id="2-lourd-annoying-%E2%86%92-relou">2. lourd (annoying) &#8594; relou</h2>
 
<p>If you hear someone describing a person or situation as relou, they're using the <i>verlan</i> form of lourd to mean "annoying."</p>
 

 

  
    <span class="soundcite pcontent">Elle est trop relou c'te meuf !</span>
    That woman is so annoying!
  
  
    <span class="soundcite pcontent">C'est un gros relou !</span>
    He's so annoying!
  
  
    <span class="soundcite pcontent">C'est relou qu'ils soient pas venus !</span>
    It sucks that they didn't come.
  

 

 
<p>&#128161; For extra emphasis, you can say trop relou to describe something or someone that's very annoying. (In casual, spoken French, you can use <i>trop</i> to modify any adjective.)&#160;</p>
 
<h2 id="3-bizarre-strange-%E2%86%92-zarbi">3. bizarre (strange) &#8594; zarbi</h2>
 
<p>When someone says something is zarbi, they are using the <i>verlan</i> form of bizarre meaning &#8220;strange, unusual.&#8221;</p>
 

 

  
    <span class="soundcite pcontent">Moi j&#8217;le trouve zarbi.</span>
    I think he's weird.
  
  
    <span class="soundcite pcontent">Avoue qu&#8217;c&#8217;est zarbi quand m&#234;me.</span>
    You've gotta admit it's weird.
  

 

 
<p>&#128161; You might also hear zarbe, which is short for <i>zarbi</i>.</p>
 
<h2 id="4-louche-suspicious-%E2%86%92-chelou">4. louche (suspicious) &#8594; chelou</h2>
 
<p>If a person is chelou (which is <i>verlan</i> for louche), it means they&#8217;re shady or suspicious. You can also use <i>chelou</i> to describe things or situations.</p>
 

 

  
    <span class="soundcite pcontent">Comme il est chelou !</span>
    He's so shady!
  
  
    <span class="soundcite pcontent">C'est vraiment chelou c&#8217;t&#8217; histoire.</span>
    That story is really shady.
  

 
<h2 id="5-fou-crazy-%E2%86%92-ouf">5. fou (crazy) &#8594; ouf</h2>
 
<p>When you hear someone calling another person ouf, they're using the <i>verlan</i> form of fou to describe someone as crazy or wild.</p>
 

 

  
    <span class="soundcite pcontent">T'es un vrai ouf, toi !</span>
    You're nuts!
  

 

 
<p>To express agreement, you can say de ouf which means "totally" or "for real."</p>
 

 

  
    <span class="soundcite pcontent">Comme il a chang&#233; !</span><br><span class="soundcite pcontent">-Mais de ouf !</span>
    He's changed so much!<br>-Totally!
  

 
<h2 id="le-verlan-c%E2%80%99est-trop-ouf">Le verlan, c&#8217;est trop ouf !</h2><p>Verlan is a playful and dynamic aspect of the French language that keeps it interesting and lively. Next time you hear a French speaker using one of these words either in real life or in a movie, podcast, song, etc., you'll know exactly what it means! &#127881;</p>
