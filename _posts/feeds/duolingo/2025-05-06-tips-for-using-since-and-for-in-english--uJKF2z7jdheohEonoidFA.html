title: Tips for using “since” and “for” in English

<div>
                <p>Do you confuse the words since and for? Some languages only have one word that means both, so it's common for learners to mix them up!</p><p>Since and for are <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/prepositions-across-languages/">prepositions</a> that combine with other words to tell us something about the verb. They also both refer to the past, but in different ways.</p><p>Here's everything you need to know to use since and for in English!</p><h3 id="in-this-post">In this post:</h3><p><a href="#when-to-use-since" rel="noreferrer">When to use since</a><br><a href="#when-to-use-for" rel="noreferrer">When to use for</a><br><a href="#tips-for-deciding-between-since-and-for" rel="noreferrer">Tips for deciding between since and for</a></p><h2 id="when-to-use-since">When to use since</h2><p>Since refers to &#8220;since <strong>when</strong>?&#8221; and is followed by some amount of time, including dates, days, and times of day. (Since can also be a conjunction, but here we're focusing on how to use it as a preposition.)&#160;</p><p>Since is used when referring to a specific time in the past that you can pinpoint, and it implies that the action started back then and continues until now.</p>
 

  
    Example
    What else we know
    Why <i>since</i>
  
  
    I&#8217;ve lived here <b>since</b> 2019.
    The speaker still lives here now.
    2019 is a specific year or date, and the action of living there continues until now.
  
  
    I&#8217;ve been in Pittsburgh <b>since</b> Tuesday.
    The speaker is still in Pittsburgh.
    &#8220;Tuesday&#8221; is a specific day, and the action of being in Pittsburgh continues until now.
  
  
    I&#8217;ve lived in England <b>since</b> I was a child.
    The speaker still lives in England.
    Even a long period of time (like childhood) can be considered specific, and here, the speaker continues living in England.
  
  
    I&#8217;ve been waiting here <b>since</b> 3 o&#8217;clock. 
    The speaker is still waiting.
    Three o&#8217;clock is a specific time, and the action of waiting continues until now.
  

 
<h3 id="verb-form-used-with-since">Verb form used with since</h3><p>Did you notice anything else in common with these examples? It&#8217;s the verb! Since is used exclusively with the <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/uses-of-participles/">present perfect tense</a>&#8212;and not the <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/simple-past-verbs-in-english/">simple past tense</a>:</p>
 

  
    Verb tense: present perfect
    Action completed?
    <i>Since</i>
  
  
    I&#8217;ve worked here <b>since</b> January.
    &#10060;<br>(I still work here.)
    &#9989;
  
  
    We haven&#8217;t spoken <b>since</b> last year.
    &#10060;<br>(We&#8217;re still not speaking.)
    &#9989;
  
  
    It's been snowing <b>since</b> Friday.
    &#10060;<br>(It's still snowing.)
    &#9989;
  

 

 

  
    Verb tense: simple past
    Action completed?
    <i>Since</i>
  
  
    I worked here last January.
    &#9989;<br>(I no longer work here.)
    &#10060;
  
  
    We didn't speak last year.
    &#9989;<br>(We&#8217;re speaking again.)
    &#10060;
  
  
    It snowed on Friday.
    &#9989;<br>(It stopped snowing after Friday.)
    &#10060;
  

 
<h2 id="when-to-use-for">When to use for</h2><p>For refers to &#8220;for <strong>how long</strong>?&#8221;, and is used for durations of time rather than specific points in time. Unlike since, the preposition for is used with numbers and more general lengths of time.</p><h3 id="1-use-for-with-numbers">1. Use for with numbers&#160;</h3><p>Whenever the length of time is a number, use for.</p><ul><li>I've lived here for <strong>5 years.</strong></li><li>I waited for <strong>3 days</strong> before my package finally came.</li><li>I've been waiting for the doctor for <strong>90 minutes.</strong></li></ul><h3 id="2-use-for-for-general-lengths-of-time">2. Use for for general lengths of time</h3><p>When the time we&#8217;re referring to is vague or unspecific (we can&#8217;t pinpoint exactly when it started) we use for.</p><ul><li>I've been waiting here for <strong>a while.</strong></li><li>I've lived there for <strong>a few years.</strong></li><li>I've been a member here for <strong>decades.</strong></li></ul><p>As you can see, what follows for is different than what follows since!</p><h3 id="verb-form-used-with-for">Verb form used with for</h3><p>Unlike since, for can be used with both the simple past tense and the present perfect tenses. That's because for can imply that the action continues until now (just like since)&#8212;but it doesn&#8217;t have to!</p>
 

  
    Verb tense: present perfect
    Action completed?

    I've lived here <b>for</b> 5 years.
    &#10060;<br>(I still live here.)
    &#9989;
  

 

 

  
    Verb tense: simple past
    Action completed?
    <i>For</i>
