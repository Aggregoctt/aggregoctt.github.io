title: What makes Canadian English unique?
---
<div>
                <p>What pops into your head when you think of <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/english-dialects/">English dialects</a>? Are you imagining British English, American English, and Australian English? There&#8217;s a variety that often gets overlooked: Canadian English!</p><p>Canadian English is the North American <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/dialect-vs-accent-definition/">dialect</a> spoken in Canada, and it has features of both British and American English. There are also dialects within Canada, and many of them have been shaped by Indigenous local languages, European languages, and even other dialects of English. For example, the Canadian English spoken in Newfoundland has influences from <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/irish-slang/">Ireland</a> and <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/scottish-words/">Scotland</a>!</p><p>Here are some of the ways that Canadian English is unique. &#127809;</p><h2 id="canadian-english-spelling">Canadian English spelling</h2><p>Canada has close history and ties to the United Kingdom, and as a result it has retained much of British spelling&#8212;but you&#8217;ll also find some American spellings, too!</p>

<h2 id="canadian-english-pronunciation">Canadian English pronunciation</h2><p>Similar to its spelling, Canadian English pronunciation has features of both British and American dialects. Let&#8217;s take a listen!</p><p>Here are some words that have retained a more British pronunciation:</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>pasta</li>
  <li>progress</li>
  <li>band</li>
</ul>
 

 
<p>But other pronunciations are uniquely Canadian. For example, out is pronounced differently in Canadian English than in other dialects&#8212;which means that in Canada, <i>out</i> and owl aren&#8217;t pronounced the same!</p>
 
<p>In the word out, the &#8220;ou&#8221; sound is produced higher in the mouth than standard American or British varieties. This is known as <strong>Canadian raising</strong>&#8212;the extra raising of the tongue&#8212;and is a hallmark of standard Canadian English.&#160;</p><p>But in Canada, owl isn&#8217;t pronounced the same way: That extra raising of the tongue to make the &#8220;ou&#8221; sounds (written as &#8220;ow&#8221; in owl) sound only happens before the consonant sounds &#8220;p,&#8221; &#8220;t,&#8221; &#8220;k,&#8221; &#8220;s,&#8221; &#8220;sh,&#8221; &#8220;f,&#8221; and &#8220;th&#8221; (a group called voiceless consonants).</p><h2 id="canadian-english-vocabulary">Canadian English vocabulary</h2>
 
<p>As with spelling and pronunciation, Canadian English shares vocabulary with both British and American English. One example is the word zed meaning the letter &#8220;z&#8221; (versus zee in the U.S.).</p>
 
<p>Canadian English also has words that are distinctly Canadian!</p>
