  others'

<div>
                <p>Almost as soon as you start studying Spanish, you&#8217;re bound to notice something frustrating: Many words look similar! This is especially true for the Spanish words for this, that, these, and the verb estar (one of the <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/ser-vs-estar/">verbs meaning &#8220;to be&#8221;</a>).</p><p>Here&#8217;s everything you need to tell these words apart and choose the one you want!</p><h3 id="in-this-post">In this post:</h3><ul><li><a href="#spanish-demonstratives-and-how-they-work" rel="noreferrer">Overview of Spanish demonstratives</a></li><li><a href="#spanish-words-for-this-and-these" rel="noreferrer">Words for this and these (este, esta, etc.)</a></li><li><a href="#spanish-words-for-that-and-those" rel="noreferrer">Words for that and those (ese, esa, etc.)</a></li><li><a href="#the-spanish-verb-estar-to-be" rel="noreferrer">Verb estar (to be) and its conjugation (estoy, est&#225;s, est&#225;, etc.)</a></li></ul><h2 id="spanish-demonstratives-and-how-they-work">Spanish demonstratives and how they work</h2><p>The words for this, that, these, and those are adjectives and nouns, and just like with all Spanish adjectives and nouns, you&#8217;ll need to keep the following in mind:</p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/what-is-grammatical-gender/">Grammatical gender</a>: Is the noun masculine or feminine?</li><li>Number: Is the noun singular or plural?</li></ul><p>(Still learning which nouns are masculine and feminine? There are <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/learning-grammatical-gender-rules/">patterns to look for</a>!)</p><p>Just like in English, Spanish uses versions of this and these to talk about things that are close or relevant to the speaker. They can be physically closer to you (<strong>this</strong> book vs. <strong>that</strong> book), closer in terms of time (<strong>this</strong> year vs. <strong>that</strong> year), or more important to the conversation for another reason (<strong>this </strong>idea vs. <strong>that</strong> idea). Spanish works like this, too!</p><p>Here&#8217;s how you&#8217;ll use that information to find the right form of the word.</p><h2 id="spanish-words-for-this-and-these">Spanish words for this and these</h2><p>English has a word for singular nouns (this) and plural nouns (these)&#8212;and Spanish takes it a step further by also changing words according to gender. Here are the Spanish words for this:</p>
 


  
     
    Word for <i>this</i>
    Example
    Translation
  


  
    Masculine singular
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">este</span>
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Este libro es mi favorito.</span>
    This book is my favorite.
  
  
    Feminine singular
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">esta</span>
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Esta casa es nueva.</span>
    This house is new.
  


 
<p>There are also different forms for these (the plural form of this) depending on whether the noun is masculine or feminine:</p>
 


  
     
    Word for <i>these</i>
    Example
    Translation
  


  
    Masculine plural
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">estos</span>
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Estos libros son mis favoritos.</span>
    These books are my favorites.
  
  
    Feminine plural
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">estas</span>
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Estas casas son nuevas.</span>
    These houses are new.
  


 
<h3 id="how-to-say-this-one-and-these-ones">How to say this one and these ones</h3><p>Note that este, esta, estos, and estas can all be used <strong>without</strong> a noun following them to mean &#8220;this&#8221; or &#8220;this one.&#8221;</p>
 


  
     
    Word for <i>this (one)</i> and <i>these (ones)</i>
    Meaning
    Example
  


  
    Masculine singular
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">este</span>
    this one
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Este es mi juguete favorito.</span><br>This (one) is my favorite toy.
  
  
    Masculine plural
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">estos</span>
    these ones
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Estos son mis colores favoritos.</span><br>These (ones) are my favorite colors.
  
  
    Feminine singular
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">esta</span>
    this one
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Esta es mi canci&#243;n favorita.</span><br>This (one) is my favorite song.
  
  
    Feminine plural
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">estas</span>
    these ones
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Estas son mis galletas favoritas.</span><br>These (ones) are my favorite cookies.
  


 
<p>You might also see the above words spelled with an <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/spanish-accent-marks/">accent mark</a>: &#233;ste, &#233;stos, &#233;sta, and &#233;stas. This used to be the standard way to write them, but now the standard is without a written accent!</p><h3 id="esto-and-estos">Esto and estos</h3>
 
<p>Finally, there are two words for &#8220;this&#8221; or &#8220;these&#8221; that you can use when you&#8217;re referring to something abstract or ambiguous or when the noun is unknown: esto and estos. Unlike the words above, which can occur before a noun, <i>esto</i> isn&#8217;t used with a noun and can stand on its own to mean &#8220;this&#8221; or &#8220;this one.&#8221; (This also means that estos <a href="#spanish-words-for-this-and-these">follows *both* patterns</a>!)
</p>
 

 


  
    Example
    Translation
    Reason for &#8220;este&#8221; or &#8220;esto&#8221;
  


  
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Me gustan todos los perros, pero este es mi favorito.</span>
    I like all the dogs, but <b>this one</b> is my favorite.
    <i>este</i> because we&#8217;re referring to a specific dog, which we know is masculine
  
  
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Se cancel&#243; la fiesta, &#161;y esto es malo!</span>
    The party got canceled, and <b>this</b> is bad!
    <i>esto</i> because we&#8217;re talking about a general or abstract situation
  
  
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">&#191;Qu&#233; es esto?</span>
    What is <b>this</b>?
    <i>esto</i> because we&#8217;re referring to something unknown
  


 
<h2 id="spanish-words-for-that-and-those">Spanish words for that and those</h2><p>The Spanish words for that and those work the same way! These forms are the same as those for this and these, <strong>but without the &#8220;t.&#8221;</strong></p>
 


  
     
    Word for <i>that</i>
    Example
    Translation

<h3 id="how-to-say-that-one-and-those-ones">How to say that one and those ones</h3><p>Ese, esa, esos, and esas can all be used alone, just like este, esta, estos, and estas:</p>

<h3 id="eso-and-esos">Eso and esos</h3>
 
<p><a href="#esto-and-estos">Just like esto and estos</a>, you can also use eso and esos to stand in for abstract, ambiguous, or unknown nouns. And just like esto, you&#8217;ll never see eso before a noun&#8212;it&#8217;s always used alone.</p>

    Translation
    Reason for &#8220;ese&#8221; or &#8220;eso&#8221;

    What is <b>that</b>?
    <i>eso</i> because we&#8217;re referring to something unknown
  


 
<h2 id="the-spanish-verb-estar-to-be">The Spanish verb estar (to be)</h2><p>There&#8217;s another word that sounds a lot like the this/that/these/those words&#8230; but thankfully, it&#8217;s entirely unrelated!</p><p>The verb estar is one of the <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/ser-vs-estar/">Spanish verbs meaning &#8220;to be,&#8221;</a> and it&#8217;s used for locations, states, and in some compound verb forms (like <strong>is</strong> running). Since Spanish sentences don&#8217;t need to say the subject, you&#8217;ll need to pay close attention to the endings of estar to know who did the action!</p><p>Here are its forms in the present tense:</p>
 


  
    Present tense of <i>estar</i>
    Example
    Translation
  


  
    (yo) estoy
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Estoy en la oficina.</span>
    I am in the office.
  
  
    (t&#250;) est&#225;s
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Est&#225;s en la oficina.</span>
    You are in the office.
  
  
    (&#233;l/ella/usted) est&#225;
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Est&#225; en la oficina.</span>
    He/she is in the office.<br>You are in the office.
  
  
    (nosotros/nosotros) estamos
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Estamos en la oficina.</span>
    We are in the office.
  
    
    (vosotros/vosotros) est&#225;is
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Est&#225;is en la oficina.</span>
    You all are in the office.
  
    
    (ellos/ellas/ustedes) est&#225;n
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Est&#225;n en la oficina.</span>
    They are in the office.<br>You all are in the office.
  


 
<p>Spanish is known for its many verb tenses, but there&#8217;s one in particular worth mentioning here&#8212;because these forms look even more similar to the demonstrative adjectives (este, esta, etc.): the present subjunctive. This form will be familiar to intermediate and advanced learners!</p><p>The present subjunctive forms of estar often have the same spelling as the demonstrative adjectives&#8212;but those accent marks make a difference in meaning and pronunciation! For all the demonstrative adjectives, the first syllable is stressed (louder and a bit longer), while for the subjunctive of estar, the <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/spanish-accent-marks/">syllable with the accent mark</a> is stressed:</p>
 


  
    Present subjunctive of <i>estar</i>
    Example
    Translation
  


  
    (yo) est&#233;
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Ojal&#225; est&#233; en casa a las cinco.</span>
    Hopefully I&#8217;ll be home at 5pm.
  
  
    (t&#250;) est&#233;s
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Ojal&#225; est&#233;s en casa a las cinco.</span>
    Hopefully you&#8217;ll be home at 5pm.
  
  
    (&#233;l/ella/usted) est&#233;
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Ojal&#225; est&#233; en casa a las cinco.</span>
    Hopefully he/she will be home at 5pm.<br>Hopefully you&#8217;ll be home at 5pm.

  
  
    (nosotros/nosotras) estemos
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Ojal&#225; estemos en casa a las cinco.</span>
    Hopefully we&#8217;ll be home at 5pm.
  
  
    (vosotros/vosotras) est&#233;is
    <span class="soundcite pcontent soundcite-loaded soundcite-play pcontent">Ojal&#225; est&#233;is en casa a las cinco.</span>

    Hopefully they&#8217;ll be home at 5pm.<br>Hopefully you all will be home at 5pm.

  


<i>Note: For the nosotros form of estar, the stressed syllable is &#8220;te,&#8221; in the middle of the word.</i>
