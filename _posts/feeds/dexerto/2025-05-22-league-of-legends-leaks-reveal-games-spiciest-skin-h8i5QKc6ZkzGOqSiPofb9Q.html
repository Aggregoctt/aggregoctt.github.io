<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A League of Legends leaker has revealed a new &#8220;Spa Day&#8221; skinline, which will include a particular skin many dub as a fanservice.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Having been released all the way back in 2009, League of Legends is today known for its wide roster of champs as well as a plethora of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/top-10-best-christmas-skins-in-league-of-legends-3015432/">cosmetic lines</a>. From the iconic <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/k-da/">K/DA</a>, Star Guardian, Dark Cosmic, and Spirit Blossom skins, among many others, anticipating the next set of skins is something many in the community often enjoy.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 21, 2025, new leaks circulated all over <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/LeagueOfLeaks/status/1924881948754719040">social media</a> about &#8220;Spa Day&#8221; skins inspired from Eastern bathhouses, which will include Ahri.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Although it&#8217;s expected that the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/best-league-of-legends-champions-every-role-lol-tier-list-2995456/">popular champ</a> would also be included in the new line, considering how she&#8217;s <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/lol-devs-defend-450-faker-skin-and-players-are-fuming-2773426/">been treated cosmetic-wise</a>, the way this skin was described has caught many players off guard.</p>



<h2 id="h-league-of-legends&#8217;-spa-day-towel-only-ahri-skin-leaked" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">League of Legends&#8217; Spa Day towel-only Ahri skin leaked</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to the leaker, this Ahri skin will be a Legendary one. Now, you may be thinking about a design that has plenty of little details. Well, as it turns out, it&#8217;s quite the opposite. The leaker said this skin features Ahri wearing only a towel.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Even YouTuber <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbh2ugS4Q-s">BigBadBear</a>, the source of the leak, clarified this further in his video by writing: &#8220;Ahri is wearing a towel. Just a towel. No, I&#8217;m not kidding.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Though this is still a leak and nothing is, of course, confirmed, fans couldn&#8217;t help but share their thoughts on social media. Some of them even went as far as poking fun at Riot&#8217;s financial situation.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Yeah, they&#8217;re going broke lmfao,&#8221; commented one user.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Financial situation seems a lot worse than we thought guys, I repeat it seems to be a lot worse,&#8221; said another.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That said, there were also others who celebrated after this information was shared.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One user wrote: &#8220;Thank the heavens some fan service is in route. After what happened to Leblanc&#8217;s cleavage, I lost all hope of the game being fun again.&#160; All brutal joking aside, I&#8217;m curious to see what we actually get.</p>
