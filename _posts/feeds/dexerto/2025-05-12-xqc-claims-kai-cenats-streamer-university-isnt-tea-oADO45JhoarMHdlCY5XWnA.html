<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Twitch star xQc isn&#8217;t impressed by Kai Cenat&#8217;s upcoming Streamer University and thinks its courses are missing an extremely important skill.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In May 2025, Kai Cenat finally confirmed his Streamer University would be taking applications after first <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/kai-cenat-has-massive-university-plan-to-help-twitch-streamers-with-mrbeast-involved-3131895/">announcing the project months prior</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The university is designed to help take 150 rising creators and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/kai-cenat-finally-launches-streamer-university-everyone-wants-in-3190825/">turn them into superstars</a> by offering a series of courses that will be hosted at a real as-yet unspecified college campus.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While numerous people have signed up, one big name in the streaming space, Felix &#8216;xQc&#8217; Lengyel, doesn&#8217;t believe the &#8220;university&#8221; will actually help creators take their content to the next level.</p> 



<h2 id="h-xqc-slams-kai-cenat&#8217;s-stream-university-courses-as-&#8220;useless&#8221;" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">xQc slams Kai Cenat&#8217;s Stream University courses as &#8220;useless&#8221;</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">During a May broadcast after Kai&#8217;s big reveal, Lengyel checked out the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://streameruniversity.com/">Streamer University website</a> and was confused by some of the courses offered.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The site lists &#8216;sex education,&#8217; &#8216;business management,&#8217; &#8216;music production&#8217; and &#8216;film and acting&#8217; as courses.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Dude, they need to change this low-key to &#8216;react,&#8217; &#8216;stalling,&#8217; &#8216;event hosting,&#8217; &#8216;fake drama,&#8217; &#8216;clip farming&#8217; &#8211; that&#8217;s what you got to know!&#8221; the French Canadian said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what you got to know. You don&#8217;t need any of this sh*t.&#8221;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to the Kick star, who <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/xqc-implies-historic-kick-deal-actually-nets-him-more-than-100-million-2184312/">signed a $100M contract</a> to stream on the platform, the biggest skill for streamers is being able to stall.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Stalling is the most important, notable skill of live broadcast,&#8221; he said before turning his attention back to Kai&#8217;s courses. &#8220;Most of this sh*t is useless. Most of the live content is superfluous content. You need to be able to stall hard. People have been meta advancing stalling for years.&#8221;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Stalling typically involves playing for time waiting for a guest to show up, jumping from topic-to-topic on the fly, and still finding a way to be entertaining for viewers.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For his part, Kai Cenat has remained adamant that his Streamer University is the real deal and will be beneficial to the 150 people who get approved.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In response to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/kai-cenat-hits-back-at-claims-streamer-university-is-a-scam-3194111/">Los Pollos TV&#8217;s dad calling the program a &#8220;scam,&#8221;</a> Kai claimed that he simply hadn&#8217;t done his research on his plans and that the concept as a whole was &#8220;hard to fathom.&#8221;</p>
