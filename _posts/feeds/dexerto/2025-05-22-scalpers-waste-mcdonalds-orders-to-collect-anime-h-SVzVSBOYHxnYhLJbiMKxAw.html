<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, in order to get their hands on the Happy Meal toys, customers have been forgoing the food and creating a slew of waste in the process.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a video posted on X, bags upon bags of Happy Meal orders were left on the counters of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/mcdonalds/">McDonald&#8217;s</a> for staff to clean up after scalpers had taken their toys and left.</p>
