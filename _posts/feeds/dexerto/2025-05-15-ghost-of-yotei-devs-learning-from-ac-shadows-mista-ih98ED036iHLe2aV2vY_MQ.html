<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Sucker Punch leans on research and reverence to avoid the backlash swirling around Ubisoft&#8217;s Japan-set title when they release <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/ghost-of-yotei-2909932/">Ghost of Yotei</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Set in feudal Japan like <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-dlc-3053786/">Assassin&#8217;s Creed Shadows</a>, Ghost of Y&#333;tei also features a revenge-driven warrior, sprawling open-world exploration, and a rich historical backdrop.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But as Ubisoft faces ongoing scrutiny in Japan, Sucker Punch is making its moves with visible caution.</p>


 


<h2 id="h-ghost-of-y&#333;tei-moves-carefully-as-assassin&#8217;s-creed-shadows-stirs-cultural-controversy" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Ghost of Y&#333;tei moves carefully as Assassin&#8217;s Creed Shadows stirs cultural controversy</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Assassin&#8217;s Creed Shadows sparked <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-devs-thank-fans-for-heartwarming-support-despite-backlash-3168995/">widespread backlash</a> in Japan following its announcement. The game upset many in Japan because it showed sacred places, like shrines and temples, in violent game scenes. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">People also criticized the game&#8217;s historical mistakes and felt the characters didn&#8217;t reflect real Japanese culture. Some thought the game used Japan just for profit, without true respect.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A petition against the game garnered over 100,000 signatures. Lawmakers and religious leaders weighed in, particularly after trailers showed in-game destruction of shrine artifacts. Ubisoft later issued a patch to limit this, but not before the controversy escalated.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Sucker Punch, by contrast, appears to have taken notes.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/15/ghost-of-yotei-how-sucker-punch-chose-hokkaido-for-the-games-setting/">PlayStation Blog post</a>, Game Director Nate Fox detailed the team&#8217;s approach: multiple research trips, time spent with locals, and a strong focus on cultural authenticity.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;As a bunch of Americans we knew how ignorant we were about Japanese culture. To help start to solve that problem we met with a wealth of knowledgeable individuals and visited important cultural sites,&#8221; Fox wrote.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Set in 1603 Hokkaido, then known as Ezo, the game follows Atsu, a woman seeking revenge in a land still wild and mysterious. Developers chose the region specifically for its dramatic tension.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Hokkaido is unbelievably beautiful and in 1603 it was the edge of the Japanese empire,&#8221; Fox noted. &#8220;This combination of beauty and danger spoke to us.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The team&#8217;s hikes through bear-marked forests and awe-inspiring landscapes shaped their vision. &#8220;That experience was magic! A perfect marriage of beauty and danger, that was the exact feeling we wanted for our game,&#8221; Fox recalled. &#8220;For me, that was the moment I knew Hokkaido was the right choice.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With Ghost of Y&#333;tei launching this fall, comparisons to Ghost of Tsushima and AC Shadows are inevitable. Sucker Punch has big shoes to fill and an entire culture to honor. So far, they&#8217;re stepping lightly.</p>
