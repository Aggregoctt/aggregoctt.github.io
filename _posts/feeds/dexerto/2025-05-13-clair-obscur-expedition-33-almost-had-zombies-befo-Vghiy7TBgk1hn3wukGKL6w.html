<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Before <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> became an <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-a-storytelling-masterclass-3185573/">elegant fever dream</a> of existential horror, it nearly had zombies.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Also aliens. And, according to narrative lead Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, a completely different, &#8220;Victorian steampunk&#8221; setting.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Clair Obscur is a stylish, turn-based RPG set in a beautifully grim Belle &#201;poque-inspired world. No zombies in sight. Yet. Players control the 33rd doomed expedition from the island of Lumi&#232;re, where a magical artist called the Paintress erases people from existence every year.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But back in its concept phase it&#8217;d looked like foggy London, gaslights, and undead and little green men.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This game was very different,&#8221; Svedberg-Yen told <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-narrative-lead-jennifer-svedberg-yen/">TheGamer</a>. &#8220;It was set in steampunk Victorian England with zombies, aliens, and various things.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Apparently, they&#8217;d spent six months on this version. Then an investor dared them to dream bigger.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So they did. Hard reset. Story, setting, and tone got scrapped. The gameplay loop stayed. A few character names survived the purge.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">What rose from the ashes was something deeply personal. Inspired by a painting and a short story, Clair Obscur pivoted toward art, grief, and surrealist world-building. Guillaume&#8217;s mom helped.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As Svedberg-Yen shared: &#8220;He asked her, &#8216;What&#8217;s the worst thing that could happen to you?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Losing a child.&#8217; And the Gommage, the game&#8217;s terrifying central event, was born.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">And while the world is painterly, moody, and French, don&#8217;t mistake it for light fare. A certain character&#8217;s demise shocked players, but it was planned from day one. Svedberg-Yen insists plot twists were never improvised. &#8220;I need to have the answers,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pet peeve when writers wing it.&#8221;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">She credits the game&#8217;s impact to a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/clair-obscur-expedition-33-cast-characters-2951676/">dream team cast</a>: Andy Serkis, Charlie Cox, Jen English, Ben Starr, and others. They all bringing lots emotion to every line. &#8220;I had chills,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They made my words better.&#8221;</p>
