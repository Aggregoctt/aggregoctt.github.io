<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While it may say <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/borderlands/">Borderlands 4</a>, we&#8217;re now seven games into the franchise, with each release bringing the unforgettable style and gameplay many have come to love. However, there are also features that many have come to find increasingly frustrating.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In Borderlands 3, one of the primary irritations was the loading times, with fans growing more frustrated with the stop-start nature of the looter shooter. Well, that is now no more, after CEO Randy Pitchford revealed that there will be absolutely no loading times in Borderlands 4.</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-will-have-no-loading-times-with-instant-fast-travel" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Borderlands 4 will have no loading times with instant fast travel</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">During the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvsx1FzIKEg">Gearbox show at PAX East 2025</a>, fans were treated to just over an hour of Q&amp;As and reveals for Borderlands 4.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One of the main reveals happened 40 minutes into the show, in which Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford revealed that &#8220;there&#8217;s no load times&#8221; in Borderlands 4. &#8220;Massive world, no load times. There&#8217;s no dog legs or anything binding people together,&#8221; added Pitchford, who detailed that this is &#8220;the biggest universe that we&#8217;ve built and it&#8217;s seamless&#8221; thanks to the lack of loading times.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As previously mentioned, loading times were a large frustration in Borderlands 3, but it seems like Gearbox has taken that and run with it, ensuring that the game will be utterly &#8220;seamless&#8221; despite the larger scope. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This is all complemented by the ability to fast travel to your friends at any given moment, allowing you to stay fully connected and teleport to them in an instant, without those long loading screens.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It seems Borderlands 4 is set to utterly reimagine the franchise, making it a smoother experience, and those eliminated loading times are sure to be a breath of fresh air for plenty of the community.</p>
