<div>
<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ever since Sadie Sink joined the cast of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/spider-man-4-everything-we-know-2006937/">Spider-Man 4</a>, aka Brand New Day, speculation about who she&#8217;s playing has run rampant. But the latest suggestion from the rumor-mill raises a major question about the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/every-marvel-cinematic-universe-movie-tv-show-in-development-1849946/">upcoming Marvel movie</a>.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Tom Holland will be reprising his role as Peter Parker, following on from the multiversal mayhem that was <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/spider-man/">Spider-Man</a>: No Way Home. At the end, Peter made the huge sacrifice of erasing himself from everyone&#8217;s memory to reset his life and protect his loved ones.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, while <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/bringing-zendaya-back-for-spider-man-4-is-a-mistake-2612185/">Zendaya will reprise her role as MJ</a>, there will be a new dynamic due to the events of the previous film, paving the way for a new female lead. Enter Sadie Sink. The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/stranger-things/">Stranger Things</a> star was announced to have joined the cast earlier this year.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Since then, there have been <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/sadie-sink-breaks-silence-on-spider-man-4-and-jean-grey-rumors-3163797/">rumors that she&#8217;ll be playing X-Men&#8217;s Jean Grey</a>, but now a new suggestion has been made: Mayday Parker, the daughter of Tobey Maguire&#8217;s Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson.</p> 



<h2 id="h-sadie-sink-rumored-to-play-mayday-in-spider-man-4" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Sadie Sink rumored to play Mayday in Spider-Man 4</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Hollywood commentator John Rocha <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/BM2OoL02Hg0">shared</a> the rumor on his latest podcast episode, saying he&#8217;d received a message that Sink might be playing Mayday/Spider-Girl in the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/marvel/">MCU</a> movie.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If it&#8217;s true, it raises the question: will <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/spider-man-4-title-accidentally-gives-away-the-villain-3173764/">Spider-Man 4</a> be a multiverse movie? After all, Tom Holland&#8217;s Spidey is far too young to have a teenage daughter, meaning Sink&#8217;s character would have to come from an alternate universe.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The multiverse concept was, of course, a major part of No Way Home, where multiple versions of Spider-Man shared the screen &#8211; including Maguire and Andrew Garfield&#8217;s.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Bringing in Mayday Parker would expand this narrative, potentially linking the old Maguire trilogy with the current MCU storyline in a big way. Or, Marvel might reinvent Mayday&#8217;s character, changing her backstory to fit within Holland&#8217;s timeline.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This would be a bold move and might confuse fans familiar with the comics, but Marvel has shown it&#8217;s willing to take creative liberties in the past. Even the most recent movie <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/thunderbolts-review-marvel-3186529/">Thunderbolts</a> shook its team up in a massive way.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For now, fans will have to wait patiently for more official announcements &#8211; and keep an eye on Sink, who&#8217;s quickly becoming one of the most intriguing young stars in Hollywood.</p>
