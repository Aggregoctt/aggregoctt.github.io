<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rockstar reportedly changed plans for remasters of its iconic games after the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition was panned by fans.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In May 2025, Rockstar insider Tez2 revealed that the studio was going to be <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-insider-claims-rockstar-is-set-to-release-gta-4-remaster-for-new-consoles-3194365/">rereleasing GTA 4 for modern consoles</a> with Max Payne 3 to follow, if the devs stuck to a plan they had from back in the pandemic days.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Originally, there was some debate about whether or not this would be a remaster or a port, with the former being a much larger project than the latter.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Tez would later clarify that GTA 4 <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-insider-doubles-down-on-gta-4-re-release-but-dont-get-too-excited-3195759/">wouldn&#8217;t be getting a full remaster</a> and that all he knew that the project had entered development in 2024.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, on May 22, Tez revealed new details about Rockstar&#8217;s plans for remakes, claiming that things changed from what was originally discussed back in 2020.</p>



 



<h2 id="h-rockstar-insider-claims-gta-trilogy-caused-&#8216;significant-changes&#8217;-to-planned-remakes" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Rockstar insider claims GTA Trilogy caused &#8216;significant changes&#8217; to planned remakes</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a post on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1001950-gta-vi-trailer-2-analysis/page/19/#comment-1072554262">GTA Forums</a>, Tez explained that he never confirmed a Max Payne 3 remake was in the works, and if it was, it would be a port.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Rockstar/Take-Two had a plan on paper, back in 2020, for remasters, and MP3 was listed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This plan changed significantly after the release of GTA Trilogy DE. Anyhow, I have no idea if a MP3 port is in the works or not, so to be safe, assume it&#8217;s not.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In 2021, Rockstar released GTA Trilogy: The Definitive Edition. The remasters, developed by Grove Street Games, were <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/opinion/gta-trilogy-a-definitive-failure-for-rockstar-games-1699397/">slammed by fans and critics</a> for poor character models, technical issues, the removal of music tracks, and numerous other concerns.</p>  


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As such, according to Tez, GTA Trilogy&#8217;s performance caused Rockstar to change course.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The insider had previously suggested that a Max Payne 3 port, if it was real, could be bundled alongside Remedy Entertainment&#8217;s <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.remedygames.com/games/max-payne-1-2-remake">remasters of Max Payne 1 and 2</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;ll have to see what the studio decides to do and if the rumored GTA 4 port is indeed coming. Additionally, shortly after the GTA 4 news, reports surfaced that Rockstar would be <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/red-dead-redemption/red-dead-redemption-2-is-getting-next-gen-upgrade-and-switch-2-port-report-3196721/">upgrading Red Dead Redemption 2</a> for modern consoles as well as porting RDR2 to the upcoming Switch 2.</p>
