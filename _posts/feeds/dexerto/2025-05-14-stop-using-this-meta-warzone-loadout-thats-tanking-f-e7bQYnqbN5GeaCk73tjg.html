title: Stop using this meta Warzone loadout that’s tanking your FPS

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It turns out that using a meta <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/warzone/">Warzone</a> loadout could actually be harming your in-game performance, as it tanks your frames-per-second (FPS) when firing.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Grau 5.56 Assault Rifle was always strong, but has been <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/best-warzone-2-loadouts-class-weapons-tier-list-1986061/">catapulted into the meta</a> after the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/warzone-black-ops-6-may-7-update-patch-notes-3192854/">CR-56 AMAX was nerfed</a>. However, if you use the Monolithic Suppressor (the best one), your FPS will drop.   </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Warzone usually sits at around <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/best-warzone-2-settings-on-pc-for-higher-fps-1986083/">170 FPS for me</a>, but when firing the SWAT 5.56 with the Grau Conversion Kit and Monolithic Suppressor, my FPS plummets to 90. As soon as I stop firing, it climbs back up to 170. It&#8217;s only a problem when shooting, but that&#8217;s a pretty important aspect of the game. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Having a consistent FPS is extremely important as it makes aiming smoother and improves your reaction time, so having it drop every time you shoot puts you at a major disadvantage. </p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">I&#8217;ve tried it with the Monolithic Suppressor on the Kilo and AMAX, and my FPS doesn&#8217;t drop. Similarly, I&#8217;ve tried the Grau without the suppressor, and I don&#8217;t have the problem there either. It seems to just be a problem with that specific attachment combination &#8211; on PC, at least. </p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">I&#8217;m not the only one running into this issue, either. Popular YouTuber JGOD mentioned the problem in a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://youtu.be/omiH-xZO7Pw?si=gzSfBq2oot6Uz4rB&amp;t=358">May 8 YouTube video</a>, and players on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/TheDaniel187/status/1921951061692064243">X/Twitter</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/1km518u/monolithic_suppressor_fps_bug/">Reddit</a> have also called out the problem. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Since the Grau is a meta weapon that you definitely want to be using, you should instead use the Ported Compensator, which makes it even more of a laser beam. Or, if you&#8217;d rather stay off the minimap, the regular Suppressor will do the job, but the AR won&#8217;t be quite as good. </p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The devs haven&#8217;t responded to the issue at the time of writing, and it&#8217;s not the only bug in Season 3 Reloaded; they&#8217;re still investigating the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/warzone-devs-respond-to-crashing-issues-making-it-impossible-to-play-3192405/">crashing issues</a> which caused Ranked Play to be temporarily removed, a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/warzone-player-attacked-by-zombie-during-gulag-in-bizarre-bug-3194704/">player has been attacked by a zombie in the Gulag</a>, and an <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/game-breaking-warzone-glitch-lets-you-play-in-third-person-3195265/">exploit is allowing players to go in third-person</a> and get a major advantage. </p>
