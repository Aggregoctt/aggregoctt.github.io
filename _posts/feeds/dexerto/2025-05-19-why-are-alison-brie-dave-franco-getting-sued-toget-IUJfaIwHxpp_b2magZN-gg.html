<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Alison Brie and Dave Franco have been slapped with a lawsuit ahead of their upcoming <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/horror/">horror</a> movie Together, so here&#8217;s everything you need to know about the controversy and what it could mean for the film.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/new-movies-this-month-2504960/">new movie</a> from writer-director Michael Shanks sees the real-life married couple star as a fictitious married couple, whose move to the countryside turns into a nightmare when a mysterious force causes horrifying changes to their bodies.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Following its premiere at this year&#8217;s Sundance Film Festival, Together received overwhelmingly positive early reviews. Right now, it has a 100% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In short, there&#8217;s plenty of anticipation for the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-2025-horror-movies-3009603/">2025 horror flick</a>, but it&#8217;s now run into a massive issue thanks to a copyright infringement lawsuit against Franco, Brie, Shanks, and the production companies behind it.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-why-are-alison-brie-&amp;-dave-franco-getting-sued?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Why are Alison Brie &amp; Dave Franco getting sued?</h2>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Brie and Franco are among the defendants in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Together-Lawsuit-Dave-Franco-Alison-Brie.pdf">the lawsuit</a> filed by StudioFest on May 13, accusing Together of being a &#8220;blatant rip-off&#8221; of the 2023 movie Better Half.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For the uninitiated, Better Half is an indie film that centers on two people who meet for a one-night stand, only for their bodies to fuse during sex.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The complaint claims that StudioFest, a production, financing, and distribution company, acquired the exclusive rights to develop and produce Patrick Phelan&#8217;s script for the 2023 film, with the aim of casting Brie and Franco in the lead roles.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;In 2020 it submitted the Better Half script and synopsis directly to Franco&#8217;s and Brie&#8217;s agents at WME. Defendants Franco and Brie passed on the offer to star in the project,&#8221; it reads.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;But in January 2025, plaintiff learned that Franco and Brie were producing and starring in a virtually identical film entitled Together, written and directed by another WME client, Michael Shanks.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Together is a blatant rip-off of Better Half. Both works center around a couple who wake up to find their bodies physically fused together as a metaphor for codependency.&#8221;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It goes on to accuse the Together team of copying other creative elements from the plot, themes, characters, dialogue, mood, setting, pace, and sequence of events, before being bought for $17 million by <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-neon-horror-movies-2518189/">Neon</a>.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Better Half producers Jess Jacklin and Charles Beale even went to Together&#8217;s premiere at Sundance to see if there were similarities.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;As the audience laughed and cheered, Jacklin and Beale sat in stunned silence, their worst nightmare unfolding,&#8221; the complaint continues.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Scene after scene confirmed that defendants did not simply take &#8216;stock ideas&#8217; or &#8216;scenes a faire&#8217; but stole virtually every unique aspect of Better Half&#8217;s copyrightable expression.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It highlights a list of similarities between the two <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-horror-movies-all-time-2338495/">horror movies</a>, from dialogue and themes to characters and plot. Bizarrely, it claims they end in the same way: with the couple pulling out a vinyl record of the Spice Girls album Spiceworld while accepting their fate.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;By engaging in the conduct described above, defendants have committed and continue to commit copyright infringement,&#8221; it says.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The lawsuit is seeking monetary damages for StudioFest, and for any profits the defendants earned from the alleged infringement to be handed over to them under copyright law, although no specific amount has been announced.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-together-agency-claps-back-at-allegations" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Together agency claps back at allegations</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While Brie and Franco have yet to publicly respond, WME &#8211; the agency representing both the actors and Shanks &#8211; has issued a rebuttal to the allegations.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A spokesperson for the talent agency told <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://ew.com/alison-brie-dave-franco-copyright-lawsuit-together-movie-called-rip-off-11734733">EW</a>, &#8220;This lawsuit is frivolous and without merit. The facts in this case are clear, and we plan to vigorously defend ourselves.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This kind of response suggests the agency views the lawsuit as an attempt to cash in on the success of Together, particularly after its Sundance acclaim and multi-million-dollar acquisition by Neon.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As of now, no court date has been set. Copyright infringement cases like this can take months (or even years) to progress, and many are quietly resolved out of court through settlements &#8211; especially if both parties want to avoid prolonged negative publicity or delays to release schedules.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That being said, Together is currently scheduled to hit theaters on July 30, 2025. Whether this lawsuit will delay the release is still unknown. If the case proceeds to court, the situation could become more complicated.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But unless StudioFest seeks and is granted a preliminary injunction (which would block release), the film&#8217;s rollout will likely move ahead as planned.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Still, legal battles like this can affect marketing or <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-streaming-services-2641341/">streaming service</a> deals, especially if new information emerges or the case drags on. One way or another, Together will be under a much brighter spotlight &#8211; for better or worse.</p> 



<h2 id="h-what-the-public-is-saying" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">What the public is saying</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While the reaction to the case is mixed, one detail in the lawsuit stands out more than others: the Spiceworld reference at the end.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Taking to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1kls1kj/dave_franco_alison_brie_sued_for_copyright/">Reddit</a>, one wrote, &#8220;The Spiceworld thing may be the dumbest thing I&#8217;ve ever heard if true and whoever was responsible for stealing it OK&#8217;d it in any way. You could maybe get around the Zeus thing&#8230; but the Spice Girls thing is insane.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Another agreed, &#8220;Yeah, the Spiceworld thing is the real smoking gun, and the plaintiffs should be focusing more on that in the press. A lot of this can be attributed to linear thinking in court, but the Spiceworld bit is so so specific in a way that just can&#8217;t be explained away.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Yeah, I was a little skeptical because multiple people having the idea of a couple fusing together isn&#8217;t that outlandish to me but this definitely seems a little suspect,&#8221; added a third.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A fourth chimed in, &#8220;I think the crucial component here is that Brie and Franco were offered and had read the script for the original film and then shortly thereafter came up with the same concept &#8216;independently.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
