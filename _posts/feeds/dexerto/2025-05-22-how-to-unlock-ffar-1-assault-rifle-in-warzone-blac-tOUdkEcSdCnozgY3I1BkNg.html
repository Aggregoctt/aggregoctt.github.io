<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The FFAR Assault Rifle returns in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-season-4-update-3194203/">Black Ops 6</a> and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/warzone-season-4-update-3189994/">Warzone Season 4</a>, and it&#8217;s set to be an excellent sniper support option in battle royale.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The FAMAS has been in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/">Call of Duty</a> for a long time, and although traditionally a 3-round burst, Black Ops tends to offer it as a fully automatic option. Cold War&#8217;s FFAR was a dominant choice in both multiplayer and Warzone, with its fast fire rate and low recoil lending itself to a sniper support option.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now called the FFAR 1, it returns in the Season 4 update on May 29, so here&#8217;s everything you need to know about unlocking it.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">You need to<strong> complete</strong> <strong>Page 6 in the Season 4 Battle Pass</strong> to unlock the FFAR 1 Warzone and Black Ops 6. If you don&#8217;t manage to unlock it by the end of Season 4, it&#8217;ll be available as an Armory unlock. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The new Assault Rifle is completely free, so don&#8217;t worry about having to shell out for the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-4-battle-pass-3198060/">Battle Pass</a> just to unlock it. However, buying the Battle Pass will unlock a Blueprint for it on Page 11. </p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s been <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2025/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-four-full-intel-revealed">described</a> as a fully automatic Assault Rifle with a &#8220;very high rate of fire and excellent CQB power, but slower handling and mobility.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Although it has a &#8220;blazing fast fire rate that rivals the SMG weapon class&#8221; and a rapid TTK, it also has a lot more recoil than a traditional AR. This means that once again, it&#8217;s set to be a fantastic sniper support option, dealing with enemies at close-mid-range while you use your <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/best-warzone-2-0-sniper-rifle-class-loadouts-attachments-setup-perks-1994527/">Sniper Rifle</a> for anything further away. </p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Season 4 update also brings the LC10 SMG, another powerful gun from Black Ops Cold War, that has &#8220;excellent accuracy and range, with a moderate rate of fire,&#8221; and Black Ops 4&#8217;s Essex Model 87 Marksman Rifle arrives through the John Wick spinoff, Ballerina, event. </p>
