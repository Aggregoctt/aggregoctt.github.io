<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Popular fast food chain Whataburger is being sued for nearly $1M after a man received onions on his burger, despite asking for no onions.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A wrong order at Whataburger could prove to be extremely costly, with a man claiming the addition of onions caused him to &#8220;suffer personal injuries.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On April 25, Demery Ardell Wilson filed a lawsuit against Whataburger after an order dispute that took place a year prior on July 24, 2024.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to the lawsuit, Wilson ordered a burger and specifically requested onions be removed. A standard burger at the fast <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/food/">food</a> chain contains a beef patty with mustard, tomato, lettuce, pickles and diced onion on a bun.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, when the man bit into his burger, he ended up having an allergic reaction because the onions weren&#8217;t removed.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The company further said that it didn&#8217;t know that any product Wilson purchased &#8220;was in a defective or unreasonably dangerous condition at the time.&#8221;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Wilson&#8217;s court filing states he&#8217;s seeking &#8220;monetary relief over $250,000 but less than $1,000,000.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Hadi Law Firm, the company representing Wilson, has worked with him before on a separate lawsuit involving Sonic drive-in.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In April 2023, Wilson claimed he needed medical attention after &#8220;feeling sick&#8221; because his burger had onions on it.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Sonic has <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.kens5.com/article/news/local/texas/houston-texas-man-sues-whataburger-1-million-burger-onions/273-196d97b2-093e-4a73-adbe-0839005671e2">requested</a> a jury trial in that case. The chain had a similar response to Whataburger, believing Wilson should &#8220;be required to prove the charges and allegations.&#8221;</p>
