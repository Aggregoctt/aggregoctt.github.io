<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rapper Tee Grizzley is being accused of copystriking a YouTuber who claims he created a billion-dollar money glitch in the artist&#8217;s pay-to-win GTA Online server.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Tee Grizzley is a popular American rapper known for songs like &#8216;First Day Out&#8217; and &#8216;Robbery 8.&#8217; On top of his prolific music career, he also runs a server for <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/">Grand Theft Auto</a> Online, which players can pay to join and pay more money to access certain features once they&#8217;re in.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Essentially, it&#8217;s a pay-to-win server, where you can buy access to in-game content, VIP status or even administrator privileges using real-world currency.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">YouTuber &#8216;Parkerr&#8217; joined Grizzley&#8217;s server with the intention of exposing it as an alleged &#8216;scam,&#8217; claiming that the rapper is exploiting his fanbase for money. According to Grizzley himself, the server nets him <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyiBHASDW24&amp;pp=ygUVIHRlZSBncml6emxleSBwb2RjYXN0">around $50K weekly</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;After you pay the money to get into the server, you realize that it&#8217;s designed to make you spend more money,&#8221; Parkerr explained. &#8220;He&#8217;s got his own currency in there, called Black Diamonds, and it&#8217;s a one-to-one conversion to the US dollar. It&#8217;s crazy if you think about it.&#8221;</p> 


 


<h2 id="h-youtuber-claims-rapper-tee-grizzley-is-behind-dmca-for-exposing-his-gta-server" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">YouTuber claims rapper Tee Grizzley is behind DMCA for exposing his GTA server</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/">YouTuber</a> claimed he;d found a way to get in-game perks for free in Grizzley&#8217;s server by exploiting a &#8216;glitch&#8217; he&#8217;d discovered. Parkerr basically crashed the server&#8217;s economy by dropping cash on the ground in a secluded area, logging out, and logging back in.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In doing so, he managed to duplicate the money he&#8217;d dropped, as that amount instantly turned back up in his inventory when he logged in, while the cash he&#8217;d left behind was still on the floor.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In total, Parkerr was able to print $25M &#8212; something he says the rapper didn&#8217;t like.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As a result, he was hit with a Copyright Strike on his video exposing the situation, which has now been removed from YouTube.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The takedown notice was launched by one of the largest law firms in the entertainment industry, GDR Law Firm, who represent clients like A$AP Rocky and Zendaya among many other top celebrities.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Basically, I was able to give out money right in front of Tee Grizzley, and because he didn&#8217;t actually know what was going on, he ended up posting this video to his YouTube channel,&#8221; the YouTuber said.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, Parkerr is convinced that the takedown isn&#8217;t legit as his video was Fair Use, and is doing everything he can to fight the copystrike.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I&#8217;m not gonna let some big law firm bully me into not making this video,&#8221; he said. &#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m not gonna stay silent when big ole Tee Grizzley&#8217;s lawyers come for me.&#8221;</p>
