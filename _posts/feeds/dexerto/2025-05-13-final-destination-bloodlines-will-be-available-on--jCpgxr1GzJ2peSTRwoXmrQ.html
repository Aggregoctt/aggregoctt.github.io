<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Final Destination Bloodlines is about to his cinemas, while below you&#8217;ll find details of where the movie will initially stream.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Final Destination is one of the most acclaimed and successful series in horror history. Indeed, when we ranked the very <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-horror-franchises-ranked-3190287/">best horror franchises</a>, we stuck the movies at number three, writing:</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Death being the antagonist means the&#160;<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/every-final-destination-movie-available-on-streaming-before-bloodlines-3054987/">Final Destinations</a>&#160;lacks a memorable villain. But that ingenious concept&#160;also&#160;results in creative kills can come in any shape or form, with complicated chain reactions eliminating victims in tense scenes that play like bloody Rube Goldberg machines.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Following a lengthy hiatus after Part 5, the series is back via the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/final-destination-promotes-bloodlines-in-the-most-triggering-way-possible-3193462/">brilliantly marketed</a> Final Destination Bloodlines, so here&#8217;s everything you need to know about when and when to watch the sixth movie in the franchise.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-final-destination-bloodlines" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">How to watch Final Destination Bloodlines</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>Final Destination Bloodlines is exclusively playing in theaters from May 14, 2025 in the UK, and May 16, 2025 in the US.</strong></p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The sequel promises to &#8220;takes audiences back to the very beginning of Death&#8217;s twisted sense of justice,&#8221; while the official synopsis is as follows: &#8220;Plagued by a violent recurring nightmare, college student Stefanie heads home to track down the one person who might be able to break the cycle and save her family from the grisly demise that inevitably awaits them all.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fans should also expect the unexpected from FDB, as co-director Zach Lipovsky <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/final-destination-bloodlines-co-director-reveals-how-the-more-emotional-horror-sequels-opening-scene-is-going-to-make-fans-lean-forward-we-switch-up-a-lot-of-the-predictability/">told</a> SFX in an interview: &#8220;We love it when you have to lean forward in your seat because a movie is being unpredictable. We switch up a lot of the predictability, including who&#8217;s going to die next and how they are going to die. You might think it&#8217;s one person, but it&#8217;s not. There&#8217;s a delight in that.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-stream-the-horror-sequel" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Where to stream the horror sequel</h2>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>Final Destination Bloodlines will stream on Max first</strong>, due to the fact that it&#8217;s a Warner Bros. movie, and Max is the studio&#8217;s official streaming platform.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As for when that will happen, much depends on how the movie is doing in cinemas. For example, Barbie didn&#8217;t hit Max for 147 days because it was still filling theaters on its way to nearly $1.5 billion at the box office. But a more modest hit like Godzilla x Kong took 97 days, while for Dune: Part Two it was 81 days. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Horror can sometimes be fast-tracked to capitalise on marketing and social media interest, but based on the above, Final Destination 6 probably won&#8217;t hit Max until early August. </p> 



<h2 id="h-will-final-destination-6-stream-on-netflix?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Will Final Destination 6 stream on Netflix?</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>Final Destination Bloodlines could hit Netflix at some point in the future</strong>, but it probably won&#8217;t be until 2026.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Max will be the priority for Warner Bros, as a new Final Destination could encourage fresh sign-ups for the streamer. However, there is precedent for recent movies moving to&#160;<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a>&#160;after a run on Max, with Dune: Part Two making the move in January 2025.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That was a 225-day gap, so don&#8217;t expect to see Final Destination 6 on Netflix until the very tail-end of 2025 if it happens, and more likely early 2026.</p> 



<h2 id="h-when-will-final-destination-bloodlines-arrive-on-digital?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">When will Final Destination Bloodlines arrive on digital?</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>Final Destination could be available on digital as early as July 2025</strong>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Warner Bros hasn&#8217;t announced a release date yet, but taking Dune: Part Two as a template, the studio dropped its digital release 46 days after the film&#8217;s theatrical debut. If Final Destination Bloodlines takes the same route, it would release digitally on July 1, 2025.</p>
