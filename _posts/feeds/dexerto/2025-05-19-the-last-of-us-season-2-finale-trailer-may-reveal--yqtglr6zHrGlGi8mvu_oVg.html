<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s a big clue about one character&#8217;s fate in the trailer for <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-3176859/">The Last of Us Season 2</a> finale &#8211;&#160;and if you&#8217;ve played the games, you know exactly what&#8217;s coming. Huge spoilers to follow&#8230; </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Episode 6 of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/the-last-of-us/">The Last of Us</a> focused almost entirely on Joel and Ellie, exploring their relationship before the second season. We saw <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-future-days-continuity-error-3196201/">Joel playing &#8216;Future Days&#8217;</a>, their trip to the museum, and we found out exactly what happened to Eugene. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;re less than one week away from the finale, and big questions remain; will Ellie find Abby, where is Tommy, and how will it end? Season 3 has already been green-lit, so prepare yourself for a cliffhanger. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fans of the game may have an inkling as to what could happen in Episode 7 &#8211; and the trailer all but confirms it. </p>



<h2 id="h-jesse-may-be-in-trouble-in-the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Jesse may be in trouble in The Last of Us Season 2 finale </h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The trailer for the finale only lasts around 25 seconds, but there are some big teases in there. We see Jesse and Ellie out on the streets of Seattle together, Isaac leading a WLF squad&#8230; somewhere, Ellie being captured by Seraphites, Dina tearfully (and perhaps painfully) looking at Jesse, and Ellie traveling across a stormy sea on a boat. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At the 0:17 mark, there&#8217;s a quick shot of Jesse and Ellie running in the theater. It may mean nothing, but it&#8217;ll be familiar to people who played The Last of Us Part 2. This is your last chance to stop reading&#8230; </p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the game, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-jesse-fate-part-2-3194301/">Jesse is shot and killed by Abby.</a> After Ellie returns from the aquarium (no spoilers about what happens there), they decide to return home before anyone else gets hurt. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As they plan out their route back to Jackson, Ellie and Jesse hear Tommy scream out from the lobby. As they burst through the doors, Abby shoots Jesse in the head, killing him instantly.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">From the reaction to the trailer, it&#8217;s clear that other fans have clocked it. &#8220;STAY AWAY FROM THAT DOOR JESSE,&#8221; one user commented.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;So this season is definitely gonna end with Ellie and Jesse running out of the theater and we&#8217;ll pick up on Abby&#8217;s side in Season 3,&#8221; another viewer predicted. &#8220;Jesse about to catch a bullet with his cheek if this is where we&#8217;re at in the story,&#8221; a third wrote. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I think we all know that the next episode will end with Abby arriving at the theater and Jesse dying,&#8221; a fourth commented. &#8220;Ellie and Jesse are just racing to grab the last slice of pizza right? RIGHT???&#8221; a fifth joked. </p>
