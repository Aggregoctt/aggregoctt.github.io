<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For a six-pack of Smartwater, fans would need to fork out $90 and that&#8217;s not counting a possible tip either.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking of water, six Bud Lights would set festivalgoers back $140.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Charge whatever you want for alcohol. Should be illegal to charge that for water,&#8221; one slammed.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Pack of zero alcohol White Claws&#8230;.$90. I have no words,&#8221; another chimed in.</p>
