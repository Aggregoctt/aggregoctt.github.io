<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/andor-season-2-finale-episode-10-11-12-release-time-3194614/">Andor Season 2</a> ends tonight, bringing the entire show to a close and directly into the path of Rogue One &#8211; which is exactly why you should never expect to see Season 3. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Without Rogue One, you could argue that Lucasfilm wouldn&#8217;t have the confidence to go ahead with The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, and any other recent projects outside the mainline saga. It was a billion-busting, acclaimed success &#8211; and little did we know, the best was yet to come. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/andor/">Andor</a> is the highest-rated live-action <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> project ever, following the titular spy in the early years of the Rebellion as he works to weaken the Empire.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The last three episodes are hours away from dropping on Disney Plus, and if you&#8217;re still in denial about it coming to an end (or out of the loop), this is why it can&#8217;t continue. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-andor-season-3-will-never-happen-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Why Andor Season 3 will never happen </h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>Andor Season 3 is basically impossible to make, because it already exists&#8230; in the form of Rogue One</strong>: A Star Wars Story, the 2016 spinoff that follows Cassian and Jyn Erso as the Rebels try to steal the plans for the Death Star. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">By the time the credits roll on Season 2&#8217;s finale, there won&#8217;t be any story left to tell: the final three episodes cover &#8220;the last three days before&#160;Rogue One,&#8221; according to Tony Gilroy. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Remember, the first season took place over a single year, while Season 2 has split four years&#8217; worth of storytelling into four blocks of three episodes. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Rogue One&#160;is more about an event than the actual journey of [the] characters. It&#8217;s quite amazing to start a show where it&#8217;s not about where we can end &#8211; it&#8217;s about, how did we end there?&#8221; Gilroy told Empire. </p>  


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fortunately, Rogue One is available to stream on Disney Plus right now, so as soon as you&#8217;re done watching Andor, you can see what happens next. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Diego Luna told <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/star-wars-tv-shows/andor-star-diego-luna-urges-star-wars-fans-to-watch-rogue-one-immediately-after-season-2-ends-youre-going-to-see-it-differently/">SFX</a>: &#8220;If you have your DVD or Blu-ray of Rogue One, you should plug it in as soon as the season ends, and you&#8217;ll see a film that will be resignified.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;You&#8217;re going to see it differently, with so much information you didn&#8217;t have before. You knew nothing about this bunch of Rebels that got together and made this sacrifice, and then we did a show of 24 episodes about one of them. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I definitely believe it&#8217;s going to change the experience because it&#8217;s now so full of answers &#8211; almost many more than you even wanted when you watched Rogue One, like who Cassian&#8217;s mother was, what was the first droid he had a strong connection with, how his bedroom was&#8230; You&#8217;ve seen enough of this man now that you will go, like, &#8216;Holy sh*t, that&#8217;s what he meant?'&#8221;</p>
