<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fortnite players aren&#8217;t happy with the requirement to get the Darth Jar Jar skin in the current Star Wars-themed season.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We first saw Darth Jar Jar in Chapter 6, Season 3 reveal trailer. After seeing him blasting lightning from his hands, there has been a lot of hype since then, as fans look forward to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/fortnite-battle-pass-3182670/">this skin being released</a>.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fast forward to now, the highly anticipated skin has finally hit the shop after the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/fortnite-35-10-patch-notes-3194066/">35.10 update</a>. Instead of celebrating, however, it&#8217;s already met with backlash from the community.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Unlike most skins, this one essentially requires you to actually grind the game, something that many aren&#8217;t fond of.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite&#8217;s-darth-jar-jar-skin-requires-you-to-earn-over-1-million-xp-to-unlock" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Fortnite&#8217;s Darth Jar Jar skin requires you to earn over 1 million XP to unlock</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Yes, you read that right. Even though <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/fortnite-darth-jar-jar-skin-3194165/">Darth Jar Jar</a> is in the Item Shop, unlike all the other skins, you&#8217;ll need to earn a total of 1,28 million XP to be able to buy it for 1,500 V-Bucks. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That&#8217;s just the price for the skin alone, without all the other cosmetics.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Simply put, the skin is currently locked behind the XP grind. If you don&#8217;t meet this requirement, then it&#8217;s simply not available to purchase.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, you have to play the game and rack up XP before spending V-Bucks to actually get it. Of course, when you do all the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/all-fortnite-weekly-challenges-amp-quests-2741946/">weekly, story, and all the other challenges</a> available in-game, it&#8217;s possible to get this amount of XP.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, the problem is that not everyone has the luxury to play often, and even if they do get to play, there&#8217;s only a little over two weeks left to play in the current season.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Epic has <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/darth-jar-jar-descends-upon-the-fortnite-shop">confirmed</a> that this skin will be leaving the shop on June 6, 2025, which is around the time the next live event will take place to wrap up the current season.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Not only that, but all the XP you&#8217;ve obtained this season won&#8217;t count. So, even if you do purchase it now, despite already having a high level this season, you&#8217;ll need to start the grind all over again.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/fortnite-how-to-get-og-renegade-raider-aerial-assault-trooper-skins-3012871/">isn&#8217;t the first time Epic has done something like this</a>, as the OG cosmetics, which returned in December 2024 also had a similar requirement. Regardless of that, though, many were caught off guard and flocked to social media to express their frustration.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As one user in a popular <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1kpwnbz/darth_jar_jar_is_the_scummiest_thing_epic_has/">Reddit thread</a> put it, the situation is &#8220;terrible.&#8221;&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">They wrote: &#8220;Not a style, it&#8217;s an entire separate skin. Not in a bundle, everything sold separately, totalling around 3200 bucks (robbery). And being gated behind an XP wall is a prerequisite to even having the PRIVILEGE to spend the aforementioned $32.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Many others in the comments were also quick to agree to this sentiment. &#8220;It&#8217;s so dumb that you have to grind XP JUST so you can BUY it. Not earn it, BUY IT. Why not just have us buy it outright? What&#8217;s the point of grinding it?&#8221; said another frustrated player.</p>
