<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ethan Hunt throws everything and the kitchen sink at his farewell mission-turned-destiny, making <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-2-release-date-trailer-cast-plot-2205910/">Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning</a> exactly the ending we needed.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/tom-cruise-ana-de-armas-relationship-rumors-3186318/">Tom Cruise</a> has already hinted he won&#8217;t be stopping his action antics anytime soon during the press tour, but at some point, the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/mission-impossible-movies-ranked-by-tom-cruise-stunts-2203641/">Mission: Impossible franchise</a> had to end. Watching film number 47 and praying he doesn&#8217;t crack a hip as he runs down the streets of Paris isn&#8217;t the legacy Ethan Hunt deserves.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This means the eventual final reckoning had to be showstopping: jumping out of planes, car chases, shootouts, and some unhinged stunt that ends up breaking the internet and a world record. Luckily for us, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/mission-impossible/">Mission: Impossible</a> 8 delivers the goods and then some, and Cruise hardly cracks a sweat.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While Ethan&#8217;s storyline feeds into the same moral message, the new movie makes one thing abundantly clear: creating this kind of cinema epic is exactly what Cruise was born to do, and we&#8217;re all bloody lucky to have been along for the ride for over three decades. True to his fashion, The Final Reckoning is absurdly long&#8230; but hey, everyone&#8217;s got time to see one more villain bite the dust, right?&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-what-is-mission:-impossible-&#8211;-the-final-reckoning-about?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">What is Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning about?</h2>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Picking up the events of Dead Reckoning, Ethan is still on a mission to stop The Entity &#8211; a self-aware rogue AI &#8211; from destroying all of mankind. We already know it&#8217;s got the ability to control people at any given time, with nobody knowing for sure if they&#8217;re talking to The Entity or a real person.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Having been off-grid with the Cruciform Key in order to stop the world from imploding, President Erika Sloane (Angela Bassett, who we last saw in Fallout) coaxes Ethan into surrender. But Mission: Impossible 7 villain Gabriel (Esai Morales) is intent on trying to control The Entity, meaning Ethan&#8217;s playing against the US government and Gabriel in the fight for control and destruction.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Assembling a team of familiar faces, Ethan&#8217;s final mission is to get The Entity&#8217;s source code from the Sevastopol and destroy it once and for all. Of course, death, disaster, and a million logical impossibilities all lay in wait.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-a-touching-tribute-to-30-years-of-ethan-hunt-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">A touching tribute to 30 years of Ethan Hunt&#160;</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">From the opening moments of Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning, its ensemble pays tribute to the entire franchise. If you&#8217;ve not seen the seventh movie and can&#8217;t bring yourself to binge the three hours before your cinema trip, don&#8217;t panic. Alongside lots of touching tributes and flashbacks to each of the prior movies, The Entity neatly sums up Dead Reckoning audibly in under a minute. Basically, this is exactly the sort of thing we should be using AI for.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Not only is the impending AI and socio-political fallout painfully accurate to life in 2025, but no matter which way you look at it, it&#8217;s the biggest test Ethan&#8217;s ever had. The mission opens the floodgates for thrilling action in every setting, every scenario, and every moment someone else isn&#8217;t filling the screen. All roads lead back to him, and he&#8217;s a world away from the fresh-faced IMF agent we met back in 1996.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over that time, Ethan&#8217;s mission has become his destiny, even though nobody remains sure he can actually deliver the goods. So much so that he&#8217;s no longer being asked if he chooses to accept his mission (meaning we lose out on hearing the iconic catchphrase), because it&#8217;s just ingrained within him. Ethan and Cruise have all but fused into the same action man, and their intuition for what needs to be done is nothing short of exceptional.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s mind-boggling to think just how much physical and practical exertion had to go into the jam-packed three hours on screen. If you didn&#8217;t know any better, you&#8217;d likely assume Cruise was AI himself at this point. Destroying The Entity is a relentless pursuit, and you have to suspend a lot of belief to concentrate on the fact Ethan&#8217;s making progress. However, the payoff is immense, with The Final Reckoning&#8217;s action scenes up there as some of the franchise&#8217;s best.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Cruise aside, our ensemble cast is successfully crossing the minefield of possible action tropes. Hayley Atwell&#8217;s Grace remains an exceptional thief first and potential love interest second, while Bassett&#8217;s President of the United States is a role she was born to play. It&#8217;s Simon Pegg&#8217;s Benji who has the most personal growth, though, permanently shifting from quirky British sidekick to a leading agent all his own.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-plenty-of-easter-eggs-and-(finally)-some-answers" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Plenty of Easter eggs and (finally) some answers</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now, without delving into spoiler territory, let&#8217;s address the elephant in the review &#8211; Mission: Impossible 8 does indeed answer some years-old questions we&#8217;ve had hanging over our heads.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Granted, it&#8217;s not going to answer all of the franchise&#8217;s mysteries, but it shrewdly decides on the best threads to pick up and tie off. Ethan&#8217;s future is the most touching of all, with literally tributes bookending the insane bouts of action.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s no secret that CIA agent William Donloe (Rolf Saxon) from the first Mission: Impossible film is reprising his role, and that really tells you all you need to know about the quality and thoughtfulness of what we&#8217;re seeing. Everything is coming back full circle, and no part of Ethan&#8217;s journey has been overlooked, even if it was 30 years ago. What&#8217;s more, Donloe is used incredibly well, becoming an instrumental vehicle in doing the right thing rather than some far-away foe.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Obviously, this isn&#8217;t the only link back to movies gone by. Visual tributes are all well and good, but tangible Easter eggs are the stuffing of any good film series. Again, you&#8217;re going to find a good amount here, and while an understandably large chunk of detail comes directly from Dead Reckoning, there&#8217;s a healthy sprinkling of ones from movies 1-6 too.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s not all about the old, though. We&#8217;re not just looking at Ethan&#8217;s past, but his present too. An extra shoutout to newbies Tramell Tillman (aka Milchick in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/severance/">Severance</a>) and Katy O&#8217;Brien is due, making up the most charismatic team members covertly delivering Ethan to top-secret coordinates (though you can hazard a good guess where).</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Credit where credit is due to everyone involved here, because it&#8217;s just as clear they all love the franchise as much as they&#8217;ve enjoyed making the final instalment.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-mission:-impossible-&#8211;-the-final-reckoning-review-score:-4/5-&#8211;-great" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning review score: 4/5 &#8211; Great</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Whether you call him Ethan or Tom, Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning is the most satisfying tribute either could ask for. Cruise has raised the stakes for action, emotion, and impeccable storytelling, and no Mission: Impossible fan will walk away from the farewell feeling hard done by.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Yes, you will have a numb butt if you don&#8217;t take a toilet break and should prepare wisely if you&#8217;re seeing it in IMAX and are prone to motion sickness. But the payoff is glorious, exhilarating, and the best example of making the impossible possible.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning is in theaters from May 21, 2025.
