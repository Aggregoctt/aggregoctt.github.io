<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Streaming star Asmongold believes Twitch is &#8220;panicking&#8221; after apparently reducing SoLLUMINATI&#8217;s ban after he urged Kick to offer him a deal.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In early May, streamer SoLLUMINATI has his five-year-long Twitch ban lifted, allowing him to return to the Amazon-owned platform at long last. He didn&#8217;t waste any time at all, quickly returning to regular streams on Twitch.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, it hasn&#8217;t been without issue. SoLLUMINATI copped his first ban on May 4, with Twitch <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/twitch-streamer-unbanned-after-five-years-reveals-he-had-to-pass-test-to-get-ban-lifted-3190484/">requiring him to pass a test on &#8220;hateful&#8221; conduct to return</a>. He was banned again on May 20, shortly after having 87,000 viewers watching an NBA 2K wager broadcast.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/solluminati-unbanned-on-twitch-as-he-wants-kick-deal-instead-3198283/">That second ban prompted him to make a YouTube video,</a> urging Kick to &#8220;spoil&#8221; him with a contract offer to leave Twitch.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-asmongold-weighs-in-on-solluminati-twitch-ban" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Asmongold weighs in on SoLLUMINATI Twitch ban</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">His ban was lifted shortly after that video went live, with viewers and content creators suggesting Twitch did so in order to keep him around. Though, Adin Ross had already welcomed him to Kick.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The ban being lifted also caught the attention of Asmongold, who suggested it was a &#8220;panic&#8221; move from the Amazon-owned site.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It&#8217;s a panic. They&#8217;re panicking because they see a person who&#8217;s moving to another platform without being paid,&#8221; <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.twitch.tv/asmongold">he</a> claimed. &#8220;Here is the big fear Twitch has. Twitch is mostly afraid of content creators moving platforms without getting paid because the moment content creators move platforms without getting paid, that&#8217;s it, bro.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Twitch hasn&#8217;t confirmed whether the ban was lifted early for a specific reason. Yet, a second ban within a 30-day period would typically land you with a week-long suspension.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The timing between SoLLUMINATI&#8217;s video being released and the ban being lifted could be coincidental, but the theories aren&#8217;t stopping.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He revealed that he had plans to do bigger streams moving forward, but the ban has stopped that. &#8220;Twitch don&#8217;t even deserve me, man. I&#8217;m talking about bringing IRLs to Twitch and all this s**t? Man, y&#8217;all don&#8217;t even deserve me, man,&#8221; the streamer said.</p>
