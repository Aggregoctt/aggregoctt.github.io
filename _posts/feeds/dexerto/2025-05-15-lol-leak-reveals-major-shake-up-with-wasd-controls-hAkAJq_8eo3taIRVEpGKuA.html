<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">League of Legends could be implementing WASD controls with multiple settings to the game, according to a dataminer.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There is a reason why the &#8216;<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/arcane/">watching Arcane</a> vs playing <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/">League of Legends</a>&#8217; meme is a well-known joke in the community. Despite having an iconic cast of characters, LoL is a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/lols-most-dedicated-garen-main-has-never-made-it-out-of-bronze-3179477/">tough game to get into</a>, as not only does it require good game sense, but also mechanical skills, including mastering its click-to-move controls.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This movement mechanic has been part of LoL&#8217;s identity since it was released in 2009. All the while, though, many fans have questioned why Riot never implemented WASD controls in the first place, considering how this would make the experience of playing certain champs even smoother.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over a decade on, it appears that this option may finally be added to the game, according to a new leak that has emerged.</p>



<h2 id="h-league-of-legends-leak-reveals-wasd-controls-with-different-options" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">League of Legends leak reveals WASD controls with different options</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The WASD movement controls were first spotted by dataminer SkinSpotlights, who shared their discovery in a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/SkinSpotlights/status/1922367764619997217">post on X</a>, suggesting that Riot could be &#8220;experimenting&#8221; with this.&#160;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As it turns out, after digging into it thoroughly, they found out more details about this feature, including actual menu screens and settings related to it.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to the datamined information, there are essentially three options to choose from, which are:</p>



<ul class="pl-10 mt-1 overflow-y-hidden font-body text-body-1 text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white dark:text-body-1 dark:font-body mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text List_list___uTwY wp-block-list">
<li>Cursor</li>



<li>WASD with Cursor Enhanced</li>



<li>WASD with Cursor Fallback</li>
</ul>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Though right now, they&#8217;re still unsure what exactly these do in the game. That said, they did mention that it&#8217;s still possible to click to move under WASD. Additionally, there&#8217;s a toggle to &#8220;smart cast,&#8221; allowing you to show in the direction your character is facing.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The community&#8217;s reaction has so far been mixed following this reveal. On one hand, as seen in a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1kmcn11/wasd_movement_coming_to_league/">Reddit thread</a>, a lot of players were excited to play combo and movement-reliant champs like Riven and Draven with this new setting.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Though at the same time, there are also fans who are not a fan of having to relearn new controls after playing League for so long.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This is still considered a leak for now, as Riot has yet to announce anything. However, this setting could be a sure way to draw more players in and even change the game forever.</p>
