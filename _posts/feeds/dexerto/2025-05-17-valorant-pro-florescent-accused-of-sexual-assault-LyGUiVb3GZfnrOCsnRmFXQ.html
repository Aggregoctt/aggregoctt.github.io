<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">florescent, the first woman to make it to a Tier 1 Valorant league as a pro player, has been accused of sexual assaulting a former partner.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Earlier in 2025, Ava &#8216;florescent&#8217; Eugene <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/valorant/valorant-game-changers-mvp-set-to-join-apeks-to-compete-in-tier-1-2983346/">got signed to Apeks</a>, a European team, despite residing in North America. She was seen as one of the hottest 2025 prospect players after putting on consistent MVP performances in the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/valorant/vct-game-changers-2024-shatters-record-for-most-viewed-womens-valorant-event-2981880/">Game Changers league</a>. She stepped away from the team for personal reasons in April, but was still seen as one of the best players in the league.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, a former Game Changers player has come forward and called out flor on behalf of her friend, someone who claims to have been sexually assaulted by the Valorant pro.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The accusations include unwanted advances and physical injury as a result of those advances.</p>



<h2 id="h-game-changers-pro-accuses-florescent-of-sexual-assault" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Game Changers pro accuses florescent of sexual assault</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Valorant Game Changers pro karie <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/kar_ie/status/1923617491781034150">brought these accusations to light</a>, doing it on behalf of her friend who told her about her experience with florescent.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a google document that included screenshots from their text messages, a woman who goes by Brick claims she participated in sexual acts that were, at that point in time, consensual even if she felt pressured into it by Ava.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, she was in physical pain during the act and realized she was bloodied by the end. A while later, flor allegedly pressured her into doing it again despite Brick trying to explain she was physically injured and trying to find a way to exit the situation.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Regardless, she claims that florescent pushed her down and did it anyways.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s important to note that these allegations haven&#8217;t come from the victim herself but a friend, with karie putting together the Google doc and claiming Brick would come forward when she&#8217;s ready with the full set of accusations.</p>  


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;More things will come forward but you must give it time solely because this is a real person with real emotions and she is not ready to air out things that do not need to be aired out, and its very hard for her to reread and virtually relive the events that took place,&#8221; karie claimed.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s important to note that all of the text screenshots have no names or tags on them, only the text messages themselves. Additionally, many of the experiences karie spoke on that her friend experienced weren&#8217;t in the text messages that were shown.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While flor will surely have to respond to the allegations at this point due to how much the original post has blown up, the evidence shown so far is by no means damning. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;ll update if any more information comes to light, or if the accusations are corroborated by other people close to the scene.</p>
