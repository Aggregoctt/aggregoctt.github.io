<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Epic Games are in the process of trying to get <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> back on the iOS App Store in the US, but they&#8217;ve had to pull and resubmit their request after being left unanswered for over 120 hours. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In August 2020, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/fortnite-ios-app-store-mobile-2499147/">Fortnite was removed from the iOS App Store</a> in the US as Epic Games took a stand against Apple&#8217;s commission on in-game purchases. This led to a nearly five-year court battle, which ultimately ruled in favor of the developer. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, on May 1, 2025, it was announced that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/fortnite-finally-returning-to-ios-app-store-after-almost-5-years-3188333/">Fortnite would finally be returning to App Store</a> &#8220;next week,&#8221; and a request was sent to Apple for review on May 9. However, nearly a week later, the game was still nowhere to be seen, and the request had to be pulled and resubmitted. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite&#8217;s-return-to-us-app-store-hits-another-roadblock" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Fortnite&#8217;s return to US App Store hits another roadblock</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 14, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney revealed that after being stuck in Apple&#8217;s review process for nearly 120 hours, they had to cancel the process and start again so they could roll out the Fortnite <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/fortnite-35-10-patch-notes-3194066/">v35.10 update</a>, which is now due on May 16.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We need to release a weekly Fortnite update with new content this Friday, and all platforms must update simultaneously,&#8221; Sweeney said in an X post. &#8220;So we have pulled the previous Fortnite version submitted to Apple App Review last Friday, and we have submitted a new version for review.&#8221;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For context, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/#:~:text=On%20average%2C%2090%25%20of%20submissions,your%20submission%20may%20not%20pass.">Apple&#8217;s official website</a> says that &#8220;90% of submissions are reviewed in less than 24 hours,&#8221; so Epic were clearly expecting to be approved before this weekly update was released.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, they heard nothing after around five days, which is unusually long for this process. While Sweeny didn&#8217;t go as far as calling out Apple, he did post this reply when a fan asked how they didn&#8217;t plan for this kind of delay:</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Our release planning relies on platforms supporting app developers like us releasing apps. There is no way a rapidly evolving multi-platform game like Fortnite can operate if platforms use their power or processes to obstruct.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, with Fortnite now back to the bottom of the pile in Apple&#8217;s App Review, fans in the US will likely have to wait a little longer for the game to return to the iOS Store. </p>
