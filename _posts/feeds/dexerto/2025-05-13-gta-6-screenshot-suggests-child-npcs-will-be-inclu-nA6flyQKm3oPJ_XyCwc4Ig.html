<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Some GTA 6 fans are convinced that kids will be included as NPCs after users spotted what appears to be a child hiding in one of the game&#8217;s fresh screenshots.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rockstar Games shocked the world on May 6 when they suddenly released the second <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-rumors-story-and-more-for-the-next-grand-theft-auto-game-245713/">GTA 6</a> trailer, along with a slew of screenshots, character bios and location details.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Just as with the first trailer, fans started <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-fans-convinced-theyve-spotted-major-character-you-definitely-missed-3193184/">analyzing every single frame</a> and began doing the same with the screenshots, zooming in to get a better look at Vice City and the state of Leonida.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Interestingly, one of those screenshots is going viral after an NPC in the background caught their eye &#8211; and their inclusion could be a first for the open-world franchise.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-fans-think-rockstar-hid-a-child-in-one-of-the-screenshots" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">GTA 6 fans think Rockstar hid a child in one of the screenshots</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you navigate to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI/downloads/screenshots">Rockstar&#8217;s GTA VI site</a> and check out the screenshots, the file &#8216;Grassrivers 02&#8217; looks pretty innocent.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It features a stunning city skyline, people fishing on a boat, citizens at a restaurant and factories in the background. However, when zooming in on one of those restaurant tables, you can see what appears to be a child-like figure sitting down.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">X account &#8216;TheGTAVerse&#8217; tweeted a zoomed in version of the image, convinced that it was a kid. The screenshot spread like wildfire, amassing over 1.4M views.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;That&#8217;s gotta be a kid fr,&#8221; one user replied.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Not everyone was in agreement, though. Many felt the image just wasn&#8217;t clear enough when zoomed in and believed the &#8220;kid&#8221; could be a woman with short hair or simply a short NPC.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Another user posted a screengrab of a scene from the first trailer where two young boys appeared in the background playing in the mud, further suggesting that this wasn&#8217;t the first instance of kids being visible in promotional material.</p>  



   



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Kids haven&#8217;t been in any GTA game yet, and it&#8217;s easy to understand why. Even in a game where you can run over pedestrians or go on mindless rampages, eliminating children could be a step too far.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If kids are in fact in GTA 6, they could be handled in a manner similar to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/red-dead-redemption/">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, where players are unable to actually harm them.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">GameRoll, a user who has <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/leaker-proven-correct-about-gta-6-reveals-more-about-the-games-development-3194398/">correctly revealed info about VI</a> in the past, posed a theory about how child NPCs might function.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;If they put children in areas where cars can&#8217;t reach, that would actually be a genius way to implement them,&#8221; he <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/GameRoll_/status/1922090749895553103">wrote</a>. &#8220;Make them unshootable /unexplodable like in RDR2 too.&#8221;</p>
