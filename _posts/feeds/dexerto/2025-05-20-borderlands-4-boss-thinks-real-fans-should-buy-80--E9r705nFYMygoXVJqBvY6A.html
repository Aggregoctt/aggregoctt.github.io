<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford thinks &#8220;real&#8221; fans should find a way to buy Borderlands 4, even if the price does go up to $80. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The cost of games has been a hot topic in recent weeks. Both <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/former-playstation-boss-explains-why-nintendo-shouldnt-be-blamed-for-rising-game-prices-3190094/">Nintendo</a> and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/xbox-is-getting-more-expensive-with-big-global-price-hikes-3188720/">Microsoft</a> have confirmed that their games are set to go up in price, while industry analysts have predicted that bigger AAA releases like <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/rockstar-predicted-to-sell-gta-6-at-unheard-of-price-with-a-big-jump-3157696/">GTA 6 could go as high as the $100 mark</a>. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This all has fans increasingly worried about being priced out of their favorite games, including <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/borderlands-4-2619129/">Borderlands 4</a>. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The long-awaited sequel is due to drop on September 12, and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/borderlands-4-might-be-80-but-gearbox-ceo-doesnt-know-3193929/">Randy Pitchford has previously admitted that it could cost $80</a>. But the Gearbox Software CEO thinks that most dedicated fans of the series should find a way to get their hands on it, no matter the cost. </p>



<h2 id="h-randy-pitchford-claims-real-fans-will-&#8220;make-it-happen&#8221;-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Randy Pitchford claims real fans will &#8220;make it happen&#8221; </h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Responding to a fan calling for Borderlands 4 not to ramp up its price on Nintendo Switch 2, as some players might refuse to pay $80, Pitchford explained that it&#8217;s &#8220;not my call,&#8221; but argued that die-hard fans should figure out a way of getting the funds together. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;If you&#8217;re a real fan, you&#8217;ll find a way to make it happen,&#8221; said the reply. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He then went on to share a story from over 30 years ago, where he cobbled together the money to buy Starflight despite working a minimum wage job: </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen.&#8221;</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The response didn&#8217;t go down with some players, who felt that he was ignoring the real financial struggles that might prevent them from buying Borderlands 4. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Wow thats properly a bad take.. cost of living crisis and you&#8217;re just gonna say &#8216;if you&#8217;re a real fan&#8230;&#8217; damn,&#8221; said one reply. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;There&#8217;s no way you just said that dumbass sh*t in 2025,&#8221; added another.</p>
