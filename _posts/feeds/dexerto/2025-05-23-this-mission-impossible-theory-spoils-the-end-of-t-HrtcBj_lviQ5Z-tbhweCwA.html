<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning is in cinemas now, but we&#8217;ve noticed a plot point that potentially spoils the end of both the movie, and the franchise.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If long-standing rumors &#8211; and the film&#8217;s title &#8211; are to be believed, The Final Reckoning is the end of the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/mission-impossible-ranked-3195565/">Mission: Impossible franchise</a>. And if that isn&#8217;t the case, it&#8217;s almost certainly the last time we&#8217;ll see Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But the world&#8217;s biggest movie star is going out with a bang, as we wrote in our <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-3194820/">Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning review</a> that &#8220;Cruise has raised the stakes for action, emotion, and impeccable storytelling, and no <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/mission-impossible/">Mission: Impossible</a> fan will walk away from the farewell feeling hard done by.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Though while the series ends in emotional fashion, we clocked something early in the movie, that could change how everything that happens after is viewed. <strong>MAJOR SPOILERS</strong> ahead&#8230;</p> 



<h2 id="h-how-the-entity-wins-at-the-end-of-mission:-impossible-8" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">How The Entity wins at the end of Mission: Impossible 8</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ethan Hunt defeats The Entity at the end of Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning, but the conclusion is a little too neat, and that&#8217;s got us thinking that maybe his AI opponent ultimately got the upper hand.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">During the movie&#8217;s finale, Ethan survives a spectacular battle in the sky, as well as his parachute burning up as he tumbles to the ground. During that fall, Hunt fuses the Podkova with the Poison Pill, Grace ejects the 5D drive at just the right time, and BOOM, The Entity is trapped.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ethan makes up with Kittridge and Briggs, then heads for Trafalgar Square, where he shares a moment with Grace, Paris, Degas, and Benji, before the credits roll with nuclear war averted and the world saved. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But what if none of that was real? Throughout the movie, characters talk about living in The Entity&#8217;s &#8220;reality.&#8221; While early in the narrative, Ethan steps into the AI&#8217;s pod, dons the Entity&#8217;s head-gear, and receives a vision of what&#8217;s to come.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">What if that vision didn&#8217;t end, and the rest of Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning is an alternate reality that The Entity is broadcasting in Hunt&#8217;s head?</p>



<h2 id="h-ethan-hunt&#8217;s-new-reality-is-our-final-reckoning" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Ethan Hunt&#8217;s new reality is our Final Reckoning</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Moments after entering the pod, Ethan is retrieved by his friends, and asks, &#8220;Is this real?&#8221; as he touches them to prove they actually exist. The team assures Hunt he&#8217;s back in the real world, but we have no evidence of that beyond their words, meaning everything from here-on-in could be illusion; a fantasy playing in Ethan Hunt&#8217;s mind, to keep him occupied while The Entity does its worst.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The story couldn&#8217;t be too perfect either, for fear Ethan would smell a rat, and realise he&#8217;s in a virtual world. To counter that The Entity adds a spot of tragedy to maintain credibility. So someone close to Ethan dies, as during impossible missions, someone close to Ethan always dies. In this case, the unfortunate (apparent) victim is Luther.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Entity writes them a tearful farewell, and Luther bows out with an act of bravery that inspires Hunt, motivating him to save the day. But the death could also be an invention to keep Ethan convinced that what he&#8217;s experiencing is real.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So while the end of the movie is Ethan smiling at his colleagues before heading off into the London night, the real conclusion could be a hard cut to them standing around that pod, trying to wake Hunt from the dream designed for him, while The Entity wins, and nuclear bombs drop all around. </p>
