<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/warzone/">Warzone</a> players have discovered a glitch that lets you play in third-person, offering major advantages during a match. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Winning a match in Warzone is no easy task, so you need to use any means necessary to be the last one standing. This means running the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/best-warzone-2-loadouts-class-weapons-tier-list-1986061/">meta guns</a> and ensuring that your <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/best-warzone-controller-settings-aim-assist-sensitivity-response-curve-more-1542787/">controller</a> and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/best-warzone-2-settings-on-pc-for-higher-fps-1986083/">PC settings</a> are up to scratch. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But, sometimes, players can gain an upper hand using techniques that the devs didn&#8217;t intend. Now, players have uncovered a new glitch that changes your perspective from first-person to third-person. </p> 



<h2 id="h-how-to-do-third-person-glitch-in-warzone" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">How to do third-person glitch in Warzone</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As discovered by streamer HunterTV, the glitch is done by adjusting your camera settings while parachuting. Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide on what to do: </p>



<ol class="pl-10 mt-1 overflow-y-hidden font-body text-body-1 text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white dark:text-body-1 dark:font-body mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text List_list___uTwY wp-block-list">
<li>Head to Quick Settings and remove all your favorites. This will make life easier later. </li>



<li>Then, go into Graphics Settings and find Parachute Camera Perspective. </li>



<li>Make sure it&#8217;s set to &#8220;3rd Person (Infill Only).&#8221;</li>



<li>Add it to the favorites.</li>



<li>Load into a match on any Warzone mode.</li>



<li>Land on a building or ledge high enough for you to deploy your parachute.</li>



<li>Jump off, pull your parachute, and open the settings while gliding.</li>



<li>Switch from &#8220;3rd Person (Infill Only)&#8221; to &#8220;3rd Person.&#8221; </li>



<li>Then quickly switch back to &#8220;3rd Person (Infill Only).&#8221;</li>



<li>When you leave the menus and touch ground, you&#8217;ll be in third-person for the rest of the match.</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t pull your parachute again for the rest of the match, as this resets the camera. </li>
</ol>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This game-breaking glitch grants some serious advantages over the rest of the lobby, the main one being extra visibility. From the over-the-shoulder perspective, you can peek around corners without actually having to leave cover, so you&#8217;ll know enemies are there long before they spot you.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Those who have pulled off this trick also claim that it buffs the aim assist in every fight, to make up for the lack of iron sights. So, while it doesn&#8217;t offer the same level of accuracy as first person, you&#8217;re given extra help to stay on target. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s already causing issues in-game, as fans have even <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1922432914349821998">reported</a> coming up against players using this exploit in Ranked Play.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There are some drawbacks, though, as pulling the parachuting again at any time in the match will reset the camera. To get around this, a Perk like Mountaineer is useful, as it reduces fall damage if you do find yourself on a roof with no other way out. </p>
