<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Dangerous Animals revolves around a serial killer obsessed with crafting &#8220;the greatest show on earth,&#8221; and the movie itself does something similar, delivering thrills, laughs, and above all, scares.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This isn&#8217;t a surprise, as Dangerous Animals is directed by Sean Byrne, a filmmaker who has made just two films in 15 years. But his debut feature was the marvellously macabre The Loved Ones in 2009, followed by ferocious heavy metal <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/horror/">horror</a> The Devil&#8217;s Candy in 2015, which made Byrne two-for-two.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With Dangerous Animals a decade on, I&#8217;m excited to say he&#8217;s now three-for-three, and much of that is down to Nick Lepard&#8217;s water-tight script, which is both ruthlessly efficient and masterfully executed.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Jai Courtney has also never been better as the film&#8217;s deranged villain, while Hassie Harrison&#8217;s final girl is as kick-ass as they come, and does something that has to be seen to be believed in one of the movie moments of the year.</p> 



<h2 id="h-what-is-dangerous-animals-about?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">What is Dangerous Animals about?</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On the surface, <strong>Dangerous Animals is about man-eating sharks</strong>. But as with any film of this ilk, the real villain of the piece is man, and in Bruce Tucker, the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/new-movies-this-month-2504960/">new movie</a> features a bad guy for the ages.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It isn&#8217;t really a spoiler to say Tucker is the film&#8217;s antagonist, as he&#8217;s unmasked in the movie&#8217;s opening scene, where Bruce agrees to take two friends out on the ocean for some shark cage action. But it isn&#8217;t long before Tucker shows his true colors,&#160;and they are several shades of red, as he spills blood and the sharks surrounding his boat get fed.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Once the villain is established, the two heroes of the piece are introduced; Zephyr, a surfer who loves the ocean more than land, and Moses, an estate agent who&#8217;d also rather be out on the water.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Their paths cross via an effective meet-cute, and something develops between the pair, which Lepard&#8217;s script manages to initiate quickly and convincingly. But before the relationship can take flight, their love story collides with Tucker&#8217;s murderous plans, resulting in a tense race against time to stop him killing again.</p> 



<h2 id="h-jai-courtney-chews-the-scenery-up-then-spits-it-out" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Jai Courtney chews the scenery up then spits it out</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Dangerous Animals works because of Lepard&#8217;s script and Byrne&#8217;s direction, but Jai Courtney breathes additional life into the material via a performance that fills every frame of celluloid. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In his sizeable hands, Tucker exudes charm, charisma, and friendly menace, cracking gags that are pretty funny, but leaving little doubt that those who don&#8217;t laugh will face the consequences.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Whether telling jokes, dancing on his boat, or performing an unforgettable rendition of &#8216;Baby Shark,&#8217; he&#8217;s a very jolly psychopath, like some twisted cross between Steve Irwin, Shane Warne, and Wolf Creek&#8217;s Mick Taylor.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But he also has depths that are revealed throughout the story, from some pretty solid conservation ideas to a fascinating back story involving a shark attack that might have contributed to his god complex.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He&#8217;s also a serial killer that loves the sound of his own voice, and Tucker&#8217;s running commentary throughout his heinous crimes ensures the character really does mount an entertaining show.</p> 



<h2 id="h-zephyr-is-one-of-the-great-final-girls" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Zephyr is one of the great final girls</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Zephyr is a worthy opponent, however, and as played by <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/yellowstone/">Yellowstone</a> star Hassie Harrison, she&#8217;s also a fantastic final girl, managing to be tough and brave, but with a vulnerability that&#8217;s utterly beguiling.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Zephyr starts out fiercely independent, then falls for the charms of Moses and starts questioning her own world-view and decisions. But before those contradictions can be resolved, she falls into Tucker&#8217;s clutches, which is when and where Zephyr transforms into a true warrior.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Tucker enjoys the challenge, because he &#8220;loves a fighter.&#8221; But Bruce might have bitten off more than he can chew with this one, as Zephyr&#8217;s determination and bloody-mindedness drives her will to survive.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Indeed, at one point, Zephyr does the most badass thing I think I&#8217;ve ever seen a horror heroine do, and while I could barely watch the screen when it was happening, the sequence in question is also likely to have audiences punching the air.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Zephyr and equally brave Moses aside, the other heroes of Dangerous Animals are the sharks themselves, with Tigers, Bulls, Makos, and Great Whites captured in jaw-dropping underwater action, then doing what sharks do when called upon, in truly memorable fashion.</p> 



<h2 id="h-is-dangerous-animals-good?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Is Dangerous Animals good?</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Dangerous Animals is a film for fans of shark flicks or serial killer stories or movies that have you squirming in your seat as the horrors unfold onscreen.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">I could have done without a particularly dodgy one-liner that follows a key kill late in proceedings, but other than that, the film succeeds as a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-2025-horror-movies-3009603/">horror movie</a>, a romance, and even a comedy if you like your humor particularly dark.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So while greatest show on earth is probably stretching it, Dangerous Animals is a genuine crowd-pleaser that absolutely delivers on the promise of its high-concept premise.</p> 



<h2 id="h-dangerous-animals-review-score:-4/5-&#8211;-great" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Dangerous Animals review score: 4/5 &#8211; Great</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Dangerous Animals is getting a summer release, during a period that&#8217;s filled with bloated blockbusters weighed down by exposition and overstuffed ensembles. Mercifully, this is the exact opposite; a simple, straightforward horror romp that&#8217;s as lean and mean as the killing machines at its core.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Dangerous Animals is out on June 6, 2025.
