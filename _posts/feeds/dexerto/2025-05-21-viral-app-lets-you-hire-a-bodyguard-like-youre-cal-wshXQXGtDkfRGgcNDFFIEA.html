<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you&#8217;re in need of a bodyguard, a new app can let you hire one and it&#8217;s as easy as booking an Uber.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over the years there have been countless stories of streamers being <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/chinese-streamers-hand-reportedly-cut-off-after-man-attacks-him-with-sword-2157067/">attacked by strangers</a> and in dire need of protection and a new app is looking to provide just that.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8216;Protector&#8217; is available for users in LA and New York and lets anyone get private security on the fly with a ton of customizable options.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The app, which launched in February 2025, went <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/viral/">viral</a> on X in May when Collin Rugg shared videos about Protector which received over 7M views in a few days.</p>



<h2 id="h-&#8216;protector&#8217;-lets-you-hire-a-bodyguard-and-even-choose-what-they-wear" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">&#8216;Protector&#8217; lets you hire a bodyguard and even choose what they wear</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to founder Nick Sarath, finding security used to be an &#8220;unintuitive experience.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It&#8217;s like a maze that you have to go through to vet a bunch of different security websites,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Protectors on the app are either active or recently retired law enforcement or military members, too.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;They all come from top units within their departments or agencies such as SWAT, Emergency Services Unit, Air Force PJ and even SEAL teams,&#8221; he explained.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In videos, users delved into the app and were surprised by the results. Users can choose between how many Protectors they want to hire, select their dress code, pick-up location, the duration of the protection needed.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/protector-app-bodyguard-private-security-armed/">CBS</a>, a single Cadillac Escalade with one protector in West Hollywood would cost around $1,000 for five hours, but users would also need to pay a $129 annual membership fee. However, the cost can be split among a maximum of five people.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This could prove to be useful for <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/">Twitch</a> streamers and content creators as in 2025 alone there have been quite a few instances of people harassing them.</p>
