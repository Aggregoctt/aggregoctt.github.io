<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Jake Paul has revealed that he had a fight with a current boxing champion lined up, but it was shelved at the last minute due to a rematch he has to have.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When Jake Paul first stepped into the world of boxing, many pundits and fighters said that it wouldn&#8217;t last. His fights, initially, were just with MMA fighters looking to crossover. However, the &#8216;Problem Child&#8217;<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/jake-paul-boxing-record-all-opponents-fight-results-so-far-1891473/"> has carved out a nice record for himself.&#160;</a></p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The YouTuber-turned-boxer has wins over Mike Tyson, Andre August, and Ryan Bourland on that record, and has stated that he&#8217;s eager to keep fighting &#8216;real&#8217; boxers. His big goal? Win a world championship.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/boxing/jake-paul-roasted-as-canelo-mega-fight-scrapped-at-last-minute-3059248/">Jake was supposed to take on Saul &#8216;Canelo&#8217; Alvarez</a> in his annual Cinco De Mayo fight, but that was scrapped due to the Mexican signing a massive deal with Riyadh Season. But, it isn&#8217;t the only one on the table.</p> 



<h2 id="h-jake-paul-reveals-gervonta-davis-fight-talks" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Jake Paul reveals Gervonta Davis fight talks</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to Jake, he was negotiating with &#8216;Tank&#8217; Gervonta Davis &#8211; the current WBA lightweight champion &#8211; but that was nixed at the &#8220;one-yard line&#8221; following his draw with Lamont Roach Jr.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I mean that was on the one-yard line as well, but he has to rematch Lamont Roach. He wants to get that back, and then we&#8217;ll be back in discussions with Mr. Gervonta,&#8221; he <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/arielhelwani/status/1924580156427112566">told</a> Ariel Helwani on May 19.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Jake also claimed that the fight, which would have been an exhibition, would have been contested at 195 lbs. &#8220;Ten three-minute rounds, no restrictions, just the fact we couldn&#8217;t get it professionally sanctioned,&#8221; he added.&#160;</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That would be an interesting weight for the pair, given it isn&#8217;t far off where Jake fights anyway. However, Davis would have to balloon up, given that he usually fights at around 140 lbs.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Jake noted that it&#8217;s just &#8220;the nature&#8221; of boxing that fights get so close to happening and are scuppered late on. Yet, he&#8217;s hopeful that talks will pick back up in the future.</p>
