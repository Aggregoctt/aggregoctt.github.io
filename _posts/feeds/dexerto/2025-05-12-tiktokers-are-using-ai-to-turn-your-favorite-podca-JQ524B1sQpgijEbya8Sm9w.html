<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">TikTokers are using AI to turn your favorite podcasters into babies in videos that are taking over the social media app.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With the rise of AI, more and more programs have been released to help create new styles of content.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, released a way to turn a picture of yourself into <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/open-ai-boss-jokes-about-studio-ghibli-ai-slop-3171646/">Studio Ghibli-style artwork</a> back in March, prompting a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/studio-ghibli-partner-calls-out-viral-ai-trend-following-classic-film-rerelease-3172922/">response from a studio partner in the process</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now, users across <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tiktok/">TikTok</a> are using AI that takes a clip from their favorite podcasts and turns the hosts into AI-generated babies. </p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Back in April, comedian Jon LaJoie posted a video of his &#8220;talking baby podcast&#8221; that almost immediately went viral on TikTok.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Welcome to the talking baby podcast,&#8221; the video starts as Lajoie does the voice-over. In this podcast, he even included an AI-generated dog as the show&#8217;s guest.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Since then, people have been using the AI to turn their favorite influencers into talking babies and have even created specific accounts to showcase them. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One channel is specifically titled BabyPodcast, and shows baby versions of some of the biggest names in podcasting. With 11 million views, the account&#8217;s most popular video features Theo Von and Joe Rogan. </p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With 4.4M views, another features the Bad Friends podcast with Bobby Lee and Andrew Santino&#8230; and even got a response from Santino himself. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I&#8217;m. Bobby. Mom,&#8221; he said. </p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s unknown what&#8217;s being used to create the lifelike AI babies, but it&#8217;s not the first time an AI trend has taken over the short-form video app. </p>
