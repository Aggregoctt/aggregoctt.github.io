Host John Rocha asked if it&#8217;d be Nicolas Cage returning as Johnny Blaze, and Sneider said he &#8220;assumed&#8221; it&#8217;d be a new actor as a &#8220;search&#8221; is ongoing for someone to take on the role.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That leaves one question: who will it be? A few names have been thrown around by fans over the years, but there are two actors that may have a shot. </p>

I want to play Ghost Rider.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A year later, he also told the outlet: &#8220;Fingers crossed.
