<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">GTA 5&#8217;s unprecedented success continues to reach new heights in 2025 with total sales that not even GTA 6 may be able to surpass.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Originally released in 2013, the series&#8217; fifth mainline entry is one of the most successful entertainment products of all time, continuing to consistently sell copies long after its debut. Ports, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-has-achieved-an-unthinkable-steam-record-3158531/">upgrades</a>, and the behemoth that is <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/gta-online/">GTA Online</a> being packaged with the base game for free have all contributed to that longevity. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While its days as the series&#8217; newest entry are firmly numbered, now that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-officially-delayed-until-2026-3189190/">GTA 6 has a specific release date of May 26, 2026</a>, there&#8217;s still no shortage of first-timers wanting to hop in and explore everything San Andreas has to offer.</p> 



<h2 id="h-gta-5-2025-sales-surpass-5-million" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">GTA 5 2025 sales surpass 5 million</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In its May 2025 quarterly <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e8841ad4-15c4-4572-b4c4-0df5548df6ba">earnings report</a>, Take-Two, Rockstar&#8217;s parent company, confirmed that GTA 5&#8217;s total number of units sold had reached over 215 million. An increase of five million from February 2025, when <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/3ae54582-44bf-4163-9024-4da314c31541">Take-Two confirmed</a> that GTA 5&#8217;s total sales were more than 210 million.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">To put that figure into perspective, Take-Two announced that lifetime sales of all Grand Theft Auto games combined were &#8220;nearly 450 million&#8221; as of May 2025, making GTA 5 solely responsible for just shy of half of the franchise&#8217;s entire sales.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Whether GTA 6 will record similar or even greater sales success than its predecessor is impossible to gauge. Based on brand power alone, the series&#8217; sixth entry is guaranteed to strike it big, but GTA 5 is something of an anomaly, even for Rockstar.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With unconfirmed reports that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/rockstar-predicted-to-sell-gta-6-at-unheard-of-price-with-a-big-jump-3157696/">GTA 6 could launch with a price tag of $100</a> or more, many fans might find themselves priced out of 2026&#8217;s biggest game and opt for a cheaper, older alternative in its predecessor.</p>
