<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning concludes the Ethan Hunt saga in spectacular fashion, but it&#8217;s also long. Really long. So this is when we recommend stepping out if you need the bathroom.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Final Reckoning is the eighth &#8211; and seemingly final &#8211; film in the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/mission-impossible-ranked-3195565/">Mission: Impossible franchise</a>, and sees Tom Cruise&#8217;s Ethan Hunt going up against an evil AI called The Entity.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The film is in UK cinemas now, and we wrote in our 4-star <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-3194820/">Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning review</a> that &#8220;Cruise has raised the stakes for action, emotion, and impeccable storytelling, and no <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/mission-impossible/">Mission: Impossible</a> fan will walk away from the farewell feeling hard done by.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But the movie also clocks in at a whopping 2 hours 49 &#8211; which is a massive 169-minutes &#8211; so for those whose bladders can&#8217;t withstand that amount of time, here&#8217;s when to pop to the loo. Meaning mild <strong>SPOILERS</strong> ahead.</p>



<h2 id="h-head-to-the-bathroom-when-tom-cruise-swims-for-the-[object-object]-sub" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Head to the bathroom when Tom Cruise swims for the second sub</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We don&#8217;t recommend going to the bathroom during Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Destination as you&#8217;ll be doing a disservice to the action movie event of the year, as well as the conclusion to a franchise that&#8217;s been going for nearly three decades. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But if you absolutely, positively, categorically have to take a rest break, we recommend going at around the 90-minute mark, which is when Ethan Hunt exits the USS Bush, and swims towards the Sevastopol, when there&#8217;s a good 3-4 minutes during which little happens, and you can make use of the bathroom.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you need to go for longer, what follows is Ethan Hunt breaking into the Russian sub, and slowly and carefully makes his way through the vessel.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s a tense sequence, and if you&#8217;re a fan of underwater action, you might want to ignore this advice. But it also lasts for quite sometime &#8211; around 20 minutes &#8211; so if you do drop out for a bit, when you return it&#8217;s likely that Hunt will still be swimming from room-to-room.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Plus it&#8217;s also a silent sequence, with Ethan acting alone, meaning not a word uttered. So in a film that&#8217;s filled with exposition, you won&#8217;t be bypassing dialogue that again explains what The Entity is and how they plan to stop it.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So as long as you&#8217;re back in your seat by the time Hayley Atwell&#8217;s Grace reappears onscreen, you might have missed a cool mini-mission, but you won&#8217;t be lost when it comes to the film&#8217;s plot, as Ethan Hunt approaches his Final Reckoning. </p>
