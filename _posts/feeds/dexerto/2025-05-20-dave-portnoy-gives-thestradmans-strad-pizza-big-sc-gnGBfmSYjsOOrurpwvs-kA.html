<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Barstool boss and pizza reviewer Dave Portnoy branded David Dobrik&#8217;s pizza as &#8220;one of the worst pizzas&#8221; he&#8217;d ever eaten, but had better reviews for TheStradman.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Dave Portnoy&#8217;s &#8216;One Bite&#8217; pizza reviews have been an internet phenomenon. The Barstool Sports founder has changed the fortunes of a number of pizza joints by giving them a high-scoring review.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He reviews all sorts of pizza stores &#8211; family-run businesses that have been around for decades, brand-new ones that have popped up, and even the upmarket gourmet attempts at a slice. He always gets cheese, though, nothing else.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Portnony has also reviewed YouTuber&#8217;s attempts at breaking into the pizza game. He wasn&#8217;t a great fan of<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/david-dobrik-reveals-plans-to-make-reality-show-about-his-pizza-restaurant-2270966/"> David Dobrik&#8217;s &#8216;Doughbriks&#8217;</a> slice, giving it a 6.4. Yet, he was happier with TheStradman&#8217;s attempt with his Strad Pizza in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p>



<h2 id="h-dave-portnoy-gives-thestradman-7.8-pizza-review" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Dave Portnoy gives TheStradman 7.8 pizza review</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This was opened by a YouTuber? A car YouTuber,&#8221; <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ymVMsUNFA&amp;ab_channel=OneBitePizzaReviews">Portnoy</a> asked, as his cameraman filled him in about TheStradman&#8217;s channel that boasts almost 4.5 million followers. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you this, it&#8217;s 1000% better than the Dobrik pizza. One of the worst pizzas I&#8217;ve ever had, no offence, David Dobrik, your pizza is not good.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Barstool boss had a bit more praise for Stradman, however. &#8220;This? Pretty good! Yeah, this is pretty good.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That all-important final score? A 7.7/7.8. &#8220;This is good. So, the car guy, Strad Pizza, is making really good pizza. I don&#8217;t get the connection, but no doubt about it, this is good pizza. Strong score.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The YouTuber thanked Portnoy for dropping by on Instagram after the review had gone live. &#8220;Thanks for stopping by!&#8221; he said.&#160;</p>
