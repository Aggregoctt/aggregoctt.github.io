<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Season 17 is the next major update coming to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a>, and it&#8217;s set to bring new modes, maps, and much more. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Blizzard have been ramping up their seasonal updates in recent months. Season 15 marked the arrival of the game-changing <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-all-minor-major-hero-perks-listed-3130596/">Perks system</a>, while <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-season-16-patch-notes-3178758/">Season 16</a> brought hero bans and the popular <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/best-stadium-build-for-every-hero-in-overwatch-2-3182893/">Stadium mode</a> that has become a fan favorite. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">They&#8217;re showing no signs of slowing down either, as another stacked content drop is around the corner. Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about OW2 Season 17, including when it begins. </p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Overwatch 2 Season 17 is scheduled to begin on <strong>Tuesday, June 24, 2025</strong>, according to the Battle Pass timer displayed in-game. New seasons always go live as soon as the old one ends, so unless there&#8217;s a delay, this should be the date.</p>



<h2 id="h-map-voting-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Map voting </h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The biggest new feature coming in Season 17 is map voting, giving players more control over where each match takes place. </p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Once added, the lobby will be given a choice of three maps, and everyone can choose their favorite. The one that receives the most votes will be selected, much like in other games such as Call of Duty, which uses a similar system.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Two of the maps offered will be the least-played for everyone in the lobby, in an effort to keep things feeling fresh. Meanwhile, the third will be selected at random. </p>



<h2 id="h-payload-race-mode" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Payload Race mode</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After arriving in Season 16, Stadium is being treated to its first exclusive game mode as part of the next update. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-payload-race-mode-explained-3188908/">Payload Race</a> is a twist on the usual Escort format, where there are two payloads in play at once &#8212; one per team. Teams will need to focus on getting theirs to the finish line, while stopping the opposition from moving theirs, with the winner being whoever gets to the end first. </p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This will force teams to spread themselves out much more than normal, as you&#8217;ll essentially need a team to push the payload and another to go and disrupt. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When describing the mode, Senior Game Designer Dylan Snyder said:</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;In Payload Race, teams escort their payloads toward their destination, battling each other along winding pathways and evolving environments. This culminates in an exciting all-out brawl at the finish line, as the leading team attempts to close out their victory, and the trailing team does whatever they can to stop them.&#8221; </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This will likely lead to some vital decisions mid-match, as you decide whether to focus on your own payload, go and sabotage the enemy, as well as who should stay and go.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-flashpoint-map" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">New Flashpoint map</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Flashpoint has been stuck with just two dedicated maps ever since it released back in Season 6, but a third is finally coming in Season 17, as Game Director Aaron Keller confirmed. </p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It hasn&#8217;t been officially announced what this map will be or what it will look like, but based on a roadmap shown at OW2 Spotlight, it&#8217;s likely to be called Aatlis. Little else is known about the location or where it fits in the wider lore, but we expect to find out more about it in the coming weeks. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The same roadmap also confirmed that some map updates are coming in the update, but it&#8217;s clear right now which will be getting a makeover. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-a-new-hero-in-ow2-season-17?-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Is there a new hero in OW2 Season 17? </h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>No,  there won&#8217;t be a new hero this time around</strong>. Characters are released once every two seasons, and since Freja dropped in Season 16, we&#8217;ll have to wait a little longer for a new face to join the roster. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The good news is that with Aqua, the new Support, coming in Season 18, they will be made available in Quick Play as part of a limited trial towards the end of Season 17. This lets devs gauge the response to their kit and make any last-minute adjustments. </p>
