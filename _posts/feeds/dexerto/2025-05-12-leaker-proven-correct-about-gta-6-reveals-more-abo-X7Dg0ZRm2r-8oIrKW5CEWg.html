<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A GTA 6 leaker who correctly revealed Jason and Lucia&#8217;s last names before they were confirmed in trailer 2 has shared more info about the game&#8217;s development.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rockstar Games shocked the world in May when they unveiled the long-awaited <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-trailer-2-blows-fans-away-with-insane-graphics-on-base-ps5-3190716/">second trailer</a> for GTA 6 along with in-game screenshots and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/all-confirmed-gta-6-characters-3190548/">character bios</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The trailer also revealed the last names of VI&#8217;s two protagonists: Lucia Caminos and Jason Duvall.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As it turns out, a leaker had secretly revealed these names back in April after finding them out from a source at Rockstar and that person also had a bunch of knowledge about how delaying GTA 6 had to happen.</p> 



<h2 id="h-leaker-reveals-why-gta-6-delay-was-&#8220;absolutely-necessary&#8221;" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Leaker reveals why GTA 6 delay was &#8220;absolutely necessary&#8221;</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to &#8216;GameRoll&#8217; on X, the source they spoke to who confirmed the names of Jason and Lucia also said that <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">Rockstar</a> absolutely had to delay <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-rumors-story-and-more-for-the-next-grand-theft-auto-game-245713/">GTA 6</a> and couldn&#8217;t meet its Fall 2025 release window.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;One thing I&#8217;ll also say is that this source made it very clear to me that a delay to 2026 was ABSOLUTELY necessary,&#8221; they explained.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;If we had gotten GTA 6 in 2025, it would have been a significantly worse game. They began cutting a lot of cool stuff to try and make that deadline.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">GameRoll says he&#8217;s not a leaker and this was the only information he had about the game, but the fact he knew accurate info does lend a great deal of credibility.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As for what was being cut, GameRoll says the delay isn&#8217;t tied to GTA Online 2 or to &#8220;justify a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/ex-playstation-president-says-gta-6-needs-to-find-a-balance-to-avoid-100-price-3190123/">price increase</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, fellow insider and YouTuber LegacyKillaHD, who was right about one of the game&#8217;s heists being <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6s-second-trailer-proves-this-2024-leak-was-accurate-3190749/">similar to Fast and Furious 5</a> and a delay to 2026, indicated that things were being cut.</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Basketball minigame was worked on at the Toronto studio. It was on the chopping block at the end of 2023. Always the difficulty talking about a game active in development,&#8221; he said back in 2024.</p>
