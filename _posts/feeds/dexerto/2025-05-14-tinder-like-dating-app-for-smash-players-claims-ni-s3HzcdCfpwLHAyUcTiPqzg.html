<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A dating app for Super Smash Bros players says it received a cease and desist the day before entering its open beta stage.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In June 2024, a new app called &#8216;SmashTogether&#8217; was announced as the &#8220;premium dating site for Super <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/smash/">Smash</a> Bros enjoyers.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Screenshots of the app showed that users could list their tag, mains, ranking, ages, notable players they&#8217;ve beaten, and location.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Meet your dream Doubles partner (in and out of Smash) with our robust matchmaking algorithm, tailored to connect you with your ideal Smash Partner,&#8221; they app boasted.</p> 



 



<h2 id="h-smash-bros-dating-app-reportedly-hit-with-cease-&amp;-desist" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Smash Bros dating app reportedly hit with cease &amp; desist</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For nearly a year, players were left waiting for news on the app&#8217;s progress with many also <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/smash/super-smash-bros-players-baffled-by-viral-smashtogether-dating-app-but-is-it-real-2766758/">convinced it was merely a hoax</a>. However, on May 11, the account&#8217;s X page claimed it was ready to enter its open beta.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The app will be public on May 15th. Access is currently waitlist-only, but release-day spots can be reserved,&#8221; they said.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The next say, SmashTogether announced they&#8217;d received &#8220;unprecedented level of support&#8221; and had passed 400 pre-registrations.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Before SmashTogether could go live, however, the page updated fans by saying they had received a cease and desist letter.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Nintendo <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/smash/smash-fans-outraged-as-nintendo-shuts-down-big-house-with-cease-desist-1457908/">shutting down projects</a> like this isn&#8217;t out of the ordinary. Plus, competitive Smash Bros has a notorious history when it comes to sexual harassment and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/smash/multiple-smash-personalities-accused-of-sexual-assault-and-misconduct-1387512/">scandals plaguing the scene</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So far, SmashTogether has yet to provide any further updates or proof that they had been shut down by Nintendo, but fans weren&#8217;t surprised by this development.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Is it just Me or maybe creating a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/tinder-slammed-after-launching-499-subscription-tier-nobodys-buying-this-2437286/">Tinder</a>-like app using the Smash IP wasn&#8217;t a good idea in the 1st place? Did They really think N would let it slide?&#8221; one said.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Of course they did what did you expect was going to happen?&#8221; another chimed in.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;ll have to see what the next course of action for SmashTogether is or if this whole thing was just a big joke. In any case, don&#8217;t expect to see a dating app just for Smash players on the app store anytime soon.</p>
