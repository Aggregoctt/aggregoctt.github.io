Here&#8217;s everything we know about them. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The popular donut restaurant has partnered with quite a few different brands in the past, including some that went massively viral across social media. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">They&#8217;re not always available in the United States, however, like <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/food/krispy-kreme-launches-barbie-donuts-but-theres-a-catch-2885178/">Krispy Kreme&#8217;s UK-only Barbie donuts</a> back in September 2024 and its <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/food/krispy-kreme-releases-friends-themed-donuts-2781564/">collab with the TV show Friends</a> in June of that same year.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now, Krispy Kreme has partnered with Bandai Namco to release a lineup of unique Pac-Man-inspired donuts that fans can already buy.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The new donuts inspired by the retro video game became available on Monday, May 12, and will stay at Krispy Kreme until June 1, 2025.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to the website, you can buy each of the three donuts alone for $2.69 a piece, a three-pack for $7.49, or a special dozen bundle for $19.99. If you don&#8217;t have access to a Krispy Kreme store, they&#8217;re also releasing a six pack at Walmart, Kroger, Publix, and more. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Team Ghost donut features a line of ghost sprites going through a section of the Pac-Man screen, with four yellow pellets on the right side. All three are regular iced donuts on the outside, but this one is filled with chocolate-flavored Kreme. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Krispy Kreme&#8217;s Strawberry Power Berry donut pays homage to the game&#8217;s Power Berries, and features a strawberry Kreme just as the name implies.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The third one is called the Pac-Man Party donut and features yellow buttercream icing with sprinkles and a plastic character piece. </p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On top of the new donuts, Krispy Kreme is renaming its Doughnut Dots to &#8220;Pac-Dots&#8221; from May 12 to 14, and 10 of them are free with the purchase of a dozen regular donuts. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Between May 12 and May 18, the company is giving away 45,000 donuts for free between 7-9 am and 5-7 pm, or whenever your local store decides to turn on the &#8220;Hot Light.&#8221; </p>
