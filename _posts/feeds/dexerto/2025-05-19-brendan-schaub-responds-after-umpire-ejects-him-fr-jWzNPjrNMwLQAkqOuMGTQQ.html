<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Comedian and podcast host Brendan Schaub is getting roasted on social media after an umpire kicked him out of his son&#8217;s Little League baseball game over the weekend.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Brendan Schaub is a former <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/mma/">mixed martial artist</a>, stand-up comedian and the host of his own podcast, The Fighter and the Kid. He&#8217;s also a dad to two sons, one of which competes in Little League baseball.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Schaub has been open about how proud he is of his son&#8217;s performances, occasionally posting updates to platforms like <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> &#8212; but his involvement as a coach in one of his kid&#8217;s weekend games has sparked backlash against him.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over the weekend of May 17, Schaub attended one of his son&#8217;s games. Footage from the competition was posted online, showing a young player sliding into home base.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, the umpire determined that he wasn&#8217;t &#8216;safe,&#8217; much to the opposing team&#8217;s delight. Schaub, on the other hand, was irate, telling the ref that his call was &#8220;garbage.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Instantly, the ump ejected him from the game, using his entire body to make the call. Schaub seemed stunned, walking up to the referee to ask, &#8220;I got ejected for saying the call was garbage?&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;With that language, even more so,&#8221; the umpire can be heard saying &#8212; to which Schaub responded with, &#8220;Get the f**k outta here.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The moment went viral within the MMA community, sparking a wave of backlash against Schaub for his reaction to the ref&#8217;s call. For his part, Schaub has admitted that he takes his son&#8217;s sports very seriously, having spoken about it at length on his podcast.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Schaub reacted to the backlash in an Instagram post on May 18, seemingly unperturbed by the response online.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The kid was safe,&#8221; he wrote alongside a shrugging emoji. &#8220;Must be a slow-ass news day in MMA when this is a headline. Also, I was the third coach this ump threw out that day. Alllllllll I said was, &#8216;That&#8217;s a garbage call.&#8217; It&#8217;s the playoffs, for god sakes.&#8221;</p> 



 
 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Reactions have largely been angled against Schaub, with one user writing on YouTube, &#8220;He went on a podcast and called little children fat and idiots. Parents like that should be banned from attending games.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Schaub has made divisive remarks about other children in his son&#8217;s baseball league on his podcast, claiming that he told his son <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2RaB_4As1U&amp;t=201s&amp;pp=ygUoYnJlbmRhbiBzY2hhdWIgY2FsbGluZyBraWRzIGZhdCBiYXNlYmFsbA%3D%3D">in one episode</a>: &#8220;I go, &#8216;If this slow, fat kid gets a hit off you, this isn&#8217;t for you.'&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Dude is such a bully. He&#8217;s a huge fighter. Look how he was walking over to intimidate the ump,&#8221; another said.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, commenters on Schaub&#8217;s post are largely supportive, with one writing: &#8220;A guy can&#8217;t be passionate nowadays! Good work. Rather this than some Dad being on his phone the whole time not even knowing the score of his kid&#8217;s baseball game.&#8221;</p>
