<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over the last few years, content creators have taken to the world of boxing to try and settle their disputes. It has led to a massive explosion in influencer boxing events, with the likes of Jake Paul and KSI even taking part in several professional fights.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">KSI&#8217;s X series with DAZN has continued the influencer fights, with numerous YouTubers, TikTokers, and X posters getting into the ring. They&#8217;ve also come a long way from the usual amateur bouts with headguards and limited production, they are genuine big-time events now.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Adin Ross has started getting involved with his own events, Brand Risk. The KICK star promotes fights from his warehouse in Florida, and has <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/kick/adin-ross-locks-in-kick-return-teases-long-term-future-on-platform-3020486/">gotten the support of the Stake-backed platform too.&#160;</a></p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For his next event, the streaming star pitched an idea to DDG and Soulja Boy that they could meet in the Brand Risk ring after DDG called out the rapper.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;If you want to fight, set the motherf**king fight up,&#8221; the rapper said in response to DDG&#8217;s callout. Yet, he wasn&#8217;t best pleased with Adin&#8217;s offer of $75,000 for him to get into the ring, with a bonus of $100,000 for the winner.&#160;&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;75 bands? Cheap as hell! I need a million. Don&#8217;t even try me like that,&#8221; Soulja Boy told Adin. &#8220;What the f**k? If there ain&#8217;t a million in cash&#8230; get out of my phone. Tell DDG imma beat him up for free. When they get a million, minimum, then holla at me. 75 bands? I&#8217;ll go beat him up for nothing, if that&#8217;s the case.&#8221;</p>
