<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Newly-released GTA 6 screenshots are hinting at the return of a character from a forgotten Rockstar franchise.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rockstar Games shocked the world with the debut of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-trailer-2-blows-fans-away-with-insane-graphics-on-base-ps5-3190716/">GTA 6&#8217;s second trailer</a>, along with a series of screenshots, location details and character bios.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As expected, the internet has been hard at work picking apart every frame of the trailer, and they&#8217;ve already made some pretty <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-screenshot-has-gta-5-easter-egg-that-you-definitely-missed-3195935/">wild discoveries</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Interestingly, one character&#8217;s tattoos have fans extremely excited, because it appears that Piggsy from Manhunt will be making an appearance of some sort in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">VI</a>.</p> 



<h2 id="h-gta-6-screenshots-hint-at-piggsy&#8217;s-return-following-manhunt" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">GTA 6 screenshots hint at Piggsy&#8217;s return following Manhunt</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Piggsy was an antagonist from Rockstar&#8217;s extremely controversial psychological horror game Manhunt.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The game, which was banned in numerous countries, features a pig head-wearing cannibalistic mass murderer named Piggsy.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As noted by <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/">YouTube</a> channel GTA VI O&#8217;Clock, screenshots of the character Cal Hampton show that he has what appears to be a Piggsly tattoo on his right leg.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Hampton&#8217;s character bio reveals that he&#8217;s a conspiracy theorist who &#8220;snoops on Coast Guard comms with a few beers and some private browser tabs open.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, as GTA VI O&#8217;Clock <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/GTAVoclock/status/1922705401897988174">notes</a>: &#8220;The actual Piggsy from Manhunt is highly unlikely to appear in GTA 6, since Rockstar&#8217;s grisly action adventure was set in Carcer City in 2003, and he&#8217;d be less of a threat, having introduced his arms to a chainsaw and fallen into a very deep pit.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That said, Manhunt takes place in Carcer City and is technically part of the GTA <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/3D_Universe">3D Universe</a>. The 3D Universe spans numerous games, but doesn&#8217;t include <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-insider-doubles-down-on-gta-4-re-release-but-dont-get-too-excited-3195759/">GTA 4</a>, GTA 5, or GTA 6.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As such, it&#8217;s possible for Piggsy to still be alive in the world of GTA 6. There could even be a copycat killer. Or, you know, it could just be a neat reference/Easter Egg.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rockstar loves to include mysterious serial killer side missions in its games, such as Edmund Lowry Jr in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/red-dead-redemption/red-dead-redemption-2-is-getting-next-gen-upgrade-and-switch-2-port-report-3196721/">RDR2</a> or The Infinity Killer in GTA 5, so there&#8217;s a good chance we get something similar with VI.</p>
