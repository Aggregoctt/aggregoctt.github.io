<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">GTA 6 was delayed from Fall 2025 to May 2026 and the boss of Rockstar&#8217;s parent company has revealed why.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rockstar has always pushed the envelope with its games and GTA 6 won&#8217;t be any exception, as fans have been <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-trailer-2-blows-fans-away-with-insane-graphics-on-base-ps5-3190716/">blown away by the quality</a> shown in the second trailer.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While many were anxiously expecting the VI to release in Fall, the studio announced a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-officially-delayed-until-2026-3189190/">delay to May 2026</a>, confirming fans&#8217; worst nightmares.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has explained the exact reason for the delay and why Rockstar ultimately needed one.</p> 


 


<h2 id="h-gta-6-was-delayed-to-meet-rockstar&#8217;s-quest-for-&#8220;perfection&#8221;" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">GTA 6 was delayed to meet Rockstar&#8217;s quest for &#8220;perfection&#8221;</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-delays-pain-me-how-could-they-not-but-insists-gta-6s-new-2026-release-date-was-about-making-sure-rockstar-achieves-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations">IGN</a> ahead of Take-Two&#8217;s earnings call, Zelnick revealed that as Fall 2025 and GTA 6&#8217;s planned release window drew close, it became clear that more work was required.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;As we get closer to completion of a title that&#8217;s seeking perfection, the needs or lack thereof, for continued polish become clear,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure Rockstar Games achieves its creative vision with no limitations,&#8221; Zelnick claimed.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;And while of course, delays pain me &#8212; how could they not? &#8212; the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">During the earnings call, Take-Two&#8217;s CEO called the delay a &#8220;worthy investment,&#8221; adding that &#8220;the ambition and complexity of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-rumors-story-and-more-for-the-next-grand-theft-auto-game-245713/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is greater than any previous Rockstar title.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This lines up with leaks from a user who <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/leaker-proven-correct-about-gta-6-reveals-more-about-the-games-development-3194398/">shared accurate information about GTA 6</a> ahead of the second trailer about how devs felt a delay was &#8220;absolutely necessary.&#8221;</p>  


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;If we had gotten GTA 6 in 2025, it would have been a significantly worse game. They began cutting a lot of cool stuff to try and make that deadline,&#8221; X user GameRoll said.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As for the new release date, Zelnick is confident that it&#8217;ll be reached and players will have GTA 6 in their hands next year.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I think historically when we set a specific date, generally speaking, we&#8217;ve been very good about reaching it.&#8221;</p>
