<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s been eight years (bet you feel old now) since we were blessed with Injustice 2, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-ten-greatest-dc-video-games-of-all-time-2651109/">one of the best DC games ever</a>. Now, thanks to a subtle tease by a renowned dataminer, a third game could be on the horizon.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Produced by Warner Bros Games, Injustice is one of their most renowned franchises, standing alongside <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/reviews/back-4-blood-review-1672468/">Back 4 Blood</a>, and the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/kai-cenats-batman-arkham-marathon-stream-has-led-to-huge-video-game-sale-3141727/">Batman: Arkham series</a>. Just like Arkham, Injustice is a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-best-superhero-games-2510651/">superhero game</a>, letting you battle against Wonder Woman, Batman, Blue Beetle, Superman, and a plethora of different heroes.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Unfortunately, it&#8217;s been eight years since an Injustice game was released, with no word on whether we&#8217;d ever get a third. That was until a renowned dataminer <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/multiversus/multiversus-shuts-down-permanently-players-shouldnt-expect-refunds-3052677/">known for their reliable predictions</a> revealed a subtle hint about Injustice 3.</p>



<h2 id="h-injustice-3-could-be-coming-soon" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Injustice 3 could be coming soon</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The account MultiverserSusie on X is renowned for accurately revealing Warner Bros Games news before they&#8217;re fully announced. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/multiversusie/status/1923533288137724173">subtle post on X</a>, they explained, &#8220;MultiVersus shutting down is an injustice, then doing it all again is another injustice. Leaving me without any leaks is yet again another injustice.&#8221; Eagleyed fans were quick to spot the three mentions of Injustice and quickly began speculating.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On the surface, this can seem like some relatively loose speculation, but the hint was only strengthened by the account&#8217;s follow-up reply, which simply read &#8220;3.&#8221; Three mentions of Injustice can only mean one thing &#8212; they&#8217;re teasing the upcoming announcement of Injustice 3.</p>
