<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Streaming star Asmongold has explained why he won&#8217;t be using YouTube when he starts multi-streaming, as he looks to move somewhat away from Twitch.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For the past few years, more and more streamers have started multi-streaming across different platforms. Fortnite king Tyler &#8216;Ninja&#8217; Blevins<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/ninja-isnt-leaving-twitch-yet-1921084/"> was the first to really make the jump</a> successfully, streaming concurrently across Twitch, TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It is a path that a number of streamers have followed too, especially as the big exclusive contracts that platforms previously handed out have gone away.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/asmongold/">Asmongold</a> is the newest big star to follow suit, revealing that he&#8217;s getting tired of a sole reliance on Twitch and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/asmongold-calls-twitch-irrelevant-as-he-reveals-plans-to-multi-stream-3193258/">wants to start multi-streaming too.</a> However, if you want to find him on YouTube, that isn&#8217;t the going to be the case.</p>



<h2 id="h-asmongold-won&#8217;t-multi-stream-on-youtube" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Asmongold won&#8217;t multi-stream on YouTube</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">During his May 21 stream, the streaming star noted that he plans to start multi-streaming very soon. However, he won&#8217;t be going live on YouTube.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I&#8217;ll stream on other platforms but not on YouTube, just because of YouTube&#8217;s rules, they&#8217;ve got specific rules,&#8221; he said after one fan asked him to go live on the Google-owned platform. The specific rules in question? Likely to do with his reactionary content.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The former OTK member noted that he is going to put his plans into action before long. &#8220;Pretty soon here, I&#8217;m gonna let you know about multi-streaming, probably in the next week or so,&#8221; he added.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Despite believing Twitch is becoming &#8220;irrelevant,&#8221; Asmon won&#8217;t turn his back on the Amazon-owned platform. &#8220;If you like watching on Twitch, nothing will change for you. I will never go and be like &#8216;I&#8217;m going to go and sign a deal with another platform and only stream on there,&#8217;&#8221; he noted.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The streamer wouldn&#8217;t be against an exclusive stream or two if a platform paid for him to head to an event &#8211; such as a UFC fight night &#8211; but multi-streaming will be the way for him otherwise.</p>
