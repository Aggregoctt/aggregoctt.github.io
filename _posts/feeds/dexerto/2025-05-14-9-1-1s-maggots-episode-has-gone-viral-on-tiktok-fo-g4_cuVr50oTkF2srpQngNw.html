<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the last few days, you might have been innocently scrolling through <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tiktok/">TikTok</a> and found a maggot video that made you want to heave. It&#8217;s an old 9-1-1 episode that has gone viral, and for good reason.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you&#8217;re watching <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/911-season-8-details-2779272/">9-1-1 Season 8</a> as it airs on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/cbs-show-renewals-2025-2026-ghosts-georgie-mandy-fire-country-3139837/">CBS</a>, you&#8217;ll know the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-binge-worthy-shows-where-to-stream-2565318/">binge-worthy TV show</a> feels very different from any kind of maggotty horror. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/911-peter-krause-leaving-bobby-season-8-exit-explained-3181959/">Bobby (Peter Krause)</a> has just died in a devastating virus leak, with Station 118 struggling to keep it together during his funeral.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We know we&#8217;re on track for Season 9, but it doesn&#8217;t feel like the show can continue without its true station chief &#8211; even with Athena (Angela Bassett) front and center. But it didn&#8217;t always used to be so doom and gloom.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Before it was the station risking their lives, the most grisly storylines lay with the people they try to help on a daily basis. One, which involved a hefty amount of maggots, has gone viral on TikTok. Be warned &#8211; what you&#8217;re about to witness is absolutely gross. </p> 



<h2 id="h-9-1-1&#8217;s-maggots-in-hair-episode-went-viral-for-exactly-the-reason-you-think" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">9-1-1&#8217;s maggots in hair episode went viral for exactly the reason you think</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In 9-1-1 Season 5 Episode 18, titled &#8216;Starting Over,&#8217; a woman arrives at a hair salon complaining about hair extensions she&#8217;d had fitted some days before. She&#8217;s getting bad headaches and demands for them to be taken out.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When the hairdresser takes a look, she&#8217;s got a gnarly maggot infestation oozing out the back of her head &#8211; hence why it&#8217;s been nicknamed &#8216;9-1-1 maggot in hair episode.&#8217;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The emergency services are brought in because, clearly, this woman needs urgent medical attention. She&#8217;s got no idea what&#8217;s actually going on back there, which should be nigh-on impossible to actually happen. When Hen and the team arrive to answer some questions, we get the full story.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The hairdresser reveals he was the same guy who fitted the extensions, sourcing hair that essentially came from dead bodies when he ran into supply trouble. He believed they were legitimately fit for use, but, well, we can see how well that went.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Annoyingly, it&#8217;s a scene we quickly move on from. After the woman is treated, we move on to Tori and Clive&#8217;s wedding, alongside watching <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/does-chimey-die-911-season-8-kenneth-choi-leaving-3179087/">Chimey</a> get closer to Maddie and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/911-season-8-oliver-stark-buck-relationship-eddie-2987555/">Buck</a> breaking up with Taylor.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, it&#8217;s this scene fans have remembered, and you can watch the whole thing for free on TikTok.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This made my skin crawl,&#8221; one TikTok user replied, with a second weighing in, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t the people removing the maggots shut up?? They&#8217;re making the girl panic even more.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you&#8217;re lucky, you&#8217;ll find the full scene with the actual maggot infestation blurred out. If not &#8211; make sure you get some fresh air.</p>
