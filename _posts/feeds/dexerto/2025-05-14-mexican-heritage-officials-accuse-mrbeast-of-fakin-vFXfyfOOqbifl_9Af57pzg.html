<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After spending 100 hours in ancient Maya temples, MrBeast&#8217;s latest YouTube video has sparked backlash from Mexican officials. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 10, 2025, Jimmy &#8216;MrBeast&#8217; Donaldson uploaded a video where he explored ancient Maya temples in Mexico, and spent 100 hours inside them.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The 15-minute video has received 55 million views in the four days since it was uploaded. The video focuses on Donaldson and his team exploring several different Maya temples in Southern Mexico.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, Mexican officials have hit out against MrBeast&#8217;s video with claims that it &#8220;distorted information.&#8221; </p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Mexico&#8217;s National Institute of Anthropology and History <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.inah.gob.mx/boletines/la-visita-del-youtuber-mr-beast-a-sitios-patrimoniales-se-realizo-en-apego-a-la-normatividad-del-inah">issued a press release on Monday, May 12,</a> commenting on MrBeast&#8217;s visit to the ancient Maya temples. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In it, they confirm that the YouTubers&#8217; visit had the necessary permits and that the heritage of the sites was respected throughout the entire time he was there. However, they did share some corrections for the final version of the video that was uploaded. </p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;In the case of Chich&#233;n Itz&#225;, we clarify that there was no drone flight inside El Castillo, as falsely mentioned in the video; This flight was carried out outside the structure,&#8221; reads the press release. The INAH also mentioned that the video has &#8220;extensive audiovisual post-production work.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It should be noted that, evidently, the video has extensive audiovisual post-production work and alludes to events that did not occur, such as the fact that the producers never descended from a helicopter, nor spent the night inside the archaeological zone nor did they have in their possession any pre-Hispanic mask, since the one they present is clearly a contemporary reproduction,&#8221; they said. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;All of them are false assertions that obey the theatricality of the&#160;YouTuber&#160;in question.&#8221;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Despite the &#8220;distorted information&#8221; offered by MrBeast, the INAH says that his video can motivate the interest of younger people in Mexico and the world to learn about their ancestral cultures. </p>
