<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A new <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/palworld/">Palworld</a> mod has brought back the ability to glide with Pals, just two days after the devs were forced to remove it.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 8, Palworld devs revealed that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/palworld/palworld-forced-to-make-major-change-due-to-pokemon-nintendo-lawsuit-3192991/">players would no longer be able to glide with their Pals</a>. The removal of the feature stems from the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/palworld/full-palworld-lawsuit-timeline-nintendo-pokemons-beef-with-indie-hit-explained-2905353/">ongoing lawsuit</a> issued by Nintendo and The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/">Pokemon</a> Company, which believes Palworld infringes upon its intellectual property.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In fact, Palworld was famously forced to remove the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pal Spheres back in November 2024.  However, the May 8 removal of the game&#8217;s Pal flying mechanic has left many fans disappointed. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Well, just two days after Palword&#8217;s v0.5.5 patch removed the feature, a mod has brought it back to its former glory.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-palworld-mod-brings-back-pal-gliding" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Palworld mod brings back Pal gliding</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Posting on the mod sharing website, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/2454">Nexus Mods</a>, a Palworld player has uploaded a file that reverses the v0.5.5 patch. By downloading the Glider Restoration mod, players can once again use their Pals to fly around the map.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The mod&#8217;s creator notes that players still need a Glider in their inventory, and that it&#8217;s &#8220;not quite perfect,&#8221; but it does bring back this beloved feature. Interestingly, the description states that you can use the mod in multiplayer sessions, but other players who don&#8217;t have the mod installed will just see regular gliders.&#160;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The mod page also says that Glider Restoration is compatible with other mods, but there could be issues with files that change the models of glider Pals. It&#8217;s best to uninstall the latter if you wish to avoid any odd textures and bugs.&#160;</p>
