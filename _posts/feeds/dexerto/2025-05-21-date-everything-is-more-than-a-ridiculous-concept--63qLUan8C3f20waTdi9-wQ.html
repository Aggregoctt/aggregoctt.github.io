<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/date-everything-what-we-know-2839609/">Date Everything</a>, you (literally) date everything. You&#8217;re given glasses that turn your everyday items into people, and naturally, you can fall in love with them or make enemies depending on your choices. However, despite the wild premise, there&#8217;s so much more to the adventure.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The idea that you can fall in love with your toaster or your toilet (shoutout to Jean Loo Pissoir, AKA Lil&#8217; Crapper) is a ridiculous idea, but one that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/date-everything-lets-you-literally-romance-furniture-and-its-actually-great-3177869/">intrigued me when I first played Date Everything</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Given that the devs, Sassy Chap Games, were built by talented voice actors, the roster of dateables is filled with recognisable (and new) talent, from Matt Mercer, their very own Robbie Daymond, Ray Chase, Ben Starr, Laura Bailey, and other well-known voices.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, once you put all that aside and dive into the game, you&#8217;ll find it&#8217;s so much more than its crazy concept, and it was all intentional.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In an interview with Date Everything&#8217;s creators, Dexerto sat down with co-creator Robbie Daymond, Game Developer and Lead Writer Ray Chase, and Producer, Writer, Director, and voice of Rebel (the rubber duck), Amanda Hufford, to talk about just what makes Date Everything more heart than concept.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Essentially, Date Everything is &#8220;a ridiculous concept executed at a high level,&#8221; explained Robbie Daymond, who goes on to share: &#8220;I think we struck a good balance of like, saucy and naughty, but not explicit, not crazy, and not too scary.&#8221;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The adventure is still a dating sim, but it manages to focus on the heart of the story rather than making the entire premise trying to get with your fruit bowl.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He continued, acknowledging the rather strange concept: &#8220;We think that this is a game that&#8217;s going to attract a lot of attention from people just out of curiosity, but we also don&#8217;t want to make everybody run away screaming, and crying, so I think we we struck a good balance.&#8221;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, while there is a pretty &#8220;ridiculous concept,&#8221; Sassy Chap Games has focused on pouring touching moments into the dating sim, aiming to &#8220;subvert the expectations of satire and make something that fits right in the pocket.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As you develop relationships with the game&#8217;s dateables, you&#8217;ll uncover deeper and more meaningful interactions with various good and bad endings. While the furniture may be dateable and filled with punny names, don&#8217;t let it fool you, this is still the kind of adventure to tug on your heart strings in more than one way.</p>
