On top of this was the general love for the new game&#8217;s graphics, which had come a long way since the first trailer.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, that&#8217;s a year away, and one mod has just dropped that promises to give you GTA 6-style graphics in GTA 5, with beautiful waters, ray tracing, lighting, and stunning reflections.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Known as NaturalVision Enchanced and created by Razed, this mod has completely overhauled the visual style of GTA 5, making it more vibrant and up to date for 2025&#8217;s graphics. Their trailer showcases stunning reflections, incredible details, realistic water, and an upgrade to the PC&#8217;s and NPCs&#8217; overall designs.</p>
