<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/avengers-the-kang-dynasty-release-date-cast-plot-more-1949725/">Avengers: Doomsday</a> and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/avengers-secret-wars-release-date-cast-plot-more-1950442/">Secret Wars</a> have been delayed, but that&#8217;s not the only shake-up on Marvel&#8217;s theatrical calendar: three movies have been removed altogether.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When Kevin Feige initially unveiled Phase Six at SDCC in 2022, there were two big differences. Firstly, Doomsday was titled Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, set to revolve around Jonathan Majors&#8217; titular (and since axed) villain. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Secondly, both movies were given ambitious release dates: May 1 and November 7 in 2025. Straight away, industry experts and fans alike were sceptical, and as many predicted, they&#8217;ve been pushed back multiple times. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/avengers-doomsday-delay-marvel-question-about-spider-man-4-3198666/">Doomsday will be released on December 18, 2026,</a> while Secret Wars will hit cinemas on December 17, 2027. The question is, what else is in the works?</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Three untitled Marvel movies have been removed from Disney&#8217;s slate, as per <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://x.com/ERCboxoffice/status/1925719706289250815">Exhibitor Relations Co</a>. They were listed for release on the following dates:</p>



<ul class="pl-10 mt-1 overflow-y-hidden font-body text-body-1 text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white dark:text-body-1 dark:font-body mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text List_list___uTwY wp-block-list">
<li>February 2, 2026</li>



<li>November 6, 2026</li>



<li>November 5, 2027</li>
</ul>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That means there are only four Marvel movies with confirmed release dates between now and the end of 2027 (<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/fantastic-four-mcu-release-date-trailer-cast-plot-more-1873098/">Fantastic Four</a> drops on July 25 this year and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/spider-man-4-everything-we-know-2006937/">Spider-Man: Brand New Day</a> will be released on July 31, 2026).</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s a sparse schedule, especially after the franchise&#8217;s ramped-up output in the 2020s with Disney shows and films (there have been 14 films since Endgame). This also comes after Bob Iger announced a revised output plan for Marvel, with the studio now aiming for a maximum of three movies, two live-action shows, and two animated shows a year. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Overall, I feel great about the slate. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve committed to spending more and more time on. The team is one that I have tremendous confidence in and the IP that we&#8217;re mining, including all the sequels that we&#8217;re doing, is second to none,&#8221; the Disney CEO said (via <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/marvel-tv-shows-movies-reduced-bob-iger-disney-1235994149/">Variety</a>). </p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, what were these unannounced titles? Could it be that they were earmarked for Armor Wars, Black Panther 3, or perhaps even Mahershala Ali&#8217;s long-developed and little-filmed <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/blade-mcu-release-date-trailer-cast-plot-more-1873763/">Blade movie</a>?</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, here&#8217;s something to bear in mind: there have been a lot of rumors about Marvel going big at this year&#8217;s Comic-Con, so they may have been removed so Feige can announce fresh dates in the coming months. </p>
