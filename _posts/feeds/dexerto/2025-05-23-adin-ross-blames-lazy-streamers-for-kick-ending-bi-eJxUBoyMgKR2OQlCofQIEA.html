<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Adin Ross has blamed &#8220;lazy&#8221; streamers for Kick moving away from handing out big-money deals to new signees.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As new streaming platforms have launched to go up against Twitch, they&#8217;ve splashed the cash on big names. Mixer paid Ninja and Shroud big money to move away from the Amazon-owned platform, for a while anyway, before things went belly up.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In its early days, Kick followed that path. They signed Adin Ross, xQc, and Amouranth on reported massive deals. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/exclusive-xqcs-agency-reveals-how-streaming-giant-landed-100m-kick-deals-price-tag-2441594/">xQc&#8217;s deal was reported to be worth around $100 million</a>, and that he would still have the option to stream on Twitch every day too.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While they have launched more incentives for streamers to make the switch, including paying out to multi-streamers, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/kick/kick-co-founder-claims-dr-disrespect-streaming-deal-would-be-waste-of-money-2936594/">the Stake-backed platform has stopped giving out those big exclusive deals.&#160;</a></p>



<h2 id="h-adin-ross-blames-brucedropemoff-for-kick&#8217;s-end-to-big-deals" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Adin Ross blames BruceDropEmOff for Kick&#8217;s end to big deals</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Adin Ross has pointed the finger at &#8220;lazy&#8221; streamers for that, namedropping BruceDropEmOff in the process.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Here&#8217;s the problem, they can&#8217;t give these people these deals anymore because they take these deals and they get lazy and they stop doing the content,&#8221; <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://kick.com/adinross/clips/clip_01JVTPJ42MYWCE4X41EH8MP5GX">Adin said</a> when Sneako questioned him on whether or not the platform would sign SoLLUMINATI.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I have nothing but love and respect for him, but Bruce. I love Bruce and I think hes an amazing streamer, but when he went to Kick he was watching movies, doing streams with no face cam. I was doing lazy streams too, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but you got to actually try on Kick.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Bruce has teased making a return to streaming in the near future. However, he also noted he&#8217;s picked out dates for his return, got there, and then passed on them.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Adin has also already welcomed SoLLUMINATI to Kick <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/solluminati-unbanned-on-twitch-as-he-wants-kick-deal-instead-3198283/">after the streamer received his second ban from Twitch in under a month.&#160;</a></p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;SoLLUMINATI is going to come to Kick. It is happening. It is happening sooner than we all think,&#8221; he confirmed.</p>
