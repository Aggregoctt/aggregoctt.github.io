<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/stellar-blade/">Stellar Blade</a> was set to escape console exclusivity with a bang, but now, it&#8217;s blocked in 129 countries.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The slick sci-fi action-RPG has enjoyed a glow-up since launch. Critics praised its fast-paced combat and jaw-dropping visuals. On May 15, developer Shift Up announced a PC port will release on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/stellar-blade/stellar-blade-on-pc-2978505/">June 11</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It should have been a win for everyone. Instead, shortly after the update announcement, PC players from 129 countries suddenly couldn&#8217;t access the game&#8217;s store page.</p> 



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade&#8217;s-pc-launch-is-out-of-reach-for-players-in-these-129-countries" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Stellar Blade&#8217;s PC launch is out of reach for players in these 129 countries</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When several players who live in certain countries tried to open the Steam Store&#8217;s page for Stellar Blade to pre-order the game, they were met with an error that read, &#8220;This item is not available in your region.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The block included <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrAS88iX0AAHzj5?format=png&amp;name=900x900">countries with no active PlayStation Network support</a>, like Egypt, Iraq, and Venezuela.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Shift Up apparently didn&#8217;t see this coming either.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One heartbroken fan posted, &#8220;Are you kidding me? I&#8217;ve been waiting for you for a year&#8230; and now it&#8217;s banned in my country because there is no PSN. What is this nonsense?&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Stellar Blade&#8217;s support team tried to help. &#8220;The PC version&#8230; does not require a PSN account. May I ask where you live?&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Players weren&#8217;t having it. &#8220;Seriously Sony? Seriously?&#8221; became a chorus. The frustration makes sense. Sony recently tried forcing <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/helldivers/helldivers-2-pc-players-required-to-have-active-playstation-account-to-continue-playing-2676641/">PSN logins for Helldivers 2</a> on PC until backlash made them backpedal fast.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Here&#8217;s a full list of every country that can&#8217;t access Stellar Blade on PC:</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While fans fear Stellar Blade may be caught in the same trap, neither Sony or Shift Up have made an official announcement to clear up the situation yet.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For now, Stellar Blade&#8217;s PC launch has hit a wall. Shift Up still plans to break it down before the June release. Let&#8217;s hope they do, because at this point, the only thing more dangerous than Stellar Blade&#8217;s enemies&#8230; is its distribution strategy.</p>
