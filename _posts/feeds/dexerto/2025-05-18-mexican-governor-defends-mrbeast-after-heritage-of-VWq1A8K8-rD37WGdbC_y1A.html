<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">MrBeast is under threat of lawsuit by Mexico&#8217;s National Institute of Anthropology and History, but he&#8217;s claimed that he isn&#8217;t being sued and that the governor of the state he filmed in coming to his defense.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">They took issue with his editing style and the fact that he tried to play up the story of these historical Mayan sites, claiming that the way in which his videos were styled was an <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/mexican-heritage-officials-accuse-mrbeast-of-faking-parts-of-maya-temples-video-3195530/">inaccurate portrayal of their culture</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Not only does he claim that he worked with local archeologists and officials to ensure historical accuracy in the video, he also had the governor of the state he filmed in back him up.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Campeche Governor Sansores fired back, defending MrBeast and explaining that, if their cultural ministry has any issues with his video, they should take it up with her.</p>



<h2 id="h-mrbeast-reveals-he&#8217;s-funding-the-very-organization-that-wants-to-sue" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">MrBeast reveals he&#8217;s funding the very organization that wants to sue</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">MrBeast&#8217;s video included ads for his products, something the INAH (National Institute of Anthropology and History) took issue with, to the point where they threatened to sue the media company that represents him over it.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The INAH has filed an administrative lawsuit against the production company, demanding compensation for damages and a public retraction for failure to comply with the terms of the permits issued in good faith by the institution and for making illicit use, for private profit, of the archaeological heritage that belongs to all Mexicans,&#8221; the Institute explained <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/INAHmx/status/1922873346854674520">in a tweet thread</a>.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The YouTuber claimed that he filmed the video with respect for local archaeologists, culture, the proper permits, and permission from government agencies.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We are not and have never been sued by them lol. That is false and it saddens me to see people spreading lies.&#8221; </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This is strange considering the official INAH account tweeted that they&#8217;re suing his production company. Nonetheless, MrBeast claims his innocence in the matter.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We filmed with full permits, followed guidelines, had representatives from government agencies following us, Mexican archeologists to make sure we were accurate, AND representatives from the sites to ensure we were following the rules,&#8221; <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/MrBeast/status/1924158489716219931">he explained.</a></p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He also filmed any and all advertisements included the video away from cultural sites, which is the main sticking point that the INAH claimed to want to sue his production company over.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Additionally, governor Layda Sansores vouched for MrBeast, fighting back against accusations from Mexico&#8217;s Secretary of Culture and defending the YouTuber.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We are deeply grateful to MrBeast for visiting Calakmul and sharing the grandeur of our Mayan culture with the world. His presence brought a direct economic boost to local communities and greatly contributed to the global promotion of our tourism. He did not charge a single peso for this initiative.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;MrBeast&#8217;s team acted at all times with utmost responsibility and respect toward our ancestral heritage. All necessary permits and legal procedures were duly processed and authorized by [the INAH], who were present during the filming, alongside [Campeche&#8217;s Ministry of Tourism] and the Government of Campeche.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;If there are any concerns from [Mexico&#8217;s Secretary of Culture], we respectfully ask that they be addressed to the Government of Campeche, as we take full responsibility for promoting the cultural and natural richness that defines us,&#8221; she <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/LaydaSansores/status/1922781648086499595">said in an official statement</a>.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Additionally, MrBeast revealed that he was funding Mexico&#8217;s National Institute of Anthropology and History, the very organization that called him out after the video was filmed.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I&#8217;ve also been working with INAH on a fund to support local Mexican archeology and new discoveries because I wanted to help spread the culture as a thanks for allowing us to film. I hope to go back someday and continue to share how awesome the culture is with the world, sad to see this get distorted,&#8221; MrBeast concluded.</p>
