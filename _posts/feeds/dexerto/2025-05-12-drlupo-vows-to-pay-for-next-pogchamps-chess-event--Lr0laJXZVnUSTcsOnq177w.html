<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Popular Twitch streamer DrLupo says he&#8217;s willing to pay for the next PogChamps tournament after admitting to cheating in one of the chess series&#8217; online competitions.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In April 2025, Benjamin &#8216;DrLupo&#8217; Lupo competed in a $100K PogChamps chess event and bested a much higher rated player, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/">YouTuber</a> Wolfe &#8216;Wolfey&#8217; Glick.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fans were baffled by this outcome given the difference in skill level, as Lupo had a rating of 650 while Wolfey was 1340. Furthermore, Lupo made a series of highly advanced moves, which swiftly led to cheating accusations against the streamer.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Chess.com, the organizer of the event, was quick to ban Lupo&#8217;s account and remove him from the tournament for a &#8220;fair play violation.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While DrLupo originally denied having cheated, he later claimed that he had been reading comments from his chat to get ideas for moves &#8211; and later finally <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/drlupo-removed-from-100k-pogchamps-chess-tournament-for-cheating-3188473/">confessed to using an engine</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now, weeks after the cheating drama took over social media, Lupo went live on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/">Twitch</a> and YouTube to explain how he&#8217;ll be punishing himself for the controversy.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to the streamer, he was <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/asmongold-demands-twitch-ban-drlupo-after-pogchamps-chess-cheating-controversy-3188965/">surprised that Twitch didn&#8217;t ban him</a> for cheating, as it&#8217;s a violation of their policies.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;They didn&#8217;t ban me. I don&#8217;t know why they didn&#8217;t ban me. But I took the time off, because I was like, &#8216;There probably should be ramifications for this.&#8217; None of my long-term sponsors have backed out, which I&#8217;m thankful for, because I think they&#8217;re giving me an opportunity to prove that I&#8217;m taking this seriously,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Lupo further stated that, outside of his chess account being banned, there weren&#8217;t any further consequences &#8211; but he believes he should still pay a steep price for cheating.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I&#8217;ll gladly pay for the entirety of PogChamps 7. If they will let me. I&#8217;ll do the $100,000 charity, I&#8217;ll pay for the production costs, the graphic design, the prize pool for people, the salary for commentators. I&#8217;ll pay for everything. Send me the bill and I&#8217;ll pay for it.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Lupo believes the total cost of the event will come to around $250,000, but says that if Chess.com doesn&#8217;t want to associate with him, he&#8217;s also looking into reputable <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/chess/">chess</a> charities to which he can donate.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I owe the community of people that I joined and then, without realizing it, because I didn&#8217;t think about the consequences, attempted to defraud. And I&#8217;m sincerely sorry for that. I&#8217;m sorry that I let the addiction take over and screw this up.&#8221;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Earlier in the broadcast, Lupo compared himself to an addict seeking a dopamine hit in the form of approval and validation from others after a conversation with his therapist.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;What you saw was a person getting their drug fix,&#8221; he said in reference to his chat cheering him on after he won the controversial chess match.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Lupo ended his short stream promising to fix things and take responsibility, but would return to a more regular broadcast schedule shortly.</p>
