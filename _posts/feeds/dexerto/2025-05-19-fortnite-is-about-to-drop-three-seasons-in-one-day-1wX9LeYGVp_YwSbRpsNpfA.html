<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> is about to blast players with a content tsunami by releasing three new seasons in one massive update day.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fortnite isn&#8217;t just a game anymore, it&#8217;s a gaming theme park. Since 2017, it has ballooned into a buffet of modes. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite-battle-royale/">Battle Royale</a> is still the headliner, but players can also hop into <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/lego-fortnite/">LEGO Fortnite</a>, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/rocket-racing/">Rocket Racing</a>, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/fortnite-creative/">Creative</a>, or <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/fortnite-festival/">Fortnite Festival</a>. Each one scratches a different itch, from PvE hoarding to kart-racing chaos to musical jam sessions.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Epic usually staggers its seasonal updates like a reasonable developer. That way, Fortnite always feels &#8220;alive,&#8221; without melting the servers or players&#8217; brains. Until now.</p>


 


<h2 id="h-fortnite&#8217;s-doing-the-most-by-dropping-three-seasons-on-june-8" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Fortnite&#8217;s doing the most by dropping three seasons on June 8</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On June 8, Epic&#8217;s torching the rulebook. LEGO Fortnite, Fortnite OG, and Battle Royale are all getting new seasons. At once. No chill.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">LEGO Fortnite&#8217;s up first, riding the lightsaber glow from its <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/full-star-wars-update-schedule-in-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-3186591/">Star Wars event</a>, which wraps June 7. Summer 2025 LEGO sets are dropping too, including Mecha Team Leader and Captain Phasma. You can expect tie-in skins, a continued survival grind, and premium LEGO Pass goodies.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fortnite OG, the nostalgia machine, is returning with Season 4. That means classic chaos, Tilted Towers, pump shotguns, and maybe some map cycling back to 2018 greatness. If it ain&#8217;t broke, let Epic repackage it and make you miss it again.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Battle Royale is also getting a refresh. The current Star Wars-themed Galactic Battle season ends June 7, and while Epic is tight-lipped, leakers have found evidence that hints at a superhero season. That means both Fortnite OG and Fortnite Battle Royale will feature superhero seasons at the same time.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Launching three seasons together means maximum buzz, maximum chaos, and maximum player retention. Each mode stays distinct, but they&#8217;re all connected, same engine, shared rewards, overlapping cosmetics.</p>
