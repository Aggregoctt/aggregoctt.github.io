<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A new <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/battlefield/">Battlefield</a> game is on the way, and the devs have revealed that the campaign draws heavily from the 2024 movie Civil War, and even the Dead Space remake. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After a rocky few years, hype around the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/battlefield/next-battlefield-game-2900980/">next entry in the Battlefield series</a> is growing. The follow-up to 2042 is currently being playtested through Battlefield Labs, and the multiplayer footage that has emerged has fans excited to say the least.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But online is only half the package, as the game will also come with one of the series&#8217; signature explosive campaigns, and EA Motive is drawing from some unexpected places when looking for inspiration. </p> 



<h2 id="h-battlefield-devs-reveal-inspirations-for-new-campaign-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Battlefield devs reveal inspirations for new campaign </h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In an interview with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/next-battlefield-game-campaign-alex-garland-civil-war-inspired">Inverse</a>, senior producer Philippe Ducharme mentioned Civil War as a point of reference. The 2024 movie starring Kirsten Dunst followed a group of journalists travelling across a war-torn United States that had been torn apart by conflict.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I really enjoyed&#160;Civil War,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Some of the things that we&#8217;re pushing, the film is actually a good reference.&#8221; </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The elements we&#8217;re really interested in is the concept of talented but ordinary people put in extraordinary situations,&#8221; added creative director Roman Campos-Oriola. &#8220;That creates a very interesting dynamic in terms of relationships with other people. These are elements we&#8217;re looking to capture in the single player.&#8221; </p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">EA Motive were also behind the critically acclaimed Dead Space remake from 2023, a project that the devs said allowed them to highlight the &#8220;quirks and strengths&#8221; the team has. Although sci-fi horror is light years away from a military FPS, there are some inspirations making their way into &#8216;Battlefield 6.&#8217;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;On&#160;Dead Space, we talked a lot about the curve of tension. How to go from beat to beat, having the highs and the lows to keep players hooked, and even play with their expectations a little bit,&#8221; said Ducharme.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It&#8217;s obviously very different in a game like Battlefield. But we still brought that mentality over.&#8221;</p>
