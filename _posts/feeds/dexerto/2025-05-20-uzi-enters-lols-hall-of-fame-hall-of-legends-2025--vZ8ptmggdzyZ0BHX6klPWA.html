<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The second annual Hall of Legends inductee is coming for League of Legends, putting them in their esports Hall of Fame forever and giving the selected player their very own skins.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Faker was a pretty obvious choice for the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/faker-announced-as-first-inductee-into-lol-esports-hall-of-legends-2735961/">first Hall of Legends inductee</a> considering the longevity of his career and a massively stacked trophy cabinet. His act was going to be a tough one to follow.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The person that Riot ultimately chose was picked based not on the amount of Worlds titles he has, but the longevity of his career and his sheer level of individual skill: Uzi, the ADC player who dominated China for years.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Here&#8217;s everything we know about 2025&#8217;s Hall of Legends, including a bit more about who Uzi is, the sort of skins you can expect, when they&#8217;ll be coming to League of Legends and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-2025-hall-of-legends-event?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">When is the 2025 Hall of Legends event?</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/LeagueOfLeaks/status/1924485322638839808">Leaks have revealed</a> that Uzi&#8217;s Hall of Legends in-game event will be coming on patch 25.12, June 11. It isn&#8217;t yet known how long the event will be or how long players will have to grab in-game goodies.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Meanwhile, Uzi&#8217;s ceremony will happen on June 6, making his induction official and etching his name in the annals of League of Legends history permanently.</p> 



<h2 id="h-who-is-uzi?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Who is Uzi?</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Uzi is one of the best ADC players of all time. The fact that he never won a world championship and still managed to become the second Hall of Legends inductee speaks volumes for just how skilled this player was in his heyday.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He played in his very first world final in 2013 and was the best ADC in China for years coming close to glory in 2014 when he lost to a Faker-led T1. But he didn&#8217;t let those failures stop him from achieving greatness.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">RNG&#8217;s best roster was built around his success, and his 2018 MSI win with the org was a triumphant win that proved China can go toe-to-toe with South Korea on the international stage.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Uzi retired from pro play due to several health issues, came back to play a few matches on BLG in 2022, went back into free agency, returned again to play a season with EDG before calling it quits for good.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He&#8217;s a player known for mobile ADCs like Vayne and Ezreal, opting to play hard-carry, mechanically involved ADCs who are capable of putting the game on their back and outplaying their opponent. If Uzi was on a team, he expected everyone on the roster to work toward keeping him alive and enabling him to carry.</p> 



<h2 id="h-which-skins-will-uzi-get-for-the-hall-of-legends?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Which skins will Uzi get for the Hall of Legends?</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At the time of writing, Riot hasn&#8217;t officially revealed which skins will be coming as part of this event. However, according to leaks, we know which two champions will be getting skins.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The first pick is a little obvious: Vayne.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Vayne is Uzi&#8217;s signature champion. When he was featured in the Worlds 2018 trailer, that&#8217;s the champion they chose to embody him. Regardless of meta, Uzi rarely played ADCs that didn&#8217;t have some form of mobility or high outplay potential. That&#8217;s the epitome of what Vayne&#8217;s all about, getting into teamfights and dodging everything while shredding whatever stood in her way.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The second pick is a bit more modern: Kai&#8217;Sa.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Though it&#8217;s not the champion he was known for in his glory days, Kai&#8217;Sa defined a large swathe of Uzi&#8217;s later career. That may be in part because she does a lot of what Vayne does but a whole lot better in most cases. She&#8217;s also one of the most popular ADC champions in the game and, if you&#8217;re trying to sell skins, she&#8217;s a solid choice.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to leaks, Vayne will be the side skin and Kai&#8217;Sa will be the main event, akin to how LeBlanc was the side skin for Faker&#8217;s Hall of Legends bundle while Ahri was the one that came with all the extra goodies.</p>
