<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With the Season 4 finale ending on Starz tonight, there&#8217;s some bad news served as a side dish with <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/power-book-3-raising-kanan-season-4-episode-10-release-date-3193583/">Raising Kanan</a> Season 5. It&#8217;s coming, though, with a familiar <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/spider-man/">Spider-Man</a> face attached.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So far, the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-binge-worthy-shows-where-to-stream-2565318/">binge-worthy TV show</a> is on the cusp of introducing one of the most important Power characters never seen: Breeze. He&#8217;s a drug kingpin from Queens and is only ever mentioned in Power rather than fully explored.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, it&#8217;s a known fact that he employed Kanan at some point down the line, and that means if we do see him in tonight&#8217;s finale, he&#8217;ll be leading the charge in Season 5.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s a new star on the block arriving just in time to play him in Raising Kanan Season 5, but there&#8217;s also some unforeseen bad news.</p>



<h2 id="h-raising-kanan-season-5-will-be-the-last-as-shameik-moore-joins-cast" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Raising Kanan Season 5 will be the last as Shameik Moore joins cast</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Spider-Man star Shameik Moore is officially set to join the cast of Raising Kanan Season 5, but it&#8217;s also been revealed the fifth installment will also be the last. </p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Moore is expected to appear in tonight&#8217;s Season 4 finale as Branford &#8220;Breeze&#8221; Frady, with Moore confirming it himself in a press statement before the episode even airs.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The Power Universe fans have been patiently anticipating this moment, and I&#8217;m honored to step into the iconic role of Breeze,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I jumped into a story that is already alive with such strong characters, but it was a fun challenge to find Breeze&#8217;s unique identity, and I can&#8217;t wait for fans to see how Breeze will shift dynamics in the story. It&#8217;s gonna be a wild ride.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While fans might not expect the news that Season 5 is the end of the road, it&#8217;s something writers have been planning ahead for.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It was always my intention that Raising Kanan would run for five seasons, and thanks to my friends and partners at Starz and Lionsgate, as well as the incredible cast, crew and writing staff, I&#8217;ve been able to tell the entirety of the story I set out to tell way back in 2019,&#8221; said series showrunner Sascha Penn.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Having said that, with the table we&#8217;ve set in this season finale and the inevitable introduction of Breeze, there is still an exceptionally intense and action-packed season left for the viewers to experience, and I assure you that the stakes for Kanan and the entire Thomas family have never been higher. I&#8217;m very proud of this series, and grateful that we&#8217;ve been able to see it through to what is an incredibly explosive and satisfying conclusion for the unbelievably loyal fans of the Power Universe.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s even more bad news &#8211; all of the spinoff shows that came after 2014&#8217;s Power are either ending or have already ended. Power Book II: Ghost ended last year, while after four seasons, while Power Book IV: Force is developing its fourth and final season. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Thankfully Starz will be developing Power: Origins, which is a Ghost &amp; Tommy prequel series.</p>
