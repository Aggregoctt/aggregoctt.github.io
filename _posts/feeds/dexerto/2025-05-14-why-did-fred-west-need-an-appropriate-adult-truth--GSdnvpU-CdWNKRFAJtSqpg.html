<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/netflix-announce-new-true-crime-documentary-fred-rose-west-3180585/">Fred and Rose West: A British Horror Story</a> has landed on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a>, featuring previously unseen interviews from those involved in the notorious true crime case, including Janet Leach &#8211; the appropriate adult and eventual confidant of Fred West.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/new-documentaries-true-crime-netflix-hulu-prime-streaming-2271621/">new documentary</a> series tells the story of the UK&#8217;s worst serial killer couple. Between them, Fred and Rose West murdered at least 12 young women &#8211; including their daughter Heather and Fred&#8217;s daughter Charmaine &#8211;&#160;over the course of two decades.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">They famously dismembered the bodies and hid them in the cellar or under the patio of their &#8220;house of horrors&#8221; Gloucestershire home. Many of the Wests&#8217; children ended up in care, where police were alerted to the rumor Heather was buried in the garden.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Finally, in February 1994, Fred and Rose&#8217;s horrifying reign came to an end when the authorities excavated their garden. As is explored in the new <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/shocking-netflix-documentaries-2890798/">Netflix docu-series</a>, Fred was immediately taken into police custody, where he was introduced to an appropriate adult.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-why-did-fred-west-need-an-appropriate-adult?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Why did Fred West need an appropriate adult?</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Janet Leach was called in by Gloucestershire police to serve as Fred&#8217;s appropriate adult due to his learning difficulties and inability to read or write. This, coupled with the severity of his crimes, meant police were unable to interrogate him alone.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">You may recognize the term from <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/adolescence-true-story-netflix-drama-explained-3160830/">Netflix&#8217;s Adolescence</a>, which saw <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/why-jamie-killed-katie-in-netflix-adolescence-psychologist-3163553/">Jamie Miller</a> choose his father Eddie to serve as his appropriate adult. But in this instance, it&#8217;s because he&#8217;s a minor.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">An appropriate adult in the UK is either a parent, guardian, social worker, or a responsible individual over the age of 18 who is there to safeguard the interests, rights, entitlements, and welfare of children and vulnerable people suspected of a criminal offense.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The senior investigator in the Fred West case, Ben Bennet, wanted to ensure there was no doubt that Fred comprehended everything during the investigation, and so they called in Janet.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Despite the fact that she was working towards a social work diploma, she wasn&#8217;t prepared for what she was about to hear &#8211; especially as this was her first case.&#160;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In archive footage shown in Fred and Rose West: A British Horror Story, Janet explains, &#8220;I was working towards my diploma in social work, and I&#8217;d approached the Homeless Project in the view of becoming an appropriate adult.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;When someone gets in trouble with the police, we&#8217;d go down to the police station just to make sure that their needs were being met and they were being properly looked after.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I&#8217;d just finished college, and the phone was ringing when I came through the door. It was the Homeless Project asking could I go out to Gloucestershire police station.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Janet was taken into the custody suite, introduced to Fred West, and they went into the interview room, unaware of what was to come. During that interrogation, Fred admitted to killing his daughter and dismembering her in chilling detail.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I think I was just in a state of shock,&#8221; says Janet. &#8220;I just thought, you know, &#8216;What on earth are you actually doing here?&#8217;&#8230; but he sort of said to me afterwards, &#8216;Would you come again tomorrow?&#8217;&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The police reiterated the question, and so she agreed. &#8220;I should have really said no,&#8221; she adds.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Janet recalls a moment during the investigation where Fred was directing officers to another buried body beneath his patio, but it was his behavior that left her unsettled.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;He just kept looking at me and winking, as if it was some sort of game,&#8221; she continues. &#8220;When we got back, I asked him, &#8216;What did you mean? What was you looking at me like that for?&#8217; And he said, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you see the bone sticking out?&#8230; It&#8217;s just by the back door.&#8217;&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Even though Janet was shocked, Fred trusted her and treated her like a confidant. So much so that she was a star witness in Rose West&#8217;s trial &#8211; until a scandal changed everything.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-janet-leach-controversy-explained" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Janet Leach controversy explained</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Janet Leach was set to share testimony as the prosecution&#8217;s key witness, but her credibility was compromised when it was revealed during evidence that <strong>she had broken the confidentiality agreement and sold her story to the Daily Mirror newspaper</strong>.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The truth is that Fred and Rose West committed heinous crimes for decades, both torturing, mutilating, sexually assaulting, and, in some cases, murdering young women for their own sadistic gratification.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, when Fred was taken into police custody, he continually denied Rose was involved, claiming he had acted alone. Detectives knew this wasn&#8217;t true, but they needed evidence.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fred did eventually change his story when Rose shunned him in court. However, on January 1, 1995, Fred hung himself in prison, dying at age 53. So, police had to find a way to convict Rose West without the testimony of her husband.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Janet would have been a star witness, explaining in the new <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/true-crime/">true crime</a> docu-series, &#8220;He&#8217;d told me in the beginning about the pact that they had made, that he was going to take the brunt of it all, and that it was worth it.&#160;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;He was clearing up a lot of Rose&#8217;s mistakes, &#8216;little mistakes,&#8217; she used to call them. Rose was involved right from the onset. It was time to tell the truth.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">During the trial, Janet was asked if she had sold her story to the press, which she denied. In an unexpected turn of events, she suffered a stroke while on the stand and was rushed to hospital.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When she returned to court following treatment, it had emerged that she had, in fact, sold her story to the Daily Mirror for up to &#163;100,000, which had an impact on the validity of her testimony.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Even so, Rose was found guilty and convicted of 10 murders. She is currently incarcerated at the HM Prison New Hall in West Yorkshire, aged 71.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to reports, she <strong>still lives in Gloucester and keeps a low profile</strong>, having experienced negative press in the fallout of the trial. She has four sons and a daughter.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2035800/Appropriate-Adult-Police-forgive-serial-killer-Fred-Wests-confidante-Janet-Leach.html">2011 report</a> stated that Janet remarried the year prior and had started a new career as a health professional in the Gloucestershire area. However, in 2021, a neighbor told the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9582413/Fred-West-confidant-Janet-Leach-shops-near-search-suspected-victim.html">Daily Mail</a> that she&#8217;s now &#8220;quite reclusive,&#8221; and &#8220;doesn&#8217;t work anymore and lives alone.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Janet&#8217;s eldest son Paul Leach was critical of his mother for her relationship with Fred West, as she continued speaking with the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-serial-killer-documentaries-true-crime-2585711/">serial killer</a> after the interviews were over.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I think she fell under his spell. She was consumed by it all,&#8221; he told the outlet. &#8220;Rose West went through six &#8216;appropriate adults&#8217; &#8211; they couldn&#8217;t handle hearing all the details&#160; &#8211; but my mother kept on going back.&#160;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;She was a little scared in the beginning, and needed pills to sleep at night, but the relationship between them quickly became intense.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, Janet maintained that she was communicating with Fred to help the victims and their families. &#8220;By listening to his perversions, I thought I was helping,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was getting confessions out of him.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A 2011 drama mini-series titled Appropriate Adult tells Janet&#8217;s story, with Emily Watson taking on the lead role.
