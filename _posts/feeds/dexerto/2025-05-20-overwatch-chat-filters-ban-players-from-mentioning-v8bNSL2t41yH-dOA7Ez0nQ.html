<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Overwatch 2&#8217;s chat filters are preventing players from typing out &#8220;raccoon,&#8221; inadvertently banning them from talking about the game&#8217;s top esports team, Crazy Raccoon.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Swear filters are nothing new to games, but in a surprising turn of events, Overwatch 2&#8217;s is going so far that it&#8217;s not letting players discuss the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/">Overwatch</a> Champions Series 2025 Champions Clash winners.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 17, a screenshot from an Overwatch 2 game chat started gaining traction in the community after a player tried (and failed) to call their teammates &#8220;raccoons.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;My teammates might be rac****s, otherwise everyone played great,&#8221; their message stated, with &#8220;raccoons&#8221; being censored.</p>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-2&#8217;s-swear-filter-bans-&#8220;raccoons&#8221;" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Overwatch 2&#8217;s swear filter bans &#8220;raccoons&#8221;</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Apparently raccoons are not allowed?&#8221; the confused player asked the OW2 community.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As many in the comments mentioned, the word &#8220;raccoons&#8221; contains a racial slur, but in trying to filter out the word, the system is banning a completely different word in the process.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This also means that one of Overwatch 2&#8217;s top esports teams, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-champions-series-dallas-major-2667796/">Crazy Raccoon</a>, sometimes referred to as Crazy Raccoons, can&#8217;t be mentioned in chat, either.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Crazy Raccoon has been one of the two biggest stars in the OWCS since its inception, frequently either coming first in tournaments or placing second to their main rival, Team Falcons.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Users in the thread also mentioned how <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/marvel-rivals/nadeshot-mortified-after-marvel-rivals-trash-talk-backfires-in-worst-way-possible-3142817/">Marvel Rivals&#8217; chat filter</a>, which also bans plenty of words, hasn&#8217;t banned the word Raccoon because of the playable character, Rocket Raccoon.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This isn&#8217;t the first time that Overwatch&#8217;s chat filter has caused controversy. In 2024, a player was banned from the hero shooter for <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-player-banned-for-typing-gg-yipppeee-and-nice-shot-2482438/">typing &#8220;GG,&#8221; &#8220;yipppeee,&#8221; and &#8220;nice shot.&#8221;</a></p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When the player tried to get their month-long suspension reverted, Blizzard doubled down and claimed that their initial findings were correct.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s not clear yet if Blizzard will change their filters to allow players to actually type out &#8220;raccoon&#8221; or &#8220;raccoons&#8221; but if not, don&#8217;t expect to see any trash pandas added as animal heroes to fight alongside Winston and Wrecking Ball anytime soon.</p>
