<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Pokemon cards are making a comeback in McDonald&#8217;s Happy Meals after their debut in early 2025, but there&#8217;s a big catch if trainers wanna &#8220;catch &#8217;em all.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/mcdonalds/">McDonald&#8217;s</a> brought back its beloved collaboration with <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/">Pokemon</a> in January 2025, featuring 15 different trading cards from the Pokemon TCG in Happy Meals throughout February in the United States.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s been two months since customers could snag a card in their Happy Meal &#8212; but luckily, they&#8217;re coming back&#8230; at least, for certain regions.</p> 



<h2 id="h-dragon-type-pokemon-head-to-uk-mcdonald&#8217;s-in-happy-meal-card-packs" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Dragon-type Pokemon head to UK McDonald&#8217;s in Happy Meal card packs</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As announced in an animated promotional video on May 14, customers in the United Kingdom will now get the chance to snag one of several Dragon-Type cards in a special collab across the pond that lasts until July 17.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The packs feature Dragon-Type Pokemon like Charizard, Dragapult, Dragonite and Rayquaza, although other &#8216;mons like Evee, Pikachu and others are also available.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For a full list of the cards and their associated values, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/pokemon-x-mcdonalds-2025-collab-complete-card-list-values-reprints-explained-3038839/">head over to our guide here</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Trainers had better act fast &#8212; these collaborations with McDonald&#8217;s have gotten quite chaotic before, as fans spotted scalpers reselling the Happy Meal card packs online for steep prices mere days after launch in January 2025.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In fact, some were <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/pokemon-tcg-mcdonalds-cards-are-already-being-resold-for-absurd-prices-3038444/">listed as high as $799</a>, leaving trainers stunned. Luckily, The Pokemon Company has since implemented <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/the-pokemon-company-takes-big-step-in-fighting-against-scalpers-with-tcg-changes-3164379/">changes to help combat scalpers</a> from gaming the system by having the plastic wrap removed from the outside of card packs upon purchase.</p>  


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s also a good idea to check your Happy Meal for cards before heading out of the store; some customers warned the community that they <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/pokemon-tcg-fans-issue-warning-over-missing-mcdonalds-collab-cards-3038321/">hadn&#8217;t received any cards in their meal</a>, or even the wrong toy, by mistake.</p>
