title: LEGO shuts down Bionicle fan game after 8 years of work

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A team of developers who were working on a Bionicle fan game for years suddenly received a cease and desist from LEGO just months away from the public release of a demo, bringing all those years of work to an end.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Bionicle series was once one of the most popular franchises <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/lego/">LEGO</a> had in the early to mid-2000s, with them making TV series and games to try and build out the lore of the universe.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, the property has long been dead. New toys haven&#8217;t been released in several years, and it&#8217;s essentially a dormant franchise at this point that will likely never be brought back. At least, not in any official capacity.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Enter Team Kanohi, a group of fans who sought to bring the Bionicle series back from the dead. That is, until LEGO shut them down.</p>



<h2 id="h-bionicle:-masks-of-power-shut-down-by-lego" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Bionicle: Masks of Power shut down by LEGO</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Despite the Bionicle series being made for children originally, the actual lore behind the series is surprisingly deep. There are a number of passionate <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v5mk7k6Amo">Bionicle lorekeepers</a> who have connected the dots between every series and built out the universe more than the original creators probably intended. Some people are very, very big fans of it years after the franchise was discontinued.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Team Kanohi was among those fans, spending almost a decade on creating a game with their own original story that brings Bionicle back to life. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Similar to a third-person action game like God of War, it involved the player traversing a map to find upgrades and get through a central storyline. It had original music, Animal Crossing-like voice acting blurbs, an in-depth combat system, and a level of polish that shows the work they put in.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Despite our efforts to work with them, we have been asked to shutter the project in its entirety. Transparently, we are surprised by this development given our project&#8217;s age and the LEGO group&#8217;s reputation for amicable relationships with fan projects. Nonetheless, we are beheld to their whims and have no choice to comply,&#8221; lead developer Jordan Willis explained.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Along with this message, they shared a full walkthrough of everything they developed to make sure their years of work didn&#8217;t get lost forever.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, things get more shocking when you scroll into the description of that video and see the extremely long list of developers and contributors who worked on the project. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This wasn&#8217;t just a few fans putting together a game, they hired voice actors, had VFX artists, concept artists, an entire 3D art team with a senior leader, UI designers, lighting artists, a team of animators, a cinematics team, level designers, environmental artists, music composers, audio designers and more. This project was massive and was still planned to be released for free despite the amount of work they put in.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, the dev team has now officially opened their own game studio by the name of Unmasked Games and are already working on their own independent project titled Rustbound.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This has been heartbreaking news for our entire team, but we&#8217;re also incredibly excited about what the future has in store, and for what we&#8217;ll get the chance to create next. We hope that you&#8217;re all just as excited as we are,&#8221; <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vxLNEG4a40njC2XQ9-vAwEbJgV2SBrE68rNx8GimGYY/edit?tab=t.0">reads their official statement</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, while it&#8217;s the end of this fan project, these developers are trying to take it on the chin and make something even better with the experience they gained working on Bionicle: Masks of Power.</p>
