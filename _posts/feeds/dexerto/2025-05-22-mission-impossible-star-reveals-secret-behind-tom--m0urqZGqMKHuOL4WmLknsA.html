<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Everyone wants to be on Tom Cruise&#8217;s cake list &#8211;&#160;but, according to one <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/mission-impossible/">Mission: Impossible</a> star, it&#8217;s not always the same cake. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In 2015, Kirsten Dunst (who starred with Cruise in Interview with the Vampire) revealed she received a cake from the actor every year; specifically, a coconut bundt cake with white chocolate. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ten years on, more people have come forward with tales of being sent one of these extraordinary cakes, whether it&#8217;s his co-stars from Top Gun: Maverick and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-3194820/">Mission: Impossible &#8211;&#160;The Final Reckoning</a>, producers, or even journalists he&#8217;s met throughout his career. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you&#8217;re lucky enough to be on his list, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;d get the white chocolate coconut cake &#8211; but there are two other possibilities. </p>



<h2 id="h-simon-pegg-explains-how-tom-cruise-finds-his-cakes-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Simon Pegg explains how Tom Cruise finds his cakes </h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In an interview with Dexerto before the release of The Final Reckoning, Pegg explained how Cruise sources all of the cakes he sends every year, whether it&#8217;s at Christmas, for people&#8217;s birthdays, or any other occasion that warrants a cake. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Basically, he&#8217;ll go to the best bakery&#8230; for friends in the UK, it&#8217;s the Magnolia Bakery in Primrose Hill,&#8221; Pegg said. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Here&#8217;s the interesting thing: there is no Magnolia Bakery in Primrose Hill. Magnolia Bakery is a company based in the US, and while its banana pudding briefly made an appearance in London, it hasn&#8217;t opened a branch anywhere in the UK. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Could it be a slip of the tongue, and he actually meant the Primrose Bakery or one of the other nearby places? Or perhaps it&#8217;s an intentional misdirect (the former seems more plausible, but the IMF team has a lot of secrets). </p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It&#8217;s a different bakery in LA. Wherever you are in the world, he&#8217;ll find a bakery nearby. So it&#8217;s the best bakery, and the cake will either be a coconut bundt cake&#8230; or it&#8217;s like a chocolate cake, or a gingerbread house at Christmas,&#8221; Pegg added. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;He&#8217;s such a feeder&#8230; he&#8217;s always trying to make me fat.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Pom Klementieff also said it&#8217;s &#8220;so delicious&#8230; the way it&#8217;s packed with a bow on it, it&#8217;s just so special and beautiful. He gets the best gifts.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The bundt cake comes from Doan&#8217;s Bakery in Los Angeles, and it costs $130 to order one cake from Goldbelly (it serves 12-16, but let&#8217;s be honest, you&#8217;d eat the whole thing yourself). However, we don&#8217;t know anything else about any of the other cakes that Cruise likes to send his friends and colleagues.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Here&#8217;s another thing: Cruise doesn&#8217;t even eat any of the cake himself. &#8220;I love sugar, but I can&#8217;t eat it because when I&#8217;m training, you know, I&#8217;m doing all these movies,&#8221; he earlier told James Corden. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;So I send it to everyone. I send it to the stunt team. And I wait for the calls. Like, tell me about it.&#8221;</p>
