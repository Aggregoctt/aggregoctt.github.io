<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/stellar-blade/">Stellar Blade</a>&#8217;s PC release date has leaked ahead of its official launch, giving players an early look at new outfits for Eve as well as some exciting extras.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While Stellar Blade originally released on April 26, 2024, for the PS5, PC players have been patiently waiting to get their hands on Shift Up&#8217;s stylish hack-and-slash. However, on May 12, 2025, a new trailer was uploaded to the official PlayStation YouTube channel before being taken down.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Of course, that didn&#8217;t stop eagle-eyed fans from reuploading the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarblade/comments/1kkza3w/someone_made_an_oopsie_pc_trailer_june_11th/">trailer on Reddit</a>. Thanks to the early upload, we have confirmation that Stellar Blade&#8217;s PC version will release on June 11, 2025.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If that wasn&#8217;t exciting enough, the PC version features graphical enhancements and extras not seen in the PS5 version. These include AI upscaling, frame generation, unlocked frame rate, and more.&#160;&#160;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Interestingly, the PC version will also feature Japanese voice-over, which wasn&#8217;t present on international copies of the PS5 version. Stellar Blade&#8217;s PC release will also support ultrawide support (5:4 to 32:9) and dual sense controller support, so you&#8217;ll be able to hook up your PS5 controller.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Alongside the higher resolutions and improved environmental textures, the leaked trailer also showed a new boss fight against Mann, the robotic leader of the Sentinels. Shift Up will also introduce 25 new costumes for Eve, adding to her already impressive <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/all-stellar-blade-outfits-how-to-get-them-2528004/">outfit collection</a>. </p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While we don&#8217;t know if these new outfits will be free or obtained via paid DLC, the trailer has also indicated that players will be able to purchase the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/stellar-blade/stellar-blade-all-stellar-tear-locations-nier-automata-dlc-2984968/">Nier Automata</a> and upcoming <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/stellar-blade/stellar-blade-nikke-outfits-3130987/">Goddess of Victory: Nikke DLC</a> as a twin expansion pack.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Those who pre-order the PC version will also be able to get the Planet Diving Suit (White), Ear Armor Earrings, and Classic Round Glasses for Eve. Meanwhile, the Complete Edition bonuses reward players with the Fluffy Bear Drone cosmetic and Captain Planet Diving Suit.&#160;</p>
