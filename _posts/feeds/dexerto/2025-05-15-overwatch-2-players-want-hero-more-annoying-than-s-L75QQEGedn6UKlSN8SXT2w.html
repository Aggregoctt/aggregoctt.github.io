<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Sombra is one of Overwatch 2&#8217;s most divisive heroes, but there&#8217;s another character who&#8217;s getting the community&#8217;s blood boiling in Season 16. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The addition of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-devs-reveal-how-hero-bans-will-work-in-season-16-3182376/">hero bans</a> in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-season-16-patch-notes-3178758/">Overwatch 2 Season 16</a> was welcomed by most players. However, it hasn&#8217;t been well-received by those who main more controversial characters, as they&#8217;re finding themselves unable to use their favorites in many competitive matches. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Sombra has arguably been the biggest victim, as fans were <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-players-already-know-which-character-to-target-with-new-hero-ban-feature-3133908/">already planning to isolate her before the feature even arrived</a>. This was largely down to her kit, as it relies on sneaking up behind enemies, which many find tough and frustrating to counter.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now, though, there&#8217;s another hero that players are trying to ban just weeks after she arrived &#8212; Freja. </p>



<h2 id="h-ow2-players-call-for-freja-nerf" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">OW2 players call for Freja nerf</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Freja was first introduced at the start of Season 16 and was later given a slight buff to make her more competitive. But fans clearly feel the devs went too far in the opposite direction, with one fan calling for other players to ban her over Sombra.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Please ban Freja in Comp,&#8221; said the OP. &#8220;Everyone bans Sombra instantly, and lets this monster roam free.&#8221;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">They were far from alone, either, as plenty of the replies complained about how strong Freja is right now, thanks to her highly mobile kit that&#8217;s also deadly at longer range. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Freja is my first ban every game,&#8221; said one player, while another added: &#8220;Her take aim, dash reset, take aim loop is too strong IMO.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Good Freja&#8217;s are far more dangerous than a good Sombra ever has been. Sombra is just annoying as heck, same situation as Sojourn,&#8221; said a third.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While banning her in Competitive matches is a temporary solution, players are hoping that she will be nerfed soon.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Thank God I&#8217;m not alone. F**K FREJA!!!!!! SHE NEEDS A NERF!&#8221; said one angry reply, while another agreed: &#8220;You know what&#8217;s crazy, she actually got a hotfix buff earlier this season when she was already annoying and strong. No way she survives the mid-season patch, right?</p>
