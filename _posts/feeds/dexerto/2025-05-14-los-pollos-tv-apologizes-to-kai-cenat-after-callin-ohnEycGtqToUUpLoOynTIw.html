<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Kai Cenat not only received an apology from Los Pollos TV and his dad after he called Streamer University a &#8220;scam.&#8221; However, Kai also a pretty big offer from them.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Back in February, Kai Cenat revealed he had plans for one of his biggest streams yet, as he wanted to bring <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/kai-cenat-has-massive-university-plan-to-help-twitch-streamers-with-mrbeast-involved-3131895/">hundreds of content creators together at his own Streamer University.</a> The Twitch star also wanted to get big names like MrBeast and Mark Rober involved to teach some of the classes.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fast forward a few months, and the plan is almost a reality. Kai has got a university on board &#8211; but he won&#8217;t reveal where it is going to be &#8211; and has opened up the application process to content creators.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He was, however, heartbroken when Los Pollos TV&#8217;s dad <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/kai-cenat-hits-back-at-claims-streamer-university-is-a-scam-3194111/">claimed that the whole thing was going to be a &#8220;scam&#8221; and</a> a &#8220;money grab&#8221; that was comparable to stand-up comedy lessons.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-los-pollos-tv&#8217;s-dad-apologizes-to-kai-cenat" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Los Pollos TV&#8217;s dad apologizes to Kai Cenat</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Since then, Los Pollos&#8217; dad has issued an apology to Kai, and even extended an olive branch with an offer to be involved with Streamer University.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Kai, you know, man. It&#8217;s a free thing that he&#8217;s doing. When he said he was heartbroken, it upset me because he&#8217;s only said nice things about me. I always liked this kid. Every time we spoke, he&#8217;s cool,&#8221; Los&#8217; dad said.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I&#8217;m throwing this out there, because of what was said and the apology I just made, again, I feel terrible. If you&#8217;d like us to come in and give a lecture or seminar, the two of us will be there.&#8221;</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The AMP star has been reviewing applications for both students and faculty members at his Streamer University, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/mrbeast-responds-to-kai-cenats-streamer-university-as-twitch-star-wants-him-involved-3193064/">with MrBeast offering to teach attendees about YouTube.&#160;</a></p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Kai confirmed that the line-up of those involved will be announced &#8220;soon,&#8221; and it&#8217;ll be interesrting to see who makes the cut.</p>
