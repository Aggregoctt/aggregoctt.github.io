<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Twitch streamer and rapper DDG has been served with a restraining order from his ex-girlfriend Halle Bailey, who also accused the rapper of physical abuse.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Back in October, DDG &#8211; real name Daryl Granberry &#8211; and then-girlfriend Halle Bailey split up, which he described as &#8220;not an easy decision&#8221; to make. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;After much reflection and heartfelt conversations, Halle and I have decided to go our separate ways. This decision was not easy, but we believe it&#8217;s the best path forward for both of us,&#8221; he said.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The pair have had to interact as they have a son, Halo, but Bailey has now claimed that DDG was physically abusive towards her back in January as they attempted to talk about child visitation.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to court documents, which <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/05/13/halle-bailey-ddg-restraining-order-attack/?adid=social-tw">TMZ</a> has verified, the pair allegedly &#8220;started wrestling&#8221; and DDG &#8220;slammed&#8221; Bailey&#8217;s face onto a car steering wheel, chipping her tooth in the process. This occurred while their son was sitting in the car.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-halle-bailey-claims-ddg-&#8216;weaponizes&#8217;-fans-against-her" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Halle Bailey claims DDG &#8216;weaponizes&#8217; fans against her</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The court filing has also been made to give Bailey a restraining order against her former partner, as she also claimed that he entered her home without permission in March.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Additionally, Bailey claims that the streamer weaponizes his online presence against her. &#8220;Whenever he wishes to cause upset, he starts badmouthing me to his several millions of fans,&#8221; she said in the filing.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;He claims I am withholding our son and that I am with other men. As a result, I then receive threats and hate on social media. He seems to try to set up drama for his fans. He goes &#8216;live&#8217; ranting about me and alleges that I am keeping Halo from him. This is false. I have requested a set schedule, which he refuses.&#8221;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">DDG received the news about the restraining order while streaming with Adin Ross. &#8220;That can&#8217;t even be real, that&#8217;s the thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know where that came from. That&#8217;s not even real, I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As per the restraining order, the streamer is required to stay at least 100 feet away from his former partner at all times.&#160;</p>
