<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Jesse returned in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-3176859/">The Last of Us Season 2</a> Episode 5, arriving just in time to save Ellie and Dina. It&#8217;s a heroic moment, but it raises a scary question about his fate in Part 2.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After all, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/the-last-of-us/">The Last of Us</a> has already made it clear that it won&#8217;t hesitate to pull the trigger (or, in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-is-joel-dead-3182624/">Joel&#8217;s case, swing the club</a>) on its most beloved characters. The show&#8217;s world is brutal and unforgiving; there&#8217;s always something, somewhere, that wants to kill you. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Of all the new characters in Season 2, Jesse is arguably the most sensible. He always follows the rules, and even when he breaks them to find Ellie and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-dina-fate-games-3179569/">Dina</a> with Tommy, he doesn&#8217;t take any risks for the sake of it (hence why they let the Seraphites execute a man in Episode 5). </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Still, it doesn&#8217;t matter how careful anyone is in The Last of Us &#8211; everyone is at risk. So, does Jesse die in the original game? Massive spoilers to follow&#8230; </p> 



<h2 id="h-does-jessie-die-in-the-last-of-us-game?-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Does Jessie die in The Last of Us game? </h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>Jesse is killed by Abby in The Last of Us Part 2. </strong></p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While they reunite under different circumstances in the show, Jesse still ends up at the theater in Seattle with Dina and Ellie. In the game, after torturing Nora for information, Ellie sets out to find Abby. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Let&#8217;s just say, it doesn&#8217;t go well, to the point Tommy and Jesse convince Ellie to go home before anyone else gets hurt. As they plan out their route back to Jackson, Ellie and Jesse hear Tommy scream out from the lobby. As they burst through the doors, Abby shoots Jesse in the head, killing him instantly. </p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The impact of Jesse&#8217;s death, not just on what happens immediately after but the rest of the story, cannot be understated&#8230; but if you want to know more, you&#8217;ll need to play the game. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Also, it remains to be seen if Jesse will be killed off in The Last of Us Season 2 (or Season 3). Considering the series killed off Joel earlier than anyone expected, and it hasn&#8217;t veered from the original game&#8217;s events in any enormously different way, Jesse&#8217;s fate may be sealed &#8211; it&#8217;s just a matter of when. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking to the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2025-05-11/last-of-us-season-2-episode-5-jesse-young-mazino">LA Times</a>, Young Mazino (who plays Jesse) discussed his appearance in Episode 5. &#8220;He&#8217;s really pissed off that they&#8217;re there to begin with,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;He knows the stakes. He knows how serious it can get. There&#8217;s a lot of sh*t on his mind, but&#8230; for him, it&#8217;s about getting everyone to safety, surviving and then the emotions come later. Then we can hash it out.&#8221;</p>
