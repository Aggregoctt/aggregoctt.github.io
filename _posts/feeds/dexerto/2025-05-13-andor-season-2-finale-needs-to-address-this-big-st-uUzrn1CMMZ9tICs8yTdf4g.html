<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/andor-season-2-finale-episode-10-11-12-release-time-3194614/">Andor Season 2 finale</a> is almost here, and it has the opportunity to address one of the most baffling plot holes in all of Star Wars. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Tonight, fans will witness the penultimate chapter of Cassian <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/andor/">Andor&#8217;s</a> story, leading directly into the tragic, heroic events of Rogue One. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/andor-is-luthen-rael-a-jedi-theory-explained-1982279/">Will Luthen Rael be revealed as a Jedi</a>, will Dedra Meero end up on the Death Star, and what about Cassian&#8217;s sister? It remains to be seen if the series will answer everything &#8211; that said, it&#8217;s worth remembering that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> has left a lot of unanswered questions. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For example, how did Palpatine return in The Rise of Skywalker, how did Leia remember Padme, and &#8211; most of all &#8211;&#160;how did the Empire build a second Death Star so quickly after the destruction of the first one? </p>



<h2 id="h-andor-season-2-can-still-address-death-star-ii-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Andor Season 2 can still address Death Star II </h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you haven&#8217;t seen Rogue One and the original Star Wars trilogy, here&#8217;s what happens: the Rebels steal the plans for the Death Star, Luke Skywalker blows it up by exploiting its weakness (built in by Galen Erso), and two movies later in Return of the Jedi, it&#8217;s revealed that the Empire has constructed another Death Star. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For context, it took 20 years to build the first Death Star. It was glimpsed at the end of Andor Season 1, which is set four years before Rogue One &#8211; aka, the point at which we know it&#8217;s operational, as Krennic orders a test fire on Jedha City. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, this raises a question: even though it&#8217;s unfinished in Return of the Jedi, how could the Empire build a second Death Star in a fraction of the time (three years, to be exact)?</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s quite funny that we&#8217;re now getting this deeply emotional, ominous, and terrifying build up to the Death Star in A New Hope and then in Return of the Jedi there&#8217;s just Another One four years later,&#8221; one user <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/SCentralized/status/1921769417324503152">tweeted</a>, and another asked, &#8220;Genuine question: Does anything in canon explain how there&#8217;s a second one?&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The simple answer is&#8230; no (in the Legends canon, Palpatine leaked the plans to separatists so they could build Death Star II in private).</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There are ways to rationalize it; for example, you could argue that it took so long the first time because the Empire had to assemble the infrastructure to actually build a Death Star, so making another one wouldn&#8217;t take as long. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, without any firm answer in the current, established canon, Andor still has time to explain the Empire&#8217;s plans for a second Death Star, even if it&#8217;s just a small nod in a conversation between Dedra and Partagaz.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I feel like there should be a throwaway line in Andor referencing the fact that construction on a second Death Star is already well underway,&#8221; one fan <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/ChristAtheism/status/1921821893352452553">suggested</a>. &#8220;Can an Andor/Rogue One style movie be done for The Bothan Spies stealing the Second Death Star plans?&#8221; another <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/ReelDawg75/status/1920952816102682831">asked</a>.</p>
