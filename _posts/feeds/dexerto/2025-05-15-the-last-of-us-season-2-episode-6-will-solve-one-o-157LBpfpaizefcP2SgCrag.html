<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Episode 5 ended with an enormous gut-punch: as Ellie beat Nora with a pipe, it cut to black and flashed back to an earlier, more peaceful time, with Joel waking Ellie up in the morning. &#8220;Hey, kiddo.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-6-trailer-3194141/">A trailer has since confirmed that Pedro Pascal will reprise his role</a> in the next episode, which will be directed by <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/the-last-of-us/">The Last of Us</a> creator Neil Druckmann. It&#8217;s said to be incredibly &#8220;special.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Also, going by official images released by HBO ahead of its release, we&#8217;ll find out exactly what happened to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-2-eugene-explained-3177656/">Eugene</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-6-images-promise-eugene-backstory-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">The Last of Us Season 2 Episode 6 images promise Eugene backstory </h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the first episode of Season 2, Gail spoke about her late husband, Eugene, and how he was killed by Joel.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;You shot and killed my husband,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You killed Eugene and I resent you for it &#8211; no, maybe a little more than that, I hate you for it. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;And yes, I know you had no choice. I know I should forgive you, but I&#8217;ve tried and I can&#8217;t&#8230; because of how you did it. And looking at your face, sitting in our home, makes me so f**king angry.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The question is&#8230; why did Joel do it? Was he bitten, so Joel was forced to kill him before he endangered anyone else in Jackson, or was there an ulterior motive? Also, even if he was infected, Gail&#8217;s issue with &#8220;how [he] did it&#8221; is another point of curiosity; was he needlessly brutal?</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Whatever happened, Episode 6 is going to get into it. We already know that Eugene will be played by Joe Pantoliano, and images of him in the next episode have been released by HBO. Worryingly, he can be seen with his hands up, and it appears Joel and Ellie are the ones holding him at gunpoint. </p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking to&#160;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/">Variety</a>, Druckmann teased: &#8220;The way this character comes in really gets to the heart of Joel and Ellie and their relationship.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Co-showrunner Craig Mazin also said: &#8220;We talked a little bit about how Eugene could connect back to a brand new character, but more importantly, the way that their story directly impacts Joel and Ellie&#8217;s story. That&#8217;s the part that got exciting to us.&#8221;</p>
