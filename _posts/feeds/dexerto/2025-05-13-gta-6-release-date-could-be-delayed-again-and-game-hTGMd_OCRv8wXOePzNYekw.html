<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Grand Theft Auto 6 could actually suffer a further delay to its release date, and there are some game developers &#8220;praying&#8221; that it slips again.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Towards the end of 2024, a number of rumors and reports surfaced claiming that Rockstar Games had been preparing to delay <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-rumors-story-and-more-for-the-next-grand-theft-auto-game-245713/">GTA 6</a>&#8217;s release by a few months. At the start of May 2025, the iconic game devs confirmed that in a big blow to expectant Grand Theft Auto fans.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As of now, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-officially-delayed-until-2026-3189190/">the highly anticipated title is set to release on May 26, 2026.</a> The delay has, apparently, been good news for GTA 6, given that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/leaker-proven-correct-about-gta-6-reveals-more-about-the-games-development-3194398/">reputable leakers have claimed it&#8217;d be in a much worse place </a>if Rockstar stuck to their holiday 2025 release window.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Despite the devs releasing <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-trailer-2-blows-fans-away-with-insane-graphics-on-base-ps5-3190716/">a long-awaited second trailer</a> and revealing more details about Jason and Lucia, as well as<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/all-confirmed-gta-6-characters-3190548/"> a host of other characters</a>, the game still isn&#8217;t fully clear of the delay fears, as it could slip again.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That is according to Bloomberg&#8217;s Jason Schreier, who accurately reported GTA 6&#8217;s delay, as he noted the game could slip again.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;There&#8217;s no guarantee that May 2026 is a sure thing,&#8221; he said<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-09/-grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-is-impacting-every-game-company"> in a May 9 Bloomberg report</a>, noting that other games are trying to avoid the Grand Theft Auto release. In fact, some are &#8220;praying&#8221; that it does slip again.<br><br>&#8220;It&#8217;s a massive game of 4D chess playing out across the entire video-game industry, as business analysts at every major company try to discern whether Rockstar will actually finish the game in time for a May 2026 release date so they can plan accordingly.&#8221;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A further delay to Grand Theft Auto&#8217;s release would, undoubtedly, frustrate fans who are already up in arms that they&#8217;ve got to play Rockstar&#8217;s newest game yet.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There is also the chance that the GTA devs will fill that gap in the release calendar <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-insider-claims-rockstar-is-set-to-release-gta-4-remaster-for-new-consoles-3194365/">with a GTA IV port to modern consoles.</a></p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rockstar insider TezFun noted that the game has been in production for over a year now and could drop before the end of 2025.</p>
