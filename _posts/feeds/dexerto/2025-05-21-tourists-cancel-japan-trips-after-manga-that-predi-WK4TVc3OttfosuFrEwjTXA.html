<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Japan&#8217;s largest tourist demographics are canceling their trips to the country in droves after a manga that predicted the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster warned of another catastrophe to come in 2025.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The manga in question is Ryo Tatsuki 1999&#8217;s publication &#8216;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://urbanlegend.fandom.com/wiki/The_Future_I_Saw">The Future I Saw</a>.&#8217; The story was inspired by a collection of Tatsuki&#8217;s dreams, which she would record in a notebook upon waking.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One of her dreams inspired her to write the phrase, &#8216;The great disaster will occur in March 2011&#8217; &#8212; the same month and year that the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami happened, resulting in the Fukushima nuclear disaster.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That phrase graced the cover of &#8216;The Future I Saw&#8217; 12 years before the catastrophe took place. Once this fact became widespread, the previously obscure manga became a highly-coveted piece of media, even selling at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://medium.com/@AsianNight/the-manga-with-the-power-of-prophecy-the-future-i-saw-warns-of-the-next-great-calamity-4a2b6a2a1e23">auction for over 100,000 yen</a>.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In July 2021, Tatsuki was set to finish a &#8216;complete&#8217; edition of her prophetic manga. The day before the deadline, she dreamt of the words, &#8216;The real disaster will come in July 2025.&#8217;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The sea boils south of Japan in July 2025 and it will cause a mega tsunami,&#8221; she <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/new-updates/baba-vanga-predictions-can-comics-predict-the-future-how-new-baba-vanga-ryo-tatsukis-prophecies-as-a-manga-artist-are-causing-panic-worldwide/articleshow/121306848.cms?from=mdr">wrote in the manga</a>. According to her, the tsunami will stem from a violent underwater eruption that will hit Japan, Taiwan, and Indonesia. The crack, she says, will appear under the seabed between Japan and the Philippines.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In her dream, she envisioned an earthquake &#8216;three times&#8217; the size of the Tohoku quake, with a deadly tsunami resulting from an underwater eruption between Japan and the Philippines. The disaster will supposedly affect Japan, Taiwan and Indonesia.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Since her previous prediction turned out to be true, those who hoped to visit Japan during the summer are steering clear of the island country for the month of July.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/19/travel/japan-trips-canceled-fortune-tellers-comic-book-intl-hnk">reported by CNN</a>, travelers from Japan&#8217;s largest tourist sources are canceling their plans. CN Yuen, the managing director of a Hong Kong-based travel agency, says that trips to Japan plummeted in half during April, and are predicted to drop even more within the next two months.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">These travelers are largely from China and Hong Kong, which make up Japan&#8217;s second and fourth-largest tourist demographics. However, these fears have also made their way to Vietnam and Thailand, where social media teems with videos urging potential travelers to stay away.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Yuen says that these suspicions have become &#8220;ingrained&#8221; in people and said they &#8220;want to hold off their trip[s] for now.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Tatsuki has predicted a slew of other major global events that came true. For instance, she foresaw the 2020 pandemic and even the 1995 Kobe Earthquake, which <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Kobe-earthquake-of-1995">killed 6,400 people</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Given her apparent clairvoyance, Tatsuki&#8217;s prediction for July 2025 holds a lot of weight for those who are superstitious &#8212; and even physics in China are predicting a similar disaster for Japan at that time.</p>
