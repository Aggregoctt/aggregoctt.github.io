<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Apple will soon let users control their iPhone with their brain, but they&#8217;ll have to get an implant to make it work. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over the years, Apple has worked to make its devices increasingly accessible to people with all types of disabilities and impairments. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A report from <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-brain-computer-interface-9ec69919">The Wall Street Journal</a> says the Cupertino-based company is set to release its biggest accessibility feature yet, and it could come as soon as the end of 2025.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Apple is preparing to launch a way to control your iPhone, iPad, and Apple Vision Pro with your mind, but you&#8217;ll have to let them place an implant on your brain. </p> 



<h2 id="h-iphone-brain-controls-could-come-sooner-than-later" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">iPhone brain controls could come sooner than later</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Apple has partnered with Synchron to make the mind-control happen. The company they&#8217;ve partnered with makes a stent-like device that is implanted in a vein at the top of the brain&#8217;s motor cortex. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If it reaches full release, the implant could make Apple devices more accessible to tens of thousands of people with severe spinal cord injuries or ALS. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Synchron said <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250513927084/en/Synchron-To-Achieve-First-Native-Brain-Computer-Interface-Integration-with-iPhone-iPad-and-Apple-Vision-Pro">in a press release</a> that controlled trials of the device will start later in 2025, but one user already has the company&#8217;s implant installed.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Mark Jackson, who has ALS, is the early tester and has been able to use Apple&#8217;s Vision Pro headset to experience things he has never been able to do before, like stand over the ledge of a mountain in the Swiss Alps. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s still in early development, however. Jackson says he can&#8217;t use the tech to mimic moving a mouse cursor or touching a screen with his fingers, so navigation of the devices is much slower than if you were to use them normally.</p>
