<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Outdoor Boys, a massive YouTube channel primarily run by a man named Luke Nichols, will be going on indefinite hiatus effective immediately. He cited his massive YouTube growth as one of the main reasons, wanting to stop now before he gets too big to live a &#8220;normal life&#8221;.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Nichols isn&#8217;t wrong, he&#8217;s one of the fastest growing YouTubers on the platform. He gained 12 million subs in 18 months, going from around 2.5 million subs to almost 15 million in near record time. He&#8217;s up there with YouTube giants like <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/mrbeast/">MrBeast</a>, all without enabling comments on his videos and rarely posting to social media.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">His adventures around the world, both with his family and solo trips, have captivated audiences, and he&#8217;s gained a huge amount of recognition due to him filming outdoors content that&#8217;s on an entirely different level from what other YouTubers are producing.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, he&#8217;s stepping away from the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/@OutdoorBoys/featured">Outdoor Boys channel</a> due in large part to getting a little too famous.</p> 



<h2 id="h-outdoor-boys-explains-sudden-hiatus" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Outdoor Boys explains sudden hiatus</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Nichols explained that he&#8217;s spent a tremendous amount of time and energy creating content over the years, producing over 1100 videos across 2 channels. And, while letting up on the sheer amount of effort involved with that is part of the battle, the biggest reason is the amount of attention it&#8217;s brought his way.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The sheer volume of fans trying to contact me, trying to take pictures with me, or just trying to come up to me and talk in public can be a bit overwhelming at times. My wife and I, we both have real concerns about what this will do to our family if I keep growing my YouTube channel at this pace. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The time to stop is before this problem gets so out of hand that my family and I can live normal lives.&#8221;</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He explained that all three of his sons want to be YouTubers at this point, and that he wants to help them grow their channels and learn how to make content rather than just focusing on his own channel.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Nichols doesn&#8217;t plan on stepping away forever, but he won&#8217;t be making any new content for a long time. He has some unfinished YouTube videos to wrap up that he wants to release, but he&#8217;ll be dropping all of those at the end of 2025 and then stepping away from it all.</p>
