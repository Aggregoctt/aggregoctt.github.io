<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Twitch is finally taking one of YouTube and KICK&#8217;s biggest features in the form of live rewind, and it isn&#8217;t too far away from going, well, live.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over the last few years, as a few different platforms have challenged <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/">Twitch&#8217;s</a> dominance over the livestreaming world, the Amazon-owned platform has had to make a few changes.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Some of these have been little changes, barely noticeable to the everyday Twitch user, but there have also been some big ones. Most recently, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/twitch-reveals-big-changes-to-ban-system-more-severe-penalties-3138027/">the purple platform tweaked its rules on bans</a>, not only being more open about reasons for suspensions, but also allowing long-time bans to be lifted.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There has been one longtime change that, to this point, has yet to be realized, however. That is live rewind. It is a feature on both YouTube and KICK, allowing viewers to rewind a stream in real-time so that they can either catch up on a segment they missed or make a clip a little easier.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-twitch-is-finally-getting-live-rewind" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Twitch is finally getting Live Rewind</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Well, as per reporter Zach Bussey, Twitch is finally going to bring Live Rewind to the platform in the near future.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Twitch appears to be testing Live Rewind. Sources suggest it might be announced at Twitchcon Rotterdam 2025,&#8221; he <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/1921652751269830790">posted</a> on X (formerly Twitter) on May 11.&#160;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rewind is currently a feature on Twitch, but you have to ditch watching a live broadcast and open up the VOD. Plus, it takes a few minutes before the VOD actually has the previous few moments that you had been watching. So, it can be annoying.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Live Rewind would certainly be a bonus for those who use Twitch to watch esports, so that you can go back and clip a big highlight within a few seconds of it actually happening.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As Bussey notes, the feature isn&#8217;t live just yet, but it should be before long. Twitch will likely make a big deal about it, so, keep an eye out.&#160;</p>
