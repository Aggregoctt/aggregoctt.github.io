After all, nothing is worse than heading off to fight a monster only to realise you have no Healing Powder once you get into a spot of bother.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Luckily, to save you from farming the ingredients for your potions, the Fantasy Life i developers have released a few handy codes, offering free rewards to help you on your way. Here are all the currently active and recently expired codes to ensure you get the most out of your game.</p>

However, they have since been deactivated by the developers. As such, we&#8217;ve moved them to the expired list.
