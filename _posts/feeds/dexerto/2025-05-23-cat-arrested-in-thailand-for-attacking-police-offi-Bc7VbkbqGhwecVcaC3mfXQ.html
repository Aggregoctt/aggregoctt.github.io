<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A lost cat was arrested and had its mugshot posted online for repeatedly &#8220;attacking&#8221; police officers in Thailand after a concerned citizen found the feline on the streets.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Cats are known for their independent nature and sassy behavior, but one kitty took things to the next level after it got turned in to the fuzz.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The animal was <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3311403/cat-arrested-mugshot-taken-attacking-thai-police-during-rescue-amusing-netizens?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=section">brought into a Bangkok police station</a> on May 9 after a good samaritan found it alone, assuming it was lost.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The silvery striped American Shorthair seemed to be someone&#8217;s pet, boasting a pink collar and a feisty personality.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Officer Da Parinda Pakeesuk, a noted animal lover, decided to take the cat in&#8230; but it didn&#8217;t return his kind gesture with grace, instead biting and scratching him and several other officers on duty at the time.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a humorous twist of events, Pakeesuk decided to &#8216;process&#8217; the kitty for its heinous crimes, even posting photos taking the animal&#8217;s paw prints for police records.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The officer even added a comment to the &#8216;report&#8217; on the cat&#8217;s behalf, saying, &#8220;I was just hungry. I did not mean to bite anyone.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This cat has been charged with assaulting police officers and is about to be detained. Please share this post so her owner can come and bail her out,&#8221; Pakeesuk wrote in a post online that&#8217;s taking Thai social media by storm.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He took the cat home for the night, providing it with food, water, and a place to rest. &#8220;She is living her best life, while the police are the true victims,&#8221; he joked.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t long before the cat&#8217;s owner took notice of the situation and called the police station to alert them that the criminal kitty was actually theirs.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Its name is &#8216;Nub Tang,&#8217; which translates to &#8216;counting money&#8217; in English &#8212; and to celebrate the high-class cat&#8217;s return to its owner, officers gave it a flowery lace collar, which they took photos of to commemorate the occasion.</p>
