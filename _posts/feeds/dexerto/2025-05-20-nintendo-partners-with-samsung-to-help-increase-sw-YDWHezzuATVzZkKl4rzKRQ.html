<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2-2179693/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is almost upon us, with demand for the console skyrocketing. In fact, there&#8217;s so much demand that Nintendo has partnered with Samsung to help manage and hopefully increase production.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/nintendo-switch-2-finally-revealed-in-official-trailer-3031023/">Nintendo Switch 2 was announced</a>, fans went crazy for it. When the pre-orders opened, millions tried to get hold of the console across the world, with over 2 million residing in Japan alone. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/nintendo-boss-apologizes-as-switch-2-demand-is-way-too-much-for-them-to-keep-up-with-3184107/">Unfortunately, that was met with plenty of disappointment</a>, as Nintendo began to quickly run out of units,  meaning many won&#8217;t be able to grab the Switch 2 on release day.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But that doesn&#8217;t mean you won&#8217;t be able to get your hands on the console shortly after, as Nintendo has now partnered with Samsung to help create more to avoid any future disappointment or frustration.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-production-ramped-up-by-samsung-partnership" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Nintendo Switch 2 production ramped up by Samsung partnership</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As originally <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-20/nintendo-turns-to-samsung-to-make-chips-ramp-up-switch-2-output">reported by Bloomberg</a>, Nintendo has partnered with Samsung to help create the main chips for the Switch 2, to help ramp up production of the console so they can sell over 20 million units (as is projected).</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The original <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1085606/annual-unit-sales-nintendo-switch-worldwide/#:~:text=In%20its%20first%20year%2C%20the,of%20its%20console%20in%202020.">Switch sold around 13 million units</a> in the first ten months after its release, and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/nintendo-switch-2-will-break-console-launch-sales-records-according-to-analysts-3185359/">predictions among Nintendo reveal they expect the Switch 2 to reach around 15 million units sold</a> in the year to March, so it&#8217;s entirely understandable that they&#8217;ve pulled in another huge company to assist in the release.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Interestingly, as well as the main chips being supplied, Samsung has worked with Nintendo before. They were the company that produced the OLED screens for the original Switch. According to Bloomberg, Samsung &#8220;has also pushed for OLED panels to be used when Nintendo refreshes the Switch 2 in the future.&#8221;</p>
