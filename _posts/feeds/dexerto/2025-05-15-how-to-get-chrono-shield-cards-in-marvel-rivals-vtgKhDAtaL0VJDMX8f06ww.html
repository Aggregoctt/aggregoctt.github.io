<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Marvel Rivals&#8217; Chrono Shield Card is a new item that&#8217;s extremely useful to avoid rough losses in competitive. Here&#8217;s how to get it.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">To commemorate the game&#8217;s one-year Closed Alpha anniversary, devs have unveiled several new additions to keep players busy in the current season. Not only will they be bringing back the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/marvel-rivals/marvel-rivals-s0-battle-pass-rerun-dates-price-skins-3195081/">S0 Battle Pass</a>, but they will also be introducing a new item called Chrono Shield Cards.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Though it&#8217;ll still be a while before they make it to the game, this particular item has already become a hot topic in the community.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, what exactly can you use it for? And why is this such a big deal to a lot of players? Here are all the details you need to know about them and how you can obtain them in-game.</p>



<h2 id="h-chrono-shield-cards-explained" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Chrono Shield Cards explained</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>A Chrono Shield Card is a type of item that can be used in competitive play to prevent players from losing points or even deranking after a loss.</strong> To put it simply, having this item would automatically trigger the Chrono Shield mechanic in ranked.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The major difference is that, unlike the regular <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/marvel-rivals/what-is-chrono-shield-in-marvel-rivals-ranked-feature-explained-3035264/">Chrono Shield feature</a> that&#8217;s already been around for a while, this card bypasses any sort of recharge requirement. This means it will immediately take effect upon a defeat, regardless of your current shield charge, and as long as you have one active. Put simply, you won&#8217;t lose any points with one in effect.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If there is already an active Chrono Shield, however, then this card won&#8217;t get used at all. As seen in a teaser, it&#8217;s confirmed that the Chrono Shield Cards <strong>aren&#8217;t permanent</strong>, as they will automatically be removed at the end of a season.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>Crucially, there is an item limit of 20, and only those in Gold rank and below can use it.</strong></p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>Chrono Shield Cards can only be obtained by participating in events, as they will not be for sale.</strong> So, don&#8217;t expect them to hit the shop anytime soon.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Right now, the only way you can obtain them is by participating in the Galacta&#8217;s Gift event, which will begin on May 15, 2025.&#160; To unlock them, you&#8217;ll need to play matches in Quick Play, Competitive, or Practice vs. AI.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Many were quickly worried this new item would encourage more people to throw games since they know they won&#8217;t be demoted no matter what they do.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, devs have made it clear in a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1922807616859689254">statement</a> that this is only available to use for low-ranked players. &#8220;The purpose is to allow lower-ranked players to enter ranked mode with even less pressure through this mechanism,&#8221; they wrote.</p>
