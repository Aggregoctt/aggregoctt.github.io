<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A man in Bejing is going viral in China for learning a 2,000-year-old combat style to compete in a Slap Fighting tournament.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Slap Fighting, a new combat sport where competitors take turns slapping each other, has taken the internet by storm, partly thanks to Dana White and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/dana-white-teases-power-slap-game-2205020/">Power Slap</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The sport went super mainstream in 2022 when YouTube star <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/logan-paul/">Logan Paul</a> teamed up with the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/logan-paul-arnold-schwarzenegger-join-forces-to-host-slap-fighting-tournament-1768741/">host the Slap Fighting Championship</a>, and now, one man is practicing an ancient martial art to become a better warrior.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">36-year-old Zhao Honggang, a martial artist and Chinese <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/">influencer</a>, is gearing up for a Slap Fighting tournament in Japan &#8211; and he&#8217;s been using &#8216;tongbeiquan&#8217; to get an advantage over his opponents.</p>



<h2 id="h-man-hones-his-skills-in-2,000-year-old-martial-art-for-slap-fighting" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Man hones his skills in 2,000 year old martial art for Slap Fighting</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3310304/chinese-man-trains-rigorously-martial-arts-compete-slap-fighting-tournament">South China Morning Post</a>, Honggang is a ninth-generation inheritor of the Qi family style, a branch of tongbeiquan.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Tongbeiquan draws inspiration from the movement of apes and involves generating power from the back and shoulders to deliver powerful strikes with one&#8217;s hands.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Honggang believes that mastery of this technique will give him an edge and allow him to add another achievement to his growing list of martial arts feats.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He emerged victorious at the 2024 inaugural Zhangjiakou National Martial Arts Exchange Conference and earned the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/">MMA</a> championship at the Henan &#8220;King of Kung Fu&#8221; tournament.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">To prepare for slap fighting, Honggang is also lifting dumbbells with his head to strengthen his neck and facial muscles.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;If I knock out my opponent with a single slap, I win. I mainly want to spar with international competitors and let them know the unique power of tongbeiquan,&#8221; the 36-year-old said. &#8220;I also hope to bring Chinese martial arts to the world stage.&#8221;</p>
