<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The increase in tariffs between the USA and China has impacted plenty, but gaming has become one of the most notable hit, especially with the upcoming release of the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/nintendo-switch/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and the number of games coming from China. In fact, the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/nintendo-confirms-new-switch-2-us-pre-order-date-launch-price-after-delay-3182178/">Switch 2 had to pull its pre-orders and revisit its pricing</a> to combat heightened costs.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s not just the Switch 2 that&#8217;s facing some difficulty. The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/renting-a-ps5-is-becoming-a-massively-popular-option-as-prices-increase-3183253/">PlayStation 5 could be going up in price again</a>, according to Sony.</p>



<h2 id="h-sony-cfo-warns-that-playstation-5-could-go-up-in-price-again" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Sony CFO warns that PlayStation 5 could go up in price again</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">During their <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q4_sonypre.pdf">quarterly earnings</a>, Sony revealed that the current cost of the PlayStation 5 may be increasing thanks to the current tariffs between China and America.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;In terms of the tariffs, we are not just simply calculating the simple tariffs to come up with 100 billion yen, but are thinking about the current available information and looking at the market trend, we may pass the price [to customers] and also shipment allocation. So we are taking different measures in managing to come up to the 100 billion yen.&#8221; explained Sony&#8217;s CFO, Lin Tao.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">100 billion yen is the equivalent of 512 million dollars, so they have a large amount of money to make up, and it stands to reason that the prices could increase for the customer.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Tao went on to explain that they&#8217;re also looking into the likelihood of producing their hardware locally: &#8220;The PlayStation 5 is being manufactured in many areas [its components], so whether its going to be manufactured in the US or not, it needs to be considered going forward in such a critical situation,&#8221; but it&#8217;s certainly an area they&#8217;re exploring.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Interestingly, the increase in price is something many different publishers and companies are looking into, only heightening the likelihood that we&#8217;ll see booth games and consoles getting more expensive in the future. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/nintendo-expects-to-lose-tens-of-millions-on-switch-2-sales-due-to-tariffs-3195017/">Even Nintendo is preparing for the impact</a> it&#8217;ll have on its release.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raised-xbox-console-and-game-prices-analysts-say-playstation-and-everyone-else-could-be-next">Speaking to IGN</a>, Rhys Elliott, head of market analysis at Alinea Analytics, explained that &#8220;on top of the hardware price hikes, we&#8217;ll likely see PlayStation increasing software prices as well. With Nintendo and Xbox raising software prices, the floodgates are now open.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With PlayStation warning fans that they&#8217;re likely following suit, only time will tell to see how much the console&#8217;s price increases, or if they find a way to keep it at its current price.</p>
