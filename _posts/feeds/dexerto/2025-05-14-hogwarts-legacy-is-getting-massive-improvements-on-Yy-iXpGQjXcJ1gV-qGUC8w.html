<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Switch 2 version of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a> will bring huge improvements to the magical ARPG, with enhancements to graphics, audio, load times, and more.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While Hogwarts Legacy originally released on the Switch in November 2023, the port was far from the optimal way to play. Unlike the Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC counterparts, the original Switch version had significantly more loading screens, muddier textures, and a much lower frame rate.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, on May 13, 2025, Warner Bros. Games released a gameplay video of Hogwarts Legacy running on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2-2179693/">Switch 2</a>. Not only have the visuals been drastically improved, but the overall performance is looking good on Nintendo&#8217;s eagerly anticipated console. </p> 



<h2 id="h-hogwarts-legacy-on-switch-2-brings-big-upgrades" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 brings big upgrades</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The most frustrating part of the Hogwarts Legacy Switch port was the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/hogwarts-legacy/hogwarts-legacys-switch-port-omits-one-of-its-defining-features-2382668/">loading times</a>, with the worst offender being Hogsmeade. Whenever players ventured into the village or walked into a shop, they had to enter a loading screen.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Well, as highlighted in the comparison video, the Switch 2 version features a seamless transition to this area, mirroring the Xbox Series S/X and PS5 ports. Warner Bros has also been keen to show off the improved graphics, with the Switch 2 drastically improving both resolution and textures.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Environments and characters no longer look super blurry, and there are now enhancements to lighting and shadows. These are most notably shown in combat, where spells are more vibrant and light reflects off the waters surrounding Hogwarts Castle.&#160;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s important to note that when docked, the Switch 2 can output up to 1440p at 120 Hz or 4K resolution at 60 Hz with HDR. So, it&#8217;s only natural that Hogwarts Legacy would look drastically better than its predecessor.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Interestingly, the official Nintendo website listing for Hogwarts Legacy notes that the Switch 2 version will include Joy-Con 2 mouse sensor support. Quite what this means has yet to be determined, but maybe players will be able to use the Joy-Con motions to cast spells?&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Hogwarts Legacy owners on Switch can purchase the Switch 2 upgrade for $10 via the eShop, while the Digital Standard Edition and Digital Deluxe Edition cost $59.99/$69.99.</p>
