<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Are Ethan and Grace a couple, or is it just a situationship? After <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-review-3194820/">Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning</a>, Hayley Atwell has broken down their unique relationship. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/mission-impossible/">Mission: Impossible</a> 3, Ethan Hunt got his first proper love interest (who knows what happened to Thandiwe Newton&#8217;s Nyah in M:II): Julia. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At the end of Ghost Protocol, it&#8217;s revealed that he faked her death so she could live a peaceful life without any risk of being affected by the IMF&#8217;s missions. This paved the way for Ilsa Faust, a fierce MI6 agent who&#8217;s basically Ethan&#8217;s soulmate; they are one and the same, and in Dead Reckoning, there&#8217;s no doubt that they love each other. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Sadly, she died so someone else could live: Grace, the pickpocket introduced in Dead Reckoning and the newest member of the IMF. Ethan and Grace share a strong, emotional connection &#8211; but is it romantic? Spoilers to follow&#8230; </p> 



<h2 id="h-hayley-atwell-explains-ethan-and-grace&#8217;s-relationship-in-mission:-impossible-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Hayley Atwell explains Ethan and Grace&#8217;s relationship in Mission: Impossible </h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">By the end of The Final Reckoning, Grace is a fully-fledged member of Ethan&#8217;s team. However, while they have a close, affectionate bond, it&#8217;s never made clear if they have a romantic connection. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking to Dexerto, Atwell said: &#8220;I&#8217;m pleased that she wasn&#8217;t a notch on the bed post either, [or] that she was the new token brunette. I think that we want more from our action films. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The idea that female representation is reduced to becoming the object of desire or running on a romantic agenda is just not something audiences are interested about anymore, I&#8217;m certainly not.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For Atwell, the &#8220;natural evolution&#8221; of Ethan and Grace&#8217;s chemistry &#8220;takes you in lots of different places.&#8221;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;With anyone in kind of an intimate relationship with anyone, they have different versions of themselves and different circumstances bring out different qualities in that relationship, whether it&#8217;s sibling, maternal, paternal, romantic, intellectually stimulating &#8211;&#160;I think you can do lots of things to each other. I think ultimately they care about each other as human beings.&#8221;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This echoes what Atwell said in another interview with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hayley-atwell-mission-impossible-tom-cruises/">CBS News</a>, where she described Grace&#8217;s &#8220;nuanced intimacy&#8221; with Ethan. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The woman is not just the object of desire or not led with a romantic agenda,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;There&#8217;s intellectual stimulation between them, common cause that brings them together, something that feels sibling-like, maternal.&#8221;</p>
