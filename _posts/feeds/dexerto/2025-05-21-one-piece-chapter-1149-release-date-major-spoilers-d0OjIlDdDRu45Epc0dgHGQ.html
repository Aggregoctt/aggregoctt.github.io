<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Titled &#8216;One Second&#8217;, One Piece Chapter 1149 picks up right where the previous chapter left off. Gaban&#8217;s fight with Sommers continues. He uses Haki on his axes to cut the Knight&#8217;s body so that he stays alive but can&#8217;t regenerate anymore.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">To stop him, Gunko threatens to kill Colon if Gaban doesn&#8217;t surrender.

Gunko suddenly regains control of her mind and tries to free Brook.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, before she succeeds, Imu takes control of her body. The mysterious ruler of the world is furious with the God&#8217;s Knights for taking so much time. With them gone, the Holy Land of Mary Geoise is under attack and currently burning. It&#8217;s unclear who the attackers are, but the scale of the attack, it&#8217;s probably the Revolutionary Army.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One Piece Chapter 1149 ends with Imu&#8217;s words: &#8220;Imu will show how a god rules over the world.&#8221;</p>
