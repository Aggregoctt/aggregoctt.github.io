<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Grand Theft Auto fans are convinced one of the characters in GTA 6 has been changed after Rockstar Games were called out for money over their likeness.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">2025 was supposed to be the year that Rockstar Games finally released <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/gta-6/">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. However,<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-officially-delayed-until-2026-3189190/"> they&#8217;ve delayed the game until May 26, 2026,</a> instead, as they need a bit more time on it.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It hasn&#8217;t been all bad news, though. The iconic game devs have<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-trailer-2-finally-reveals-more-story-details-3190524/"> released a second trailer</a> and close to 100 screenshots for fans to obsess over. And obsess over them they have. They&#8217;ve found new cars, locations they want to explore, and possibly characters returning from GTA 5.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On top of that, fans are also convinced that Rockstar have changed the look of one character who appeared in both trailers because a Florida man called them out to pay him for his likeness.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-rockstar-called-out-to-pay-florida-man-for-gta-6-npc" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Rockstar called out to pay Florida Man for GTA 6 NPC</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The character, who appears in both trailers wearing a white vest, gold jewelry with a bull attached, and sunglasses, has had his hair changed between the two trailers.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That, fans are convinced, is because TikToker zoeepoppyy <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zoeepoppyy/video/7314890436236053802">claimed</a> that Rockstar had used his likeness for the character and wanted to be paid. &#8220;They gone cloned Tyrone. Change the character to my name, thats me! GTA, I need my money man,&#8221; he said.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;That literally is him though, they even got his exact nose shape,&#8221; one fan said. &#8220;The original was better they should have just cut him a check,&#8221; another added. &#8220;I mean it really did look like him,&#8221; another commented.&#160;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Some fans claimed that the TikToker should have waited until GTA 6 was released rather than calling out Rockstar so soon.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;He should have just waited till the game was published at least,&#8221; one added, with another saying: &#8220;Had the opportunity of a lifetime to create a whole brand for himself and threw it away.&#8221;</p>
