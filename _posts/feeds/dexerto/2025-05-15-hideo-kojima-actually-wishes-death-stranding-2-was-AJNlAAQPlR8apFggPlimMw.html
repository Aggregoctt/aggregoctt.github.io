<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/death-stranding-2-trailer-platforms-story-more-2006671/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> is almost here, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-cast-all-actors-characters-3160555/">bringing a star-studded cast</a>, stunning visuals, and a unique story. However, it&#8217;s not as controversial as creator Hideo Kojima would have liked.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s no secret that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/hideo-kojima/">Hideo Kojima</a> loves a complicated, artsy, and more unique style of game. This is especially true in Death Stranding, which featured a baby in a backpack and acid rain. As such, when the sequel was announced, fans were strapping themselves in for another wild ride.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, it seems this ride may be a little more Metal Gear than Death Stranding after Hideo Kojima himself revealed he wasn&#8217;t too pleased with the Death Stranding 2 test reviews, wishing the game was more &#8220;controversial.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="h-hideo-kojima-is-not-happy-with-high-death-stranding-2-reviews" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Hideo Kojima is not happy with high Death Stranding 2 reviews</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">During an interview with Edge Magazine, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/test-death-stranding-2-reviews/">as reported by VGC</a>, Kojima explained that he did &#8220;a lot of monitoring tests for the original Death Stranding. I&#8217;d find that four out of ten people would love the game, but six would say it was a terrible game. For me, I think that&#8217;s a good balance. But with the playtests for Death Standing 2: On the Beach, everyone seems to be positive.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Positive reviews, especially ones higher than the original game, usually mean it&#8217;s going to be a success, and that Kojima has created another great adventure. However, for this developer, it&#8217;s not enough. In fact it&#8217;s not what he&#8217;s trying to do with the game at all.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Sony is pleased, of course, but I do wish I was a bit more controversial,&#8221; continued Kojima, who went on to add that &#8220;Blockbuster films need an 80 percent approval rating &#8211; I don&#8217;t want to make games like that. I&#8217;m not interested in appealing to the mass market, or selling millions of copies&#8230; &#160;That&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m aiming for.&#8221;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He clarified: &#8220;In essence, I don&#8217;t want to simply recreate something that&#8217;s already in the world. I want to make something new.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Of course, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will undoubtedly be something new, filled with the classic Kojima flair. But it&#8217;s likely not going to be as &#8220;controversial&#8221; as he intended.</p>
