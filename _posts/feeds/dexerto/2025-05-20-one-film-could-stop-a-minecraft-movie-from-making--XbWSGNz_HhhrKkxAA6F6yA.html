<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/a-minecraft-movie-review-3170716/">A Minecraft Movie</a> is slowly closing in on a $1 billion box office haul &#8211; but it may be too late, as one film is about to steal its audience. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Excluding <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/how-to-watch-ne-zha-2-streaming-3136184/">Ne Zha 2</a> (which is comfortably one of the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/top-50-highest-grossing-movies-of-all-time-1856841/">highest-grossing movies</a> of all time with its $1.89 billion haul), A Minecraft Movie is hundreds of millions ahead of other Hollywood movies this year. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It has grossed just shy of $930 million worldwide, making it the second-biggest video game movie ever behind The Super Mario Bros Movie (which made $1.36 billion, so it&#8217;ll keep the top spot for the foreseeable future).</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As the film went viral, between <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/cinema-bans-a-minecraft-movie-viewers-chicken-jockey-warning-3183329/">theaters being trashed with the &#8220;chicken jockey&#8221; trend</a> and Jack Black&#8217;s &#8216;Steve&#8217;s Lava Chicken&#8217; hitting the charts, it was widely predicted to crack the $1 billion barrier. It&#8217;s not impossible, but another film is going to make that feat incredibly hard to achieve. </p>



<h2 id="h-lilo-and-stitch-may-ruin-a-minecraft-movie&#8217;s-billion-dollar-chances-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Lilo and Stitch may ruin A Minecraft Movie&#8217;s billion-dollar chances </h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the words of Disney CEO Bob Iger, Lilo and Stitch is tracking to have an &#8220;enormous&#8221; opening weekend. As reported by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/lilo-stitch-box-office-advance-ticket-sales-1236388406/">Deadline</a>, the live-action remake has already posted the best first-day ticket presales for a PG movie this year.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That means it&#8217;s set to beat A Minecraft Movie, which opened with $313 million worldwide in its first weekend. Lilo and Stitch is also opening over the four-day Memorial Day holiday, so there&#8217;ll be guaranteed footfall in cinemas &#8211;&#160;which means a lot of families buying tickets.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It is no surprise that audiences are racing to our platform to secure their tickets for what is set to be a memorable Memorial Day weekend when Stitch makes his triumphant return to the big screen,&#8221; Jerramy Hainline, EVP of&#160;Fandango, said. </p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Lilo and Stitch&#8217;s first-day presales are second to one other movie: 2019&#8217;s The Lion King remake, which grossed $1.65 billion by the end of its theatrical run. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, what does that mean for A Minecraft Movie? Well, when Lilo and Stitch hits multiplexes worldwide, cinemas will make plenty of room for it with dozens of screenings every day between Friday and Monday. Minecraft won&#8217;t leave cinemas, but it&#8217;ll occupy far less screens, which means less tickets. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Also, crucially, there is an overlap with audiences. While Minecraft has the advantage of a built-in, older fanbase, it&#8217;s still a family film &#8211; and Lilo and Stitch is the ultimate opponent, a remake of a modern Disney classic beloved by audiences of all ages. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s reasonable to expect three weeks of box office domination from Lilo and Stitch, until the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/how-to-train-your-dragon-live-action-movie-release-date-cast-plot-2063071/">How to Train Your Dragon remake</a> comes and shakes things up once more. </p>
