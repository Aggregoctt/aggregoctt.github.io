<div>
<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A former id Software environment artist Thao Le who contributed to RAGE and DOOM, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.thisisthaole.com/QuakeSP-Exploration.php">uploaded screenshots</a> of a long-rumored project, presumably Quake 5, that was shelved during the development of DOOM 4 and RAGE.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now, years later and with <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/doom-the-dark-ages-review-3190198/">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> already released, these images offer a rare glimpse into a direction id Software explored but ultimately never shipped.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For years, fans have begged for Quake 5. While the Quake universe remained quiet, other id franchises like DOOM came roaring back to life.</p> 



<h2 id="h-quake-5-was-real-but-got-cancelled-in-2016" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Quake 5 was real but got cancelled in 2016</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Quake 4 launched way back in 2005, and since then, players have had little new to chew on, aside from Quake 1 and Quake 2 remasters. Speculation spiked in 2025, with whispers of a revival. Now, Thao Le&#8217;s reveal has only thrown fuel on the fire.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The images, taken from a scrapped IdTech 5 single-player project, showcase surreal environments that unmistakably echo Quake&#8217;s DNA: massive gothic stone structures fused with cold mechanical elements. In Le&#8217;s own words, it was &#8220;old machinery melted into stone.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The art style sits somewhere between Quake 1&#8217;s oppressive, eldritch atmosphere and modern experimentation, featuring floating blocks, shifting gears, and environments that looked like they might collapse at any moment.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s even a Shambler tucked into one shot for scale, a deliberate nod to Quake 1&#8217;s bestiary. But the overall tone feels like a conceptual reboot, not a direct sequel. That&#8217;s exactly what stirred such a mixed reaction from <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/quake-5-was-in-development-at-id-during-doom-4-rage-id-employee-uploaded-a-ton-of-screenshots-on-their-work-of-the-cancelled-project.1188828/">fans</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This looked visually so cool. I&#8217;m super bummed it got cancelled and we got Eternal instead,&#8221; one fan lamented.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Another echoed a long-standing wish: &#8220;I&#8217;d still love a Quake 1 direct sequel, building on that world and gameplay with updated visuals. It&#8217;s a shame we never got one.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Still, many are realistic about the era this came from. &#8220;Given their output at the time of this, though, I doubt this project would have delivered what I wanted,&#8221; one player noted. &#8220;id really seemed to be trying to find themselves back then. I&#8217;m happy they did.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s also a cautious optimism: &#8220;I&#8217;m really curious to see what they do next now that DOOM: The Dark Ages is out. I&#8217;d definitely be far less hyped for a Quake game than I was for modern DOOM, but I&#8217;d still check it out and be curious to see what they make of it.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Today, id Software&#8217;s focus is likely shifting again. With DOOM: The Dark Ages now in players&#8217; hands, the studio&#8217;s roadmap may finally allow space to revisit other classics. Whether Quake gets a full resurrection remains uncertain. But as Le&#8217;s concept art shows, the appetite and the imagination for it never really went away.</p>
