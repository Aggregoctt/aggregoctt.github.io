<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Warzone&#8217;s Gulag is supposed to be a 1v1 fight for survival, but one player&#8217;s final stand was thrown into chaos when he was attacked by a zombie. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One of the main elements that separates <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/warzone/">Warzone</a> from its battle royale rivals is the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/rank-warzone-gulag-best-worst-1663610/">Gulag</a>. This feature gives players one final chance to rejoin the match after death, as long as they can win a shootout against another fallen player. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">These quick fights rely on pinpoint accuracy and decision-making, so even the smallest interference, like enemies throwing rocks from above, can prove costly. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If there&#8217;s one thing you wouldn&#8217;t be expecting in the Gulag, though, it&#8217;s to be attacked by an undead zombie. But that&#8217;s exactly what happened to this player in a bizarre glitch. </p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-glitch-spawns-zombie-in-the-gulag" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Warzone glitch spawns zombie in the Gulag</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Warzone pro Ryda shared a clip sent in by one of his viewers, showing them gearing up for what appeared to be just another Gulag fight. However, while the timer was counting down, the dark shadow appeared and the player&#8217;s armor was instantly broken. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While we don&#8217;t get a clear view of the assailant, you can hear the unmistakable growl of a zombie from Black Ops 6 Zombies. It then quickly vanished, and the player was forced to regain their composure and try to win the 1v1. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The video doesn&#8217;t go on long enough to see if they made it out of the fight alive, but they&#8217;d already taken damage, and the incident clearly surprised them. To make matters worse, this was in a game of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/best-warzone-ranked-play-loadouts-2998722/">Ranked Play</a>, meaning there was <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/warzone-ranked-rewards-divisions-how-it-works-2520977/">SR </a>on the line.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s not entirely clear what caused this glitch, as we&#8217;ve been unable to find any other reports of zombies infecting Warzone. Some replies suggested that it might have been an Emote, but this doesn&#8217;t explain why they took damage, or why the player was visibly confused by what happened. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s also possible that it wasn&#8217;t actually a zombie, but another player who was hitting them with a melee before the fight started. While it doesn&#8217;t appear to be a widespread issue, players have been left baffled by the clip.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Nobody would believe him if he didn&#8217;t get footage&#8230;&#8221; said one reply, while another added: &#8220;Bro I&#8217;d TWEAK if that happened to me.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Imagine losing SR because you died to a f*****g zombie,&#8221; added a third.</p>
