<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/squid-game-season-3-3015846/">Squid Game Season 3</a> is set to feature the most &#8220;intense&#8221; games to date, according to the show&#8217;s creator &#8211; and if you have this phobia, it&#8217;s going to be a tough watch. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That said, everyone should be terrified of the challenges in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/squid-game/">Squid Game</a>, considering you die if you lose. Some are worse than others; if you&#8217;re eliminated during Red Light Green Light or Dalgona, you get shot, so you&#8217;d (hopefully) die quickly. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/squid-game-season-2-mingle-most-upsetting-game-3010707/">Mingle</a> is arguably the worst, forcing its losers to run around as if they have any chance of escaping death. And then you have Tug of War and Glass Bridge, with people plummeting to the ground and presumably dying in crumpled, agonizing ways. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If the latter games made you uncomfortable, strap in for Season 3&#8217;s heart-thumping games. </p>



<h2 id="h-squid-game-creator-promises-&#8220;intense&#8221;-games-in-season-3" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Squid Game creator promises &#8220;intense&#8221; games in Season 3</h2>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Season 2 featured some of the show&#8217;s toughest games, but Squid Game creator Hwang Dong-hyuk promises they&#8217;ll get even worse in the third season.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;In the case of season 3, I wanted to introduce games that could really show the lowest bottom of human beings, because the series itself is reaching its climax,&#8221; he told <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://ew.com/squid-game-creator-hwang-dong-hyuk-final-season-exclusive-11738910">EW</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I wanted very intense games to bring out the bottom parts of human nature.&#8221;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While Hwang didn&#8217;t get into many specifics about what the games will entail, he wanted to focus on one phobia in particular: heights. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;In Season 1, we had lots of games like Tug of War that really utilized height and the fear that this height gives, but in the case of Season 2, we didn&#8217;t have that element,&#8221; he said.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;That is why in Season 3, I decided to introduce games that could really infuse fear in people with sheer height.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Excluding one spoiler accidentally shared on social media by one of the stars, it&#8217;s unclear who&#8217;ll make it out of Squid Game alive. &#8220;Season 3 is indeed a finale,&#8221; Hwang pledged, and while it&#8217;ll show the worst of humanity, it&#8217;ll also focus on how we can preserve it, and &#8220;how we should remain humans even amidst this intense competition.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I try to pose that as a final question,&#8221; he added. </p>
