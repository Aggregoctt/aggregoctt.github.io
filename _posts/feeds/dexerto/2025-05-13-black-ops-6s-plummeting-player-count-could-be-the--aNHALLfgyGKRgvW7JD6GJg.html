<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Call of Duty fans are actually quite pleased about Black Ops 6&#8217;s plummeting player count, as it could spell the end of Warzone and might shift the focus back onto multiplayer.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With Verdansk returning to Warzone, and a host of big changes being made to multiplayer, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-season-3-update-3144783/">Black Ops 6 Season 3</a> was supposed to revive interest in Call of Duty&#8217;s current cycle.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/how-many-people-play-warzone-2-modern-warfare-2-player-count-1992250/">Initially, the game&#8217;s player count rocketed. </a>Verdank&#8217;s return to Warzone meant that fans who had walked away from the battle royale would, at least briefly, come back. The knock-on effect of that also saw players heading back to multiplayer, and, for a while, things seemed pretty rosy.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, since the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-season-3-reloaded-update-3181583/">Season 3 Reloaded </a>mid-season update,<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-sees-lowest-call-of-duty-player-count-in-years-despite-record-breaking-launch-3193240/"> the player count has plummeted</a>. As per stats from Ampere, only 20.6 million players had played Call of Duty in March 2025. That was considerably lower than the same period in 2023, and lower still than 2024&#8217;s count of 20.8 million.&#160;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The game has continued to lose players from Steam too, dropping below 30,000 players a day in May 2025. However, some fans are seeing the positives in things, with many hoping this period spells the end of Warzone, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-leak-suggests-verdansk-is-warzones-final-shot-at-survival-3155643/">as per reports from previous leaks.&#160;</a></p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It&#8217;s good news for mp fans, they said if Verdansk doesn&#8217;t meet their goals they&#8217;ll stop making Warzone in the future,&#8221; one fan <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1kkwl8t/players_fell_despite_bo6_super_update/">claimed</a>. &#8220;Really hope Warzone can fail so we get some refocusing on the series. Who knows, maybe multiplayer can become somewhat decent,&#8221; another agreed.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Warzone really has been the bane of CoD. Every single mode is poisoned by their focus on WZ,&#8221; another added.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Some fans noted that if Warzone were to be shut down, it would only mean that hundreds of developers would lose their jobs, which isn&#8217;t exactly a positive.&#160;</p>
