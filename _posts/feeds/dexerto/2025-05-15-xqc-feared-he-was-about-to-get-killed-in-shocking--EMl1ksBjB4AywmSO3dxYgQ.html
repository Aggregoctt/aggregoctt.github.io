<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Streaming star xQc described an encounter he had with Amouranth&#8217;s husband during an outing with the influencer, saying he genuinely feared for his life.</p>

Because of these two factors, she&#8217;s been a target for violent and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/kick/amouranth-reveals-her-crazy-stalker-is-out-of-jail-and-still-harasses-her-2866337/">disturbing behavior from stalkers</a> and thieves.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In fact, her <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/exclusive-amouranth-robbery-footage-shows-moment-thieves-entered-her-room-and-demanded-money-3160691/">home was broken into</a> by three armed robbers in March 2025, who demanded access to her $20M crypto wallet after she <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/amouranth-shares-eye-popping-20m-crypto-earnings-as-bitcoin-soars-2989964/">posted about it on social media</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On top of this, Amouranth has experienced a few public falling-outs with her husband, whom she previously claimed was abusive and controlling in a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/amouranth-reveals-shes-married-and-is-being-abused-by-husband-in-concerning-twitch-stream-1959608/">bombshell live stream in 2022</a>.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">And in May 2025, the pair had an hours-long argument live on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/kick/">Kick</a> &#8212; something fellow streamer and friend to Amouranth, Felix &#8216;<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/xqc/">xQc</a>&#8216; Lengyel, addressed in a stream of his own.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In his broadcast, Lengyel expressed his sympathies for Amouranth, describing an incident where he met her husband that freaked him out so much he thought he was going to die.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to xQc, he and Amouranth were hanging out together late at night in a restaurant that wasn&#8217;t very crowded, save for themselves and their assistants.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;There are not a lot of people, it&#8217;s getting really late. And then, I swear on everything, the door opens, a guy rolls in a f**king disguise. In a f**king disguise, okay?&#8221; he said.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;He pulls up a chair at the table and he sits down, wearing this weird hat and a messenger bag, almost like a thief. He&#8217;s like, &#8216;Guys, I&#8217;m recording.&#8217; I&#8217;m like, &#8216;What the f**k?&#8217; And I swear, chat, my blood froze, and I thought I was about to get killed.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I genuinely thought I was done for. It was GGs. And it was just her husband. It was just&#8230; showing up, I guess he has her texts or her phone or her location, whatever, and the guy just pulled up from out of nowhere.&#8221;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">xQc went on to claim that Amouranth and her husband went outside the venue to argue in full view of the rest of the customers in front of a large window.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As a result, Lengyel is convinced that their viral spat in May was the real deal, although the situation has been met with speculation from viewers.</p>
