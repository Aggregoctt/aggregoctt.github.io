<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/gta-6/">GTA 6</a> is set to feature a sprawling map full of locations and activities, but fans have already spotted the first landmark in Leonida that they&#8217;re going to find. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While fans love the quirky characters and twisting story, the real star of any <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/">Grand Theft Auto</a> game is the map. These huge sandboxes offer virtually unlimited freedom and are packed with plenty of things to see, do, and most likely, blow up. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The eagerly awaited <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/where-is-gta-6-set-location-revealed-leonida-map-details-more-2414873/">GTA 6 takes place in Vice City, Leonida</a>, a fictional version of Miami, Florida. Both trailers have <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-map-locations-in-real-life-3191336/">revealed plenty of beautiful locations</a> that we&#8217;ll be visiting, but fans have spotted one landmark that&#8217;s right at the top of the bucket list. </p> 



<h2 id="h-gta-6-fans-are-eyeing-up-florida&#8217;s-tallest-landmark" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">GTA 6 fans are eyeing up Florida&#8217;s tallest landmark</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"> Following the release of Trailer 2, a large structure standing above the skyline immediately caught the eye of players. While the tall, narrow tower left some confused, others pieced together that it&#8217;s actually a television tower, likely based on the real WTVY-TV Tower. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This manmade landmark is found in Bethlehem, and at 1,901 feet, is actually the tallest structure in all of Florida. It was built in 1978 and is used to distribute WTVY-TV Channel 4 to the entire state, with its signal reaching 80 miles in every direction. </p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After spotting that a recreation of the tower will be found on the GTA 6 map, fans quickly made it clear that they want to find and climb it to soak in the surroundings of Rockstar&#8217;s newest map. Assuming that there&#8217;s a ladder to reach the top, that is.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;First thing I&#8217;m doing when the game drops is climbing to the top of it and enjoying the view,&#8221; said an excited player.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Uhhh, if we can climb that in-game, I&#8217;ll legit have a heart attack looking down lmao,&#8221; joked another. </p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Some braver players had a different idea, as they wanted to get to the top of the tower so they could jump off it &#8212; a GTA tradition. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Can you imagine how long it&#8217;ll take to get up there and how satisfying it will be to jump off?&#8221; said one reply, while another agreed: </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Can&#8217;t wait to parachute jump from there.&#8221; </p>
