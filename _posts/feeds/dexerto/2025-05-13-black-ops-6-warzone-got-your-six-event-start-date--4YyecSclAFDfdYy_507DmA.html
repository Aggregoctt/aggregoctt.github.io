<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The latest <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/">Call of Duty</a> Endowment event, Got Your Six, is coming to Black Ops 6 and Warzone, bringing plenty of free rewards for players to unlock.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Season 3 has been packed with events to get stuck into, most of which have been stoner-themed like <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-warzone-blaze-of-glory-event-3190233/">Blaze of Glory</a> and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-warzone-high-art-event-3187471/">High Art</a>. Now, with <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-season-4-update-3194203/">Season 4</a> on the horizon, the game is sobering up with the return of Call of Duty Endowment. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Got Your Six is set to be packed full of rewards, and a now-deleted trailer revealed that there&#8217;s a new Blueprint up for grabs. So, here&#8217;s everything you need to know about the event.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Got Your Six starts on <strong>Thursday, May 15, 2025</strong>, and will go live at <strong>10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM BST</strong>. It will run for two weeks and <strong>end on May 29</strong>, the same date that the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-season-4-update-3194203/">Black Ops 6</a> and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/warzone-season-4-update-3189994/">Warzone Season 4 update</a> is scheduled to arrive.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It hasn&#8217;t been confirmed how Got Your Six will work just yet, but Call of Duty events usually let players earn rewards through one of a few different methods.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The first is by simply playing matches across any mode to earn XP, with rewards being handed out at specific milestones. Sometimes, there are also items you need to pick up from defeated enemies, which can then be spent on the prizes, like the Blaze Bucks from Blaze of Glory. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There have also been events that come with specific challenges that must be completed for each reward, forcing players to adjust their play style if they want to unlock them all. In these cases, there are three different sets of objectives for BO6 multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Given that we haven&#8217;t had one for a while, and the trailer specifically mentions the &#8220;Got Your Six Challenge,&#8221; we expect it to be the latter. However, it&#8217;s also possible that they have something completely new planned, so we&#8217;ll update this page as soon as we know more. </p>  



<h2 id="h-rewards" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Rewards</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A now-deleted trailer on the CoD Endowment YouTube channel accidentally revealed the <strong>eight rewards</strong> that players will be working towards.
