<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Well, Asmongold has also weighed in with his thoughts on the game, and believes that it could win Game of the Year.</p>



<h2 id="h-asmongold-praises-clair-obscur:-expedition-33" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Asmongold praises Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This is fun, it&#8217;s been really good &#8211; I&#8217;ve been enjoying it a lot,&#8221; said Asmongold. While the streamer is still very early into his playthrough, Asmon has been impressed with the turn-based gameplay, which requires quick reactions to pull off high-damage attacks and, most notably, deadly parries.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In fact, it&#8217;s this risk vs reward system that quickly caught his attention, with the streamer noting how messing up a parry or dodge can quickly result in a party wipe.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It&#8217;s feast and famine type gameplay, where it feels really good when you do it right, and it feels awful when you do it wrong,&#8221; he explained.</p>



 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;So far, I feel like the probability of [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33] winning Game of the Year is like 90%&#8230;It&#8217;s an extremely high number&#8230;The game is great, it&#8217;s a great game, just straight up no exceptions.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Whether Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 can win GotY remains to be seen, but now that GTA 6 has been <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-officially-delayed-until-2026-3189190/">delayed</a> until May 26, 2026, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1ke021y/we_all_know_gta6_got_delayed_because_they_were/">fans believe</a> it has the best possible chance of achieving a well-earned victory.&#160;</p>
