<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Former Rockstar Games director Obbe Vermeij is hopeful that the rumors about Grand Theft Auto 4 being remastered are correct, but he does have one concern.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">2025 was supposed to be the year that Grand Theft Auto fans finally got their hands on GTA 6. However, in early May, Rockstar Games confirmed that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-officially-delayed-until-2026-3189190/">the long-awaited game had been delayed until May 26, 2026.&#160;</a></p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It hasn&#8217;t been all bad news, however. Despite the delay, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-trailer-2-finally-reveals-more-story-details-3190524/">Rockstar has revealed a second trailer for GTA 6</a>, as well as giving us<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/all-confirmed-gta-6-characters-3190548/"> some insight into the characters </a>and stories. There have also been rumors that they&#8217;re working on a GTA 4 port for modern consoles.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Noted Rockstar insider TezFun noted that the modern-day port could fill the gap in Rockstar&#8217;s release schedule and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-insider-claims-rockstar-is-set-to-release-gta-4-remaster-for-new-consoles-3194365/">drop before the end of the year.</a>&#160;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While excitement has grown, there are some fans concerned that the remaster would follow the GTA Definitive Edition and flounder. Some are worried it won&#8217;t even release as it has been talked about for a while.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Former Rockstar dev Obbe Vermeij, who worked on GTA IV, is hopeful it will drop this year. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t heard those rumours. I think GTA IV should be remastered. It&#8217;s a great game and there have been a number of successful remasters recently,&#8221; he <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1921984062358450527">posted</a> on X (formerly Twitter).</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">His only worry, though, is about the lack of variation in the missions. &#8220;GTA IV is the odd one out in the GTA series. It&#8217;s more serious. The protagonist has more depth. But yes, not much variation in the missions,&#8221; he added.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If it were to be released, Vermeij would like to see the game added to the latest edition of Rockstar&#8217;s &#8216;Rage&#8217; engine, just to get a few upgrades.</p>
