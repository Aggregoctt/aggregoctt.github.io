<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Russian government officials have decried the actions of Kick streamer Vitaly Zdorovetskiy, who is now awaiting trial in the Philippines for harassing locals during his trip in April 2025.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Russian Ambassador Marat Pavlov, the country&#8217;s top representative in Manila, addressed the incident <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/945432/moscow-envoy-tells-russians-follow-ph-laws-after-vlogger-arrest/story/">during a press conference</a> at the Russian Embassy&#8217;s Victory Day reception on May 8.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a statement to reporters, Pavlov urged Russian nationals to follow the &#8216;when in Rome, do as the Romans do&#8217; adage.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;They [Russian citizens] are obliged to be in conformity with the law of the country they are staying in,&#8221; Pavlov said.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He went on to express that most Russians visiting the Philippines are &#8220;really disciplined,&#8221; and admitted that he hoped that they wouldn&#8217;t face discrimination in the country due to the actions of one bad apple.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Pavolv also urged law enforcement to handle any future cases &#8220;discreetly,&#8221; as opposed to the highly-publicized case surrounding Vitaly.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It should be put and resolved in a quiet manner without so many publicity, that is my view,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now, the streamer is <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/kick/vitalty-trapped-behind-bars-in-philippines-for-3-years-in-shared-cell-with-no-ac-3178188/">awaiting trial in a shared cell</a>, going without air conditioning in 97-degree heat and eating the same cheap meals every day.</p>
