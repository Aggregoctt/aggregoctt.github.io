<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Following the discovery of wall running hidden in the Black Ops 6 files, dataminers have now found jetpacks, leaving players fearing that the feature might return in COD 2025.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One of the most controversial periods of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/">Call of Duty</a> history was the jetpack era from 2014 to 2016, where the series swapped realism for futuristic gameplay, where players could soar through the air. While there were some beloved games during this time, particularly Black Ops 3, many welcomed the return of boots-on-the-ground action in 2017&#8217;s WWII. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/black-ops-6/">Black Ops 6</a> cranked up the mobility once again with the addition of omnimovement, which is expected to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-dev-addresses-whether-omnimovement-will-be-used-in-future-cods-3006834/">become a staple of the franchise going forward</a>, especially in future Black Ops games. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This includes <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-2025-details-2439485/">COD 2025</a>, which is reportedly set to be a Black Ops 2 sequel. However, the game might feature more focus on movement than first thought, as dataminers have now found jetpacks in the Black Ops 6 files. </p>



<h2 id="h-jetpacks-found-in-black-ops-6-files" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Jetpacks found in Black Ops 6 files</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Previous leaks have suggested that COD 2025 will allow wall running, so when <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-leak-uncovers-wall-running-and-it-could-return-in-cod-2025-3197048/">leakers saw that the feature had been added to the BO6 files</a> in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-season-3-reloaded-update-3181583/">Season 3 Reloaded</a>, it was assumed that the devs were testing it out for the upcoming game. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now, though, dataminers like &#8216;Bikou&#8217; have also discovered a double jump, just like previous jetpack CODs. Videos posted on social media show players able to essentially perform a double jump in mid-air, and chain the trick together with wall running for incredible mobility.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It looks very reminiscent of the movement from games like Black Ops 3, which featured maps that relied heavily on the jetpacks to reach crucial spots. </p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The real question is why the feature has been added to the Black Ops 6 files. Some have speculated that there could be an in-game event coming that uses jetpacks and wall running, while others think it&#8217;s more likely that they&#8217;re being tested for COD 2025. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If the latter turns out to be true, players are pretty divided about the prospect of another jetpack Call of Duty. &#8220;F**k the haters this gonna be amazing,&#8221; said one happy player, while another agreed: &#8220;I hope it&#8217;s for the next cod, we need a jet pack cod, boots on the ground is boring.&#8221; </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Meanwhile, others were less optimistic. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This will ruin the game,&#8221; argued one fan, before another added: &#8220;And this is when the game TRULY dies. I&#8217;ll see y&#8217;all in MW4 in 2026.&#8221; </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s also worth noting that previous leaks have revealed that the next Call of Duty will bring remasters of every Black Ops 2 map, which didn&#8217;t feature jetpacks back in 2012. So, if wall running and double jumping are returning, the maps would likely have to be adjusted to accommodate the extra mobility. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Of course, this is all just speculation until Activision confirms what Call of Duty 2025 looks like and why exactly these features have been snuck into the BO6 files. </p>
