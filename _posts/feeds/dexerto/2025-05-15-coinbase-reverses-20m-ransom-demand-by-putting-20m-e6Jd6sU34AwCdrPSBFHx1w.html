<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has responded to a $20 million ransom demand from cyber criminals by using that money to place a bounty on the thieves instead.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/esports/team-liquid-secure-major-coinbase-sponsorship-in-latest-crypto-esports-deal-1695821/">Coinbase</a> has refused to negotiate with the cyber-thieves after they threatened to release customer information.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 15, Coinbase <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.coinbase.com/en-ca/blog/protecting-our-customers-standing-up-to-extortionists">revealed</a> that overseas agents had allegedly been bribed to steal customer data including names, emails, government ID images, phone numbers and addresses.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Although login credentials weren&#8217;t stolen and customer funds were safe, with the information acquired, the alleged thieves could trick unsuspecting users into giving up their <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/crypto/">Crypto</a> by pretending to be Coinbase through social engineering attacks.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The attackers demanded $20 million in Bitcoin in exchange for not releasing the data, but instead of paying, Coinbase is going on the offensive.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Coinbase says it will reimburse anyone affected by the attacks and will be using the $20 million the thieves demanded as a reward leading to their arrest.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to the company&#8217;s CEO Brian Armstrong, less than one percent of Coinbase&#8217;s monthly active users were affected, but that won&#8217;t stop them from seeking justice.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This is still unacceptable,&#8221; he said in a video posted to X. &#8220;Instead of paying the $20M ransom, we&#8217;re turning it around. We&#8217;re putting out a $20M reward for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of these attackers.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;For these would-be extortionists or anyone seeking to harm Coinbase customers, know that we will prosecute you and bring you to justice.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Furthermore, Coinbase is working closely with law enforcement to pursue the harshest penalties possible. Anyone with information is urged to contact security@coinbase.com.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This is not the first time crypto thieves have made headlines. Back in 2023, Cryptocurrency Platypus was hit by a targeted attack that saw the newly launched stablecoin get <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tech/10-day-old-cryptocurrency-exploited-for-8-5-million-2064061/">exploited for $8.5 million</a>.</p>
