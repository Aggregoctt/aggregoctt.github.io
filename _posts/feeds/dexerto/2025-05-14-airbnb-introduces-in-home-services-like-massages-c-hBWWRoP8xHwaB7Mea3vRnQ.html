<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Airbnb is branching out from its status as a property rental company to offer an entirely new set of services, including everything from personal trainers to massage therapists.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Airbnb has come a long way from its <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://news.airbnb.com/about-us/#:~:text=October%202007,app%20and%20Instant%20Book%20feature.">humble beginnings in 2007</a>. Since then, it&#8217;s become one of the most popular ways for vacationers to book their holiday getaways in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.rubyhome.com/blog/airbnb-stats/#:~:text=Airbnb%20has%20over%207%20million,since%20it%20started%20in%202007.">220 countries</a> around the world.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over a decade later, Airbnb is now making a big switch from its usual fare in an effort to compete with major hotel chains.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 13, 2025, the company revealed that it is now offering the option for users to rent out a bevy of private services to complement their holidays. These include: Chefs, photographers, massage therapists, spa treatments, personal training, hair stylists, makeup artists, nail technicians, pre-prepped meals and even catering.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;People choose hotels for their services. People choose Airbnbs for the space&#8230; now, we&#8217;re giving you the best of both worlds,&#8221; Airbnb&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky said in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://news.airbnb.com/en-uk/2025-summer-release-now-you-can-airbnb-more-than-an-airbnb/">an official statement</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Now, we&#8217;re giving you the best of both worlds&#8212;amazing homes with services that make them even more special.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Airbnb assured users that its services are &#8220;vetted for quality through an evaluation of expertise and reputation,&#8221; stating they have an &#8220;average of 10 years of experience, have completed Airbnb&#8217;s identity verification process, and are required to submit relevant licenses and certifications.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In fact, the company boasted that some of these professionals are stars in their respective fields, citing &#8220;Michelin-starred restaurants, award-winning photographers, and elite trainers&#8221; as examples.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That being said, not all of these services will be costly; Airbnb promises that they&#8217;re available at &#8220;nearly every price,&#8221; some with a special entry fee of less than $50.</p>



<h2 id="h-users-skeptical-after-airbnb-reveals-new-in-home-services" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Users skeptical after Airbnb reveals new in-home services</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The company is also rolling out a new version of its mobile app alongside another fresh feature for future vacationers in the form of Airbnb Experiences, which are essentially travel packages in the vein of museum tours, art workshops, and cooking classes.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Responses to Airbnb&#8217;s latest offerings are largely mixed; many users on social media are skeptical of these changes, with some worrying about <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/Ac7ionMann/status/1922701022574653548">racking up additional fees</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Still, others raised eyebrows over the inclusion of personal massages, with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/CryptoStonerfam/status/1922703197119889726">one writing</a> on X: &#8220;Bruh, that&#8217;s about to get weird.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This definitely won&#8217;t be abused,&#8221; <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/DrinkerOfTears/status/1922714446884999246">another remarked</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While Airbnb assured that these services are fully vetted, that isn&#8217;t stopping users from holding it at arms&#8217; length for now. However, for those who are interested, both Airbnb Services and Experiences are now available on the app.</p>
