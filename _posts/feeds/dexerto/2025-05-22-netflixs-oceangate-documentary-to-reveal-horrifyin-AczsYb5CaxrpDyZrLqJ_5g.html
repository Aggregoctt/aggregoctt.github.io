<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the early morning of Sunday, June 18, 2023, the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/how-to-watch-oceangate-titan-sub-documentary-2562673/">Titan submersible</a> began its descent into the depths of the North Atlantic Ocean in a bid to explore the Titanic wreck. Less than two hours later, it lost communication with its mothership &#8211; and it never resurfaced.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After days of searching, the vessel was found to have imploded from the pressure of the surrounding waters, killing all five passengers on board: Shahzada Dawood, his son Suleman Dawood, Paul-Henri Nargeolet, Hamish Harding, and Stockton.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/movie-about-oceangate-titanic-sub-tragedy-happening-2315868/">Conspiracy theories</a> about what had happened to the sub soon shifted focus to the terrifying conditions on board, but even now there are many questions left unanswered. Filmmaker Mark Monroe is hoping to fill in the gaps with his <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/shocking-netflix-documentaries-2890798/">Netflix documentary</a>.&#160;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">By examining Stockton Rush&#8217;s desire to be the next billionaire innovator no matter the cost, Titan: The OceanGate Disaster is set to highlight a terrifying truth: that the incident was completely avoidable.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking to Netflix&#8217;s Tudum, Monroe said, &#8220;When the Titan submersible went missing, I was horrified and mesmerized by the 24/7 news coverage and global social commentary &#8211; just like the rest of the world.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, the filmmaker pointed out that &#8220;there was no context for what could have happened to those onboard, and the only touchpoint was the Titanic, a story that&#8217;s now become a grim fairy tale.&#8221;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The more I dug into this terrible tragedy, the more intrigued I became about how this could have ever happened in the first place, and who exactly was the man who built and then went down with this ship,&#8221; Monroe continued.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We hope that this film can help provide answers to these very questions.&#8221;</p> 



<h2 id="h-titan:-the-oceangate-disaster-to-feature-whistleblower-testimony" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Titan: The OceanGate Disaster to feature whistleblower testimony</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">What made the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/james-cameron-shuts-down-offensive-rumors-of-an-oceangate-submersible-film-2213255/">OceanGate disaster</a> especially chilling wasn&#8217;t just the loss of life, but the details that followed, revealing it was doomed from the start &#8211; not that the passengers ever knew.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Titan sub was controlled by a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tech/missing-oceangate-titan-uses-an-old-game-controller-2182964/">modified video game controller</a>, had limited emergency systems, and lacked certification from any recognized safety authority.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The interior was cramped, bolted shut from the outside, and constructed from carbon fiber, an experimental material that experts had repeatedly warned could fail under deep-sea pressure.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Each passenger had paid $250,000 for the voyage &#8211; a staggering fee for a journey that ended in tragedy. Now, Netflix&#8217;s documentary promises to go beyond the headlines for the first time, and bring long-overdue clarity to what really happened.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As per Netflix, &#8220;Through exclusive access to whistleblower testimony, pivotal audio recordings, and footage from the company&#8217;s early days, the film provides an unprecedented look at the technical challenges, moral dilemmas, and shockingly poor decisions that culminated in the catastrophic expedition.&#8221;</p> 



<h2 id="h-oceangate-ceo-stockton-rush-called-&#8220;psychopath&#8221;-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush called &#8220;psychopath&#8221;&#160;</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s also set to lift the lid on Stockton Rush, with former employees speaking about the working environment. In the new trailer, one talking head says, &#8220;He wanted fame. To fuel his ego, fame.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I thought Stockton was a borderline psychopath,&#8221; states another. &#8220;How do you manage a person like that, who owns the company?&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Following the disaster, OceanGate was under deeper scrutiny than ever. The firm ultimately stopped all operations following investigations into the incident. But by this point, it was too late. Stockton and all the passengers died, and there&#8217;s no way to reverse what happened.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Monroe went on to say that the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/new-documentaries-true-crime-netflix-hulu-prime-streaming-2271621/">new documentary</a> &#8220;critiques a segment of society who believe the rules don&#8217;t apply to them, and feel well within their rights to break them in the name of something greater.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The greatest tragedy, and what I hope audiences come to understand, is how this disaster was completely avoidable.&#8221;</p>
