<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Hideo Kojima plans to punish players who take long breaks by making the protagonist forget vital skills. No grind, no glory.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Known as a gaming innovator, Kojima has long pushed boundaries. Yet, he recently admitted he&#8217;s bored with the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hideo-kojima-actually-wishes-death-stranding-2-was-more-controversial-3196005/">&#8220;praise parade&#8221; around Death Stranding 2</a>. He craves controversy instead, something to shake up his audience and spark debate.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Maybe it&#8217;s that sentiment that pushed him to come up with an undoubtedly controversial idea for a game mechanic: forgetting.</p> 



<h2 id="h-kojima&#8217;s-next-game-could-implement-the-&#8220;forgetting&#8221;-feature" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Kojima&#8217;s next game could implement the &#8220;Forgetting&#8221; feature</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRQeB2a-RSs&amp;t=2191s">Episode 17 of his KOJI10 radio podcast</a>, he explained this concept. Basically, the protagonist slowly forgets how to shoot or even their job if you take too long a break. &#8220;Players would have to take a week off work or school to play it,&#8221; Kojima joked. The game would demand constant attention or suffer the consequences.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Kojima&#8217;s knack for weaving real-time mechanics into gameplay is legendary.&#160;&#160;In fact, he already explored something very similar in 2004, when he released Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In this game, food would spoil in real life, forcing players to eat carefully. Spoiled food could even sicken the protagonist or be thrown at enemies.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He also came up with The End boss fight, an encounter that could be entirely skipped if you waited a week in real life before facing him because he&#8217;d die of old age. We&#8217;re sure these ideas wowed fans but frustrated those who couldn&#8217;t play daily.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He&#8217;s also famous for breaking the fourth wall. The Psycho Mantis fight in the original Metal Gear Solid made players physically swap controller ports to dodge psychic attacks.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fans can look forward to Death Stranding 2, slated for release in 2025. The hype is real, but with Kojima, expect the unexpected, and maybe a little punishment if you ghost the game.</p>
