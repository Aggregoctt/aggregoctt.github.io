<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Screw you guys, I&#8217;m going to be a South Park character!&#8221; If you want to say this to your friends, now you have a chance, as <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/south-park-trey-parker-matt-stone-wish-delete-three-seasons-2491853/">Trey Parker and Matt Stone&#8217;s</a> long-running series is currently taking applications.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Any &#8216;90s kid reading this will have grown up in tandem with <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/south-park/">South Park</a>. What started as a crude, foul-mouthed show built on shock value gradually became a biting satirical powerhouse, skewering everything from politics to pop culture.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Parker and Stone&#8217;s creation is now known as one of the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-animated-series-2977301/">best animated series</a> of all time, and 28 years later, it&#8217;s still going strong. The only downside is due to its multi-platform deal, the last time we got new episodes (other than the 2024 special) was in 2023.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, this is set to change, with Season 27 premiering on July 9, 2025, on Comedy Central and Paramount+. Until then, fans can celebrate by getting involved in a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-south-park-episodes-2606066/">South Park</a> first competition.&#160;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">South Park has teamed up with online fundraising platform Prizeo to launch a new competition that will allow one lucky winner to be a permanent character on the show in Season 27.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">To be in with a chance, you&#8217;ll need to give a donation, the proceeds of which will go to the SoCal Fire Fund, which supports community-centered recovery initiatives that help students, school employees, and families impacted by the LA fires.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The more you donate, the more entries you get. So, if you pay $50, you get 600 entries, and if you donate $100, you get 1,000. The winner will be animated into a custom South Park character and appear in the new 2025 season, while also having their character featured in a poster with Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The listing features a note from the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-animated-movies-2569318/">animated</a> series, which reads, &#8220;All new episodes of South Park will premiere on July 9 and you can become a permanent character in the series!</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We are proud to partner with Charitybuzz to help those affected by the wildfires that devastated Los Angeles earlier this year.&#160;</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;A majority of our crew and the South Park production studio are in Los Angeles and several people were directly impacted by the fires in Pasadena, Altadena, and Palisades, which makes your support and donations even more meaningful.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This cause means a lot to us &#8211; and so do the fans who have supported us all these years. We can&#8217;t wait to see one of you in the show&#8230; Thank you for your generous donations!&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you&#8217;re interested, just head to the listing <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.prizeo.com/campaigns/l/south-park/get-animated-into-south-park-2025">here</a> and pick which option you&#8217;d like to go for. The entry process will run from now until June 27, with the winner then selected at random and told via email.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Imagine if that one person was you? That&#8217;d be pretty killer weak sweet.</p>
