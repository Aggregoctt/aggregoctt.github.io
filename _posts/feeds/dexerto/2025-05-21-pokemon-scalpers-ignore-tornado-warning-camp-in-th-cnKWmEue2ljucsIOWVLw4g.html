<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Pokemon scalpers were reportedly camping outside a store to secure cards despite being in the midst of awful weather and even getting a thunderstorm warning.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Collecting Pokemon cards is supposed to be a fun and affordable hobby that fans of all ages can enjoy. Though thanks to scalpers going out of their way to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/pokemon-tcg-players-left-empty-handed-as-scalpers-clear-targets-black-friday-sale-2989877/">clear out shelves</a> in the blink of an eye, this has not been the case for a long time now.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;ve seen some truly crazy incidents regarding this issue throughout the years. If a vending machine queue leading to a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/pokemon-card-scalpers-go-viral-after-fight-breaks-out-over-vending-machine-restock-3157906/">fight breaking out in public</a> isn&#8217;t wild enough, someone out there went as far as <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/pokemon-tcg-scalper-follows-employee-to-multiple-stores-to-buy-restocked-cards-3143238/">following an employee</a> from store to store to get restocked cards.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Following the release of the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-premium-box-revealed-but-dont-get-your-hopes-up-3147259/">Prismatic Evolutions Super-Premium Collection</a>, though, it&#8217;s clear that things just got even worse. First spotted by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/600017/gamestop-pokemon-tcg-scalpers-tornado-warning-reddit">Polygon</a>, scalpers would seemingly rather keep their spot in line and possibly put themselves in danger than listen to a tornado warning.</p> 



<h2 id="h-pokemon-scalpers-go-out-of-their-way-to-camp-in-the-middle-of-&#8220;awful&#8221;-weather" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Pokemon scalpers go out of their way to camp in the middle of &#8220;awful&#8221; weather</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1knzzbv/jerks/">Reddit thread</a>, one user expressed their frustrating experience when they wanted to get the new Prismatic set. &#8220;I decided to try and wait for the new prismatic super premium collection for a midnight release,&#8221; they explained.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Despite already planning to do so, things didn&#8217;t go smoothly for them. Not only was the weather for the night &#8220;awful,&#8221; but they claimed that there was a &#8220;tornado warning&#8221; and &#8220;thunderstorms until around 2:30 AM.&#8221;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Much to their surprise, though, despite that being the case, they spotted two people already camping in the store when they got there at 3 AM.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Upon speaking with them, they found out that these people had apparently been waiting in this location since the day before, which is no doubt surprising considering the weather situation.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ultimately, they were left upset because these people said, &#8220;Sorry, but we are getting all of it, you can&#8217;t get any,&#8221; while having a trunk loaded with Pokemon stuff, including a Charizard Ultra Premium Collection.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This is just one of the many shenanigans scalpers have done lately. In a separate thread, another user even <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1kp85gh/lmao_people_been_camping_since_2_days_lmao/">shared</a> a picture of one particular Gamestop that can be seen flooded with people trying to get in to secure their goods.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Either way, it&#8217;s clear that these types of people aren&#8217;t backing off and giving others a chance anytime soon, as some of them are willing to go to the extreme just to make a quick buck off Pokemon cards.</p>
