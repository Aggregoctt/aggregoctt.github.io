<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Activision has confirmed that Call of Duty: Warzone&#8217;s mobile port will no longer get support or additional updates from the company. Servers will stay up for now, but it&#8217;s only a matter of time until they get taken down.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/call-of-duty-mobile/">CoD Mobile</a> is wildly popular globally, making up a huge portion of Activision&#8217;s total profit on the franchise. It&#8217;s been a huge money maker for the company. However, the Warzone port hasn&#8217;t seen anywhere near the same success.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With the mobile market for Battle Royales already saturated with games like Garena: Free Fire, PUBG Mobile, and Fortnite in countries where mobile BRs are incredibly popular, Activision&#8217;s take on the genre ultimately failed to make a big enough mark to be worth keeping alive.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As a result, they&#8217;re cutting their losses now and moving on to other things.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-mobile&#8217;s-dev-team-is-moving-on" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Warzone Mobile&#8217;s dev team is moving on</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The team behind Warzone Mobile revealed that they&#8217;re effectively shutting down the game, making it so that players can&#8217;t spend money on it anymore. And, while cross-progression and shared inventory with the core version of Warzone still exists, there&#8217;s no way to refund content.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Refunds are not available for previously purchased in-game content or unused COD Points. However, you can continue to enjoy the content if you have the game installed before May 19, 2025.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In other words, if you bought a Warzone mobile-exclusive Operator or weapon skin, you&#8217;re out of luck. And, for those who don&#8217;t re-install before May 19, the game will be inaccessible forever despite being released on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/cod-warzone-mobile-everything-we-know-1573642/">March 21, 2024</a>, just over a year ago at the time of writing.</p>  


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This decision was made after careful consideration of various factors and while we&#8217;re proud of the accomplishment in bringing Call of Duty: Warzone to mobile in an authentic way, it unfortunately has not met our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences,&#8221; <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes">the developers explained</a> in their reasoning for winding down support for this title.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Warzone Mobile&#8217;s development team told Dexerto that they&#8217;re already moving on to other things, saying: &#8220;Our teams are busy and already moving forward on a variety of work.&#8221; What is that work exactly? Hard to say.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">CoD Mobile actually has an entirely different development team handling it that&#8217;s separate from this one, a Tencent-owned studio by the name of Timi. So, it&#8217;s likely that the people who were working on this version of Warzone aren&#8217;t moving on to that project.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, if you never tried Warzone Mobile and want to give the game a go before it&#8217;s gone forever, you&#8217;ll want to get it on your phone before May 19 comes around.</p>
