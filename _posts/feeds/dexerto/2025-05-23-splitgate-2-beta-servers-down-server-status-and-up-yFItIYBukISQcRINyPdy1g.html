<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This beta is essentially the game&#8217;s launch, as it&#8217;ll stay live right up until the official release in the near future, and you&#8217;ll keep all your progression.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, server issues have meant that players haven&#8217;t been able to find games and have found themselves up against bots rather than real players. If you&#8217;re desperate to play the new shooter, here are all the latest updates on Splitgate 2&#8217;s server status. </p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>The Splitgate 2 servers have been taken offline</strong> while the devs work to fix the issues stopping players from loading into games.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At 8 PM PT on May 22, roughly 11 hours after the beta went live, the devs said, &#8220;We are taking servers offline temporarily to implement some important bug fixes and stability improvements. We are continuing to work around the clock to get things as stable as possible.&#8221;</p> 



 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We are still working on some critical backend fixes. We hope to get this fixed in the morning,&#8221; said one of the devs in the Splitgate 2 Discord at 1:46 AM PT on May 23.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Will keep everyone posted but just know that the backend team is working extremely hard to get things as stable as possible.&#8221;&#160;</p>
