<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Two British tourists in Japan have been rescued after they attempted to climb Mount Yotei, the titular mountain featured in Sucker Punch Productions&#8217; samurai epic &#8212; <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/ghost-of-yotei-2909932/">Ghost of Yotei</a>.&#160;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The snow-capped mountain is heavily featured in Ghost of Yotei, often appearing in official artwork and the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://youtu.be/7z7kqwuf0a8?si=_y-5VBhF5IjvoSgy">reveal trailer</a>. Mount Yotei is one of the 100 famous mountains in Japan, and is often noted for having striking visual similarities to Mount Fuji. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While it&#8217;s much smaller than its 3,776-meter cousin, Yotei is known for its snowy conditions, with temperatures remaining cool even during the summer months.&#160;As you can imagine, this makes it particularly dangerous for unprepared hikers. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Well, this is exactly what happened when a British couple had to be rescued by a police helicopter after they could no longer climb due to the cold.&#160;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to the authorities, both were lightly dressed, with the man wearing long sleeves and shorts, and the woman in short sleeves and long pants.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A translated report from <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.uhb.jp/news/single.html?id=50744">UHB</a> explains how the couple called the authorities at around 6:10 pm on May 13, after they were unable to find shelter from the cold. Both were eventually rescued an hour later by a Hokkaido Prefectural Police helicopter, which landed at Yotei&#8217;s ninth station &#8212; a rest stop around 1,750m above sea level and the last station before the summit.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Police mentioned that the couple had &#8220;no knowledge or experience&#8221; of mountain climbing and were unprepared for the 1,898-meter hike. While both received no injuries, the woman was taken to the hospital, but her symptoms were mild, and she didn&#8217;t receive treatment.&#160;</p>
