<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">YouTuber <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/linus-tech-tips/">Linus Tech Tips</a> spent a ludicrous amount of money to break the Guinness World Record for most digits of Pi calculated by a computer. Not only did he beat the record, he completely shattered it.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Linus&#8217; previous calculating world record was 32 million digits of Pi calculated in 30 minutes. Meanwhile, the standing record was just over 200 trillion.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, in order to beat this record, he&#8217;d need some major upgrades &#8211; but not in the places you&#8217;d think. Raw computing power wasn&#8217;t the issue, or at least not fully.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">What was the reason he needed $1 million worth of parts to make this work and achieve a world record? As it turns out, he needed storage. A lot of it.</p>



<h2 id="h-linus-tech-tips-shatters-pi-calculation-world-record" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Linus Tech Tips shatters Pi calculation world record</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">You&#8217;d think that storing a basic number calculation on a document would be easy, and you&#8217;d be right! Numbers on a page take up very little space on a drive. At the point that you get to trillions of numbers, though, things get a little hairy.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In order to fit the full calculation for Pi that Linus wanted to do, he&#8217;d need 11.7 billion pages worth of number storage to pull off the feat. So, he built a server farm with enough data storage to keep track of the calculation.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With 2.2 petabytes of storage, around 2,200 terabytes of lightning-fast storage, he was able to achieve the record. That&#8217;s where the real expense came in along with the server setup and raw computing power to get through the sheer amount of calculations they&#8217;d have to do.</p>  


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s a lot more to it than that, with them also turning a server rack into a dual-CPU setup that can transmit over 100 GB of data per second. This is at a level beyond even what <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/google/">Google</a>&#8216;s cloud servers are capable of.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The calculation took 190 days and was sustained through multiple power outages and the cooling for their server room failing, but, after months of it running and around $6300 USD in power consumption costs, the record was broken.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Linus and co-host Jake don&#8217;t think the record will stand for very long, but, for now, it&#8217;s theirs.</p>
