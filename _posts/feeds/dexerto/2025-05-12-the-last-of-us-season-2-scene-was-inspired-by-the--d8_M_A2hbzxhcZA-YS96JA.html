<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/the-last-of-us/">The Last of Us&#8217;</a> influences are clear; its devastated landscape evokes the work of Cormac McCarthy, its terrifying infected run and flail like the rage-induced zombies of 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead (the remake), and its dystopian future is similar to Children of Men. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The HBO show has also hidden sneakier Easter eggs and references. For example, Joel protecting Ellie, Henry, and Sam from Kathleen, the Hunters, and the horde of infected was inspired by Saving Private Ryan. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In Episode 5, Ellie and Dina come across a clump of dead bodies on the streets of Seattle. It&#8217;s a horrible image &#8211; with ties to an even more upsetting film.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Near the beginning of Episode 5, Ellie and Dina leave the theater and make their way to Lakehill Hospital. They find the bloodied, fly-buzzing corpses of Seraphites under a &#8220;Feel Her Love&#8221; mural, with the added words, &#8220;Feel this, b*tch.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5hZ5tR1GDvdOd4vItt84oI?si=1b296648e3174dd3">The Last of Us podcast</a>, Craig Mazin revealed this scene was inspired by Come and See, Elem Klimov&#8217;s iconic (and infamous) 1985 film (which happens to be the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-war-movies-2197886/">best war movie of all time</a>). </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This tableau is inspired by a movie I have gone back to over and over and over again, it was something I studied lengthily with Johan Renck when we made Chernobyl. It is Come and See, which is a Russian war film,&#8221; he explained. </p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It is the greatest war movie that has ever been made. It&#8217;s an incredible piece of work, and there is a moment that is very forwardly quoting from, the way that these bodies are arranged against that wall.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;One thing that I thought was important was to show&#8230; this is like, &#8216;Great, you wanna tag the wall? We&#8217;ll tag the wall&#8230; we&#8217;ll tag the wall with your bodies, and then we&#8217;ll write this.&#8217; They&#8217;re leaving each other messages.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Without getting into too many spoilers, there is a moment in Come and See where two children go to a seemingly empty village &#8211; but as they leave, they see the pile of its executed residents behind a house. This is the reference point for the &#8220;Feel Her Love&#8221; scene in The Last of Us. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you haven&#8217;t seen Come and See, it&#8217;s available to stream via The Criterion Channel or you can rent or buy it digitally on Amazon Prime and other on-demand platforms.</p>
