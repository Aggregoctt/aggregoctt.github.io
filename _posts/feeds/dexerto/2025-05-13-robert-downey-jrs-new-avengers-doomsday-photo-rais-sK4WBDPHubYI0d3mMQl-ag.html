<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Robert Downey Jr. has posted a new photo from the set of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/avengers-the-kang-dynasty-release-date-cast-plot-more-1949725/">Avengers: Doomsday</a>, and one tiny detail has left fans concerned about what his Doctor Doom may end up looking like. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It was the casting announcement nobody expected: in July 2024, Downey returned to Hall H at SDCC and unveiled himself as the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/marvel/">MCU&#8217;s</a> Doctor Doom, five years after his iconic exit in Endgame. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Filming is underway for Doomsday, the first of a star-studded blockbuster two-hander before <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/avengers-secret-wars-release-date-cast-plot-more-1950442/">Secret Wars</a> inevitably brings everybody back.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s little we actually know about how Doctor Doom will come into the Marvel Cinematic Universe; will he come from Latveria, will there be a reason he looks like Tony Stark, is he from the multiverse? Now, fans have another question&#8230; and it&#8217;s about his mask. </p>



<h2 id="h-robert-downey-jr-leaves-fans-worried-about-doctor-doom&#8217;s-mask-in-avengers:-doomsday" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Robert Downey Jr leaves fans worried about Doctor Doom&#8217;s mask in Avengers: Doomsday</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In Downey&#8217;s photo, you can see motion dots on his face, used to help VFX artists track an actor&#8217;s movements when they&#8217;re implementing CGI. There&#8217;s a chance this could be for Victor Von Doom&#8217;s scars, but fans suspect it could be for his mask. </p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">CGI masks have become increasingly common in the MCU; Sam Wilson&#8217;s helmet in Brave New World, Iron Man&#8217;s later suits, and all of the Endgame suits were made with nano-tech. It&#8217;s possible &#8211; given Stark pioneered nano-tech &#8211; that his Doom variant would use the same technology for his mask and suit. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;They are gonna CGI the f**king mask,&#8221; one user <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/aryanp_000/status/1922293022198264225">tweeted</a>. &#8220;Muscle suit, grey hair, and minimal mo-cap dots on his face? Now I&#8217;m even more confused what direction they&#8217;re going with for Doom,&#8221; another <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/jonnbridges/status/1922292897921028380">wrote</a>.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Russo Brothers have kept their cards close to their chests regarding Downey&#8217;s involvement in Doomsday. Speaking to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.etonline.com/media/videos/russo-brothers-millie-bobby-brown-is-on-dream-cast-list-for-every-project-as-they-make">ET</a>, the directors said: &#8220;It&#8217;s a very intense process developing the character.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;He&#8217;s so immersed in it. He is so dialed in&#8230; that&#8217;s the kind of artist he is. That&#8217;s the kind of actor he is.&#8221;</p>
