<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 21, 2025, Cuffem was arrested by authorities in Tift County, Georgia. He seemingly went live on Instagram after being released the following day in a stream titled, &#8216;Just got out of jail.&#8217;</p>

I was in jail for eight f**king hours, sitting in that cell of doom,&#8221; he said in the stream, claiming that no one was available to pick him up at the time.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, other screenshots from the website posted on social media show that he was released on a bond of $1,750. He was allegedly charged with speeding 100 miles in a 70 mph zone, as well as reckless driving &#8212; both misdemeanor charges.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This wouldn&#8217;t be Cuffem&#8217;s first time getting in trouble with the law for driving too fast on the road. In 2024, the streamer made headlines after being <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/news-kick-streamer-cuffem-gets-pulled-allegedly-street-racing-later-gets-hit-vehicle">pulled over for speeding</a> in his Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Thus far, Cuffem hasn&#8217;t made any public statements about his latest arrest aside from his Instagram live stream, leaving viewers equal parts concerned and exasperated.</p>
