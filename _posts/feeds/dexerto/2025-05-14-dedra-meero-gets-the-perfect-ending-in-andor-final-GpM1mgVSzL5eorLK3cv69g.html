<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Dedra Meero was the chief antagonist for much of Andor, so here&#8217;s how her story concludes, and why it&#8217;s the perfect ending for the character.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Dedra Meero is one of the most fascinating new figures in the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> universe. Born on Coruscant, and raised in an Imperial Kinder-block, her loyalty to the Empire is unwavering.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But over the course of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/andor/">Andor</a> Seasons 1 and 2, she becomes frustrated with her superiors at the Imperial Security Bureau, who don&#8217;t take Dedra&#8217;s warnings about the threat of the Rebellion seriously.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">She also falls for the unusual charms of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/andor-season-2-syril-death-was-nearly-very-different-3190983/">Syril Karn</a>, and those feelings seem increasingly likely to cloud her judgment. Dedra&#8217;s story builds to a powerful climax, that ends with Meero exactly where she should be. <strong>SPOILERS</strong> ahead&#8230;</p>



<h2 id="h-andor-showrunner-says-dedra-meero-&#8220;had-to-go-down&#8221;-in-finale" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Andor showrunner says Dedra Meero &#8220;had to go down&#8221; in finale</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Dedra Meero&#8217;s obsession with Luthen Rael peaks when she realises exactly who he is and where he&#8217;s working, as well as the fact that one of his undercover agents is working alongside her.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Meero decides the time is right to arrest Luthen, but takes that action with alerting her ISB superiors, and approaches him alone. That mistake gives Rael the time and opportunity to stab himself in the stomach, and he&#8217;s ultimately murdered in hospital, before Luthen can reveal the Rebellion&#8217;s knowledge and secrets.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s a catalogue of errors, that doesn&#8217;t sit well with Director Krennic, and results in Meero being sent to Nakrina, an Imperial prison like the one in which Cassian himself was previously incarcerated, as well as the location for some of Andor&#8217;s very best scenes.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking to Deadline about her fate, showrunner Tony Gilroy <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/andor-season-2-finale-tony-gilroy-1236387522/">says</a>: &#8220;She completely screwed up. I mean, by the time Krennic gets done with her, the whole ISB is coming apart. Partagaz has to kill himself. He commits seppuku on the conference room. They have really sh*t the bed there in every way. She&#8217;s lucky she&#8217;s not dead, but she&#8217;s in Narkina.&#8221;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">During an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Gilroy <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/andor-finale-twists-tony-gilroy-interview-1236212162/">discussed</a> the larger implications of her errors: &#8220;The whole ISB is coming to an end. If you think about it, if that was the CIA or any intelligence bureau, with those kind of breaches and that kind of disaster happening simultaneously, it would be a cleaning of house. So she&#8217;s definitely going to go down.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Then speaking of the poetic justice in Meero crying alone in an Imperial cell at the very end of the series, Gilroy adds: &#8220;To have her on Narkina 3 or Narkina 9 or wherever she&#8217;s on&#8230; I mean, that was just too juicy to ignore.&#8221;</p>
