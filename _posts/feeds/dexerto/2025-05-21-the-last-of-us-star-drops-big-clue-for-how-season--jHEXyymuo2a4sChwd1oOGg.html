<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-3176859/">The Last of Us Season 2</a> finale airs this weekend, and one of the show&#8217;s stars has just given fans of the game a big clue about where in the story it&#8217;ll end. Spoilers to follow&#8230;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Last week&#8217;s episode of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/the-last-of-us/">The Last of Us</a> focused on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-2-just-made-its-biggest-joel-ellie-mistake-in-episode-6-3196665/">Joel and Ellie</a> and how their relationship fell apart before the events of Season 2. However, it ended on an ominous note: Ellie standing outside the theater in the pouring rain, presumably after torturing Nora. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, what will happen in the finale? If Ellie got information about Abby&#8217;s whereabouts &#8211; which the trailer seems to suggest with her mysterious boat ride &#8211; she&#8217;ll go after her, and we may even get to see Tommy again. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ever since Ellie and Dina arrived in Seattle, the show has been barreling towards one of the game&#8217;s most shocking moments (though not as gut-wrenching as <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-is-joel-dead-3182624/">Joel&#8217;s death</a>). This could be the break-off point before Season 3. Game spoilers ahead&#8230;</p> 



<h2 id="h-the-last-of-us-star-confirms-main-focus-of-season-3-before-season-2-finale" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">The Last of Us star confirms main focus of Season 3 before Season 2 finale</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to Catherine O&#8217;Hara, who plays Gail, <strong>The Last of Us Season 3 will mostly revolve around Abby. </strong></p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This makes sense, considering we haven&#8217;t seen Abby since the end of Episode 2. However, those unfamiliar with the story of Part 2 may not be prepared for how much the next season will focus on Joel&#8217;s killer. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In an interview with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-catherine-ohara-pedro-pascal-the-studio-1236403911/">Variety</a>, O&#8217;Hara revealed she won&#8217;t reprise her role in Season 3 due to its focus on Abby, so don&#8217;t expect many &#8211; if any &#8211; scenes in Jackson. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When asked if she&#8217;ll return in future seasons, she said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Craig did say definitely not this next season. It&#8217;s the Abby story. Maybe. But I think it was to serve Joel and Ellie.&#8221;</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the game, Abby shows up at the theater just as Ellie, Jesse, Dina, and Tommy decide to return to Jackson before anyone else gets hurt. She threatens to shoot Ellie, and suddenly, the game&#8217;s POV switches to Abby and takes players back three days earlier to &#8220;Seattle Day One&#8221; &#8211; and you play as Abby for the entire second portion of the game. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, if Season 3 is focused on Abby, that seems like the obvious direction for Season 2&#8217;s cliffhanger. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Ah good so it is gonna end at the character switch in the game,&#8221; one user predicted. &#8220;Lol this was so predictable the moment they said Season 2 was only 7 episodes,&#8221; another wrote. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Makes sense and echoes the game. I can&#8217;t wait to hear everyone bitching about it, then seeing the people who actually watch it until the end being rewarded for their patience while becoming Abby super fans,&#8221; a third commented. </p>
