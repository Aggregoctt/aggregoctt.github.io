<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If the Fireflies created a cure in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/the-last-of-us/">The Last of Us</a>, it would have killed Ellie &#8211;&#160;but would it have even worked? Fans have been divided, but Neil Druckmann has spoken out.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The first season&#8217;s finale pretty much mirrored the game, with Marlene dropping a huge bomb on Joel when he arrived in Salt Lake City: the procedure to create a cure from <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-ellie-immunity-3188695/">Ellie&#8217;s immunity</a> would be fatal.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In short, he murdered everyone and fled with Ellie to Jackson, and he swore to her that the cure wouldn&#8217;t have worked and they had to escape because they were attacked by raiders. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Here&#8217;s the thing: what if they went ahead with the cure&#8230; and it still didn&#8217;t work? The science behind it is questionable, but Druckmann has a firm stance on whether or not a cure was viable. </p>



<h2 id="h-would-ellie&#8217;s-cure-have-worked-in-the-last-of-us?-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Would Ellie&#8217;s cure have worked in The Last of Us? </h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Yes, if the Fireflies created a cure from Ellie for the Cordyceps pandemic, it would have worked. </p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you cast your mind back to the opening scene of The Last of Us TV show, you&#8217;ll remember Dr Neuman talking about the potential for a fungal outbreak. &#8220;There are no treatments for this, no preventatives, no cures, they don&#8217;t exist &#8211; it&#8217;s not even possible to make them,&#8221; he tells the crowd. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over 50 years later, a doctor with the Fireflies believes he can develop a cure, but he&#8217;s killed before his research comes to fruition. In Druckmann&#8217;s eyes, if they went through with the procedure, it would have worked. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Could the Fireflies make a cure? Our intent was that, yes, they could,&#8221; he told the Sacred Symbols podcast.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Now, is our science a little shaky that now people are questioning it? Yeah, it was a little shaky and now people are questioning that. I can&#8217;t say anything. All I can say is that our intent is that they would have made a cure. That makes it a more interesting philosophical question for what Joel does.&#8221;</p>  


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Druckmann is right. Joel had an impossible choice: let Ellie die and save the world, or save her and doom the world. If there&#8217;s a chance the cure wouldn&#8217;t work, his decision to kill everyone and take Ellie home loses its impact.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Similarly, it&#8217;s why Ellie is so furious when she finds out what he did. &#8220;I was supposed to die. That was my purpose. My life would have f**king mattered, but you took that from me,&#8221; she tells Joel in Episode 6. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Also, Druckmann may say the science wasn&#8217;t explored in depth, but they explained it well enough in the show. Marlene told Joel that Ellie has a &#8220;chemical messenger&#8230; it makes normal Cordyceps think that she&#8217;s Cordyceps, it&#8217;s why she&#8217;s immune.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;He&#8217;s going to remove it from her, multiply the cells in a lab, produce those chemical messengers, and then we can give it to everyone. He thinks it could be a cure, Joel,&#8221; she added.</p>
