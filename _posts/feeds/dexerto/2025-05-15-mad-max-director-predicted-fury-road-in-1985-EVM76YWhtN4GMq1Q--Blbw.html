<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Mad Max: Fury Road hit cinemas screens 10 years ago today, but director George Miller was considering focussing on a female hero three decades earlier.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the summer of 2015, it&#8217;d been three decades since a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/mad-max/">Mad Max</a> movie, and the last effort &#8211; 1985&#8217;s Beyond Thunderdome &#8211; was the weakest of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/how-many-mad-max-movies-are-there-2426823/">George Miller&#8217;s original trilogy</a>. But with Tom Hardy replacing Mel Gibson as the title character in a belated fourth entry, and early trailers ripping the roof off cinemas worldwide, expectations were high for the belated sequel.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Mad Max: Fury Road duly exceeded those expectations, delivering high-octane thrills that defied belief, grossing double its sizeable budget, receiving rave reviews pretty much across the board, and eventually being crowned <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-action-movies-of-all-time-2755952/">best action movie of all-time</a> by this very website.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But there was a surprise for longtime fans of the franchise, as while the story starts with Max, it quickly becomes Furiosa&#8217;s movie, as Charlize Theron&#8217;s &#8216;Imperator&#8217; endeavours to defeat her former captor Immortan Joe, and escape to the &#8216;Green Place.&#8217; Which is a switch that Miller was considering back in the Thunderdome days.</p> 



<h2 id="h-george-miller-said-&#8220;yes&#8221;-to-female-mad-max-in-1985" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">George Miller said &#8220;yes&#8221; to female Mad Max in 1985</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Around the release of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, journalist Anne Bilson spoke to George Miller on behalf of Time Out, only for the interview to be bumped when Orson Welles died. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But in 2015 she posted the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://multiglom.com/2015/05/12/george-miller-the-1985-interview/">full transcript</a>, and it&#8217;s fascinating to see what Miller said when asked about the potential for a female Mad Max movie. &#8220;I thought a lot about that,&#8221; comes Miller&#8217;s response. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s no question about it.&#8221;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He then discusses myths like Beauty and the Beast and King Kong, as well as violence, aggression, sexuality, and how women&#8217;s liberation has changed the world, before coming back to the core question.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;If you agree that heroes are the agents of revolution, there have been very few women heroes in society. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any reason why there can&#8217;t be a female version.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;In fact the Tina Turner [character] in the subtext of&#160;Mad Max 3, before the story started, probably followed a very classic hero story &#8211; the story of how she built Bartertown would be a very interesting story. And &#8211; in the way we discussed her back story, she would pretty well follow the hero story &#8211; she would have to. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;So a short answer is yes, I think there can be a female hero in the same way. How we would respond collectively as audiences, I don&#8217;t know. I suspect that we would respond very well, if the story was well told.&#8221;</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">And audiences did respond well some 30 years later, to the tune of more than $380 million at the global box office. The movie also paved the way for Imperator to feature in the title of prequel <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga-review-2726979/">Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</a> in 2024. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">And while that film failed commercially (if not critically), it hasn&#8217;t put studios off, with another franchise going the way of the woman this summer, via <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/ballerina-john-wick-spinoff-movie-release-date-prediction-cast-plot-more-1979830/">From the World of John Wick: Ballerina</a>. Meaning Hollywood is finally catching up with what George Miller was saying four decades ago.</p>
