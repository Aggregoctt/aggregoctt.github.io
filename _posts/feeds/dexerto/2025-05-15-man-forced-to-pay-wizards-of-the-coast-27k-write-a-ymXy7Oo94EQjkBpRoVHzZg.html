<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A man who helped steal roughly $300,000 worth of Trading Card Game (TCG) products at Gen Con 2023 has now been sentenced. Among other consequences, they&#8217;ve been forced to pay $27,000 to Magic The Gathering creators Wizards of the Coast, while also penning an apology letter to the community.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Gen Con is among the biggest TCG events in North America. Each and every year, thousands of card game enthusiasts take their valuable wares to trade or compete with. However, in 2023, disaster struck before doors even opened.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/thieves-steal-300000-worth-of-trading-card-games-at-americas-biggest-tcg-event-2238617/">Two men were seen stealing a reported $300,000 worth of TCG product</a> the day before Gen Con 2023 kicked off. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/thieves-who-allegedly-stole-300k-of-trading-card-games-might-have-worn-shirts-advertising-their-own-game-2250370/">The pair was soon identified</a> by the Indiana Police Department, and ever since have been awaiting their charges.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now, one of the two has been sentenced. Their punishment involves paying a hefty sum to those impacted, as well as penning a heartfelt apology letter to the Gen Con community.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The two men in their early 40s were identified as Thomas Dunbar and Andrew Giaume. Both were charged with felony theft upon being linked to the $300,000 heist on August 2, 2023.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Local authorities outlined how the pair used a pallet jack to take packets of Magic The Gathering, Pokemon, and Disney Lorcana cards.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While Giaume&#8217;s trial is set for July, 2025, Dunbar has now been handed his sentence. Having taken a plea to first dismiss the felony charge, the man has since been sentenced to a lower-level theft charge. In short, this means rather than taking two years in jail, he&#8217;s now on probation and must pay restitution.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Dunbar has been ordered to pay an undisclosed sum to the president of Pastimes Games, and a further $27,141 USD to Wizards of the Coast. Moreover, all items recovered from the heist must also be returned to Wizards of the Coast.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On top of the above, Dunbar has to serve 40 hours of community service and also write an apology letter to the Gen Con community.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Gen Con is pleased to see this offender brought to justice and applauds (convention center) security, IMPD, and the Marion County Prosecutor for their diligent work in concluding this case,&#8221; David Hoppe, President of Gen Con, said in a statement provided to<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2025/05/14/gen-con-heist-thomas-dunbar-takes-plea-sentenced-apology-letter-indianapolis-gen-con-theft-2023/83625599007/"> IndyStar</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Dunbar has agreed to stay away from the Gen Con event for two years as well.</p>
