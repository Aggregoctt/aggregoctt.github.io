<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Grilled cheese and cheeseburger lovers have a big reason to get excited, because Wendy&#8217;s is making their dreams come true.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Wendy&#8217;s burgers are already some of the most popular in the fast-food industry, and the chain is looking to make them even better.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;ve seen restaurants experiment with grilled cheese buns before, and now <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/wendys/">Wendy&#8217;s</a> is getting in on the action with the release of their new Grilled Cheese Cheeseburger.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s only one problem, though. It&#8217;s only available in one country&#8230; for now.</p> 



<h2 id="h-wendy&#8217;s-grilled-cheese-cheeseburger-is-only-in-canada" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Wendy&#8217;s Grilled Cheese Cheeseburger is only in Canada</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Starting May 19, select Wendy&#8217;s locations in Canada will start selling the Grilled Cheese Cheeseburger.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The chain <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.irwendys.com/news/news-details/2025/Calling-all-Cheese-Lovers-Wendys-Canada-Debuts-New-Grilled-Cheese-Cheeseburger-2025-5b_dTswiO4/default.aspx">describes the item</a> as a &#8220;quarter pound of fresh, never frozen Canadian beef topped with caramelized onions, creamy mayo, and a melty cheese slice made with Canadian dairy, all served between even more cheese with two grilled cheese sandwiches as buns.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This new menu item comes as the chain celebrates its 50th year in the country. According to International Culinary Innovation manager Hayley Kianoff, to celebrate, they&#8217;re giving Canadians &#8220;the first taste.&#8221;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As such, this suggests that this grilled cheese creation could be coming to other parts of the world eventually, similar to how Canada was able to try out <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/food/mcdonalds-big-arch-review-is-this-behemoth-of-a-burger-better-than-the-big-mac-2878982/">McDonald&#8217;s Big Arch</a> before the United States.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, how does it taste and how much does it cost? Well, back in February, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/">YouTuber</a> Dave Drew was able to get his hands on it during an even earlier promotional test period and called it &#8220;delicious.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At the time, it retailed for $7.59 CDN (around $5.43 USD), which is still less expensive than Wendy&#8217;s flagship Baconator.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;ll have to see how the country responds to this latest creation and if it ends up being upgraded to a permanent menu item down the line if it&#8217;s well enough received.</p>
