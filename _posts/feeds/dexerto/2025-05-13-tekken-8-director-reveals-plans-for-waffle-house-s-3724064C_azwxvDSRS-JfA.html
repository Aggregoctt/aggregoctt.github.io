<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Tekken Director Katsuhiro Harada has revealed his plan to add &#8216;Waffle House&#8217; to the game as a stage despite the chain not getting back to him.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For over a year, Tekken fans have <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tekken/harada-responds-to-tekken-8-fans-demanding-waffle-house-crossover-2620811/">requested Waffle House</a> as a stage in the iconic fighting game and Harada has been listening.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For those who aren&#8217;t familiar with Waffle House, it&#8217;s an American 24/7 breakfast chain where, for whatever reason, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/christmas-brawl-at-waffle-house-goes-viral-after-customers-attack-employees-2019294/">viral fights</a> always seem to break down involving both customers and staff &#8211; something which may actually be <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/viral-waffle-house-brawls-may-be-good-for-its-business-model-2469707/">good for its business model</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As such, the idea of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tekken/">Tekken</a> characters battling it out in Waffle House has become a bit of a meme in the community while still being a legitimate request. In fact, according to Harada, he&#8217;s reached out to Waffle House for a collab.</p>



<h2 id="h-tekken-director-explains-how-he&#8217;ll-add-unofficial-waffle-house-stage" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Tekken Director explains how he&#8217;ll add unofficial Waffle House stage</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 12, Harada responded to a fan&#8217;s inquiry about the potential of Waffle House being added to Tekken.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;If we can&#8217;t get that &#8216;House&#8217; name license, how about we call it &#8216;Hustle House&#8217; stage?&#8221; he <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1922113179674345512">asked</a>. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t that make sense to everyone?&#8221;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fans overwhelmingly agreed that the name didn&#8217;t matter as long as it was clear what the stage was referencing.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Heck, call it Tekken House, everyone will recognize it and love it,&#8221; one fan replied.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;As long as it&#8217;s a late night diner, we&#8217;d get it and love it!&#8221; another chimed in. &#8220;But we may ask you make a Hustle House <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/waffle-house-employees-tired-of-brawling-customers-were-not-mma-fighters-2376580/">employee fighter</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Harada further stated that over the past year, he had tried to make contact with Waffle House and &#8220;fully understood&#8221; why fans wanted the chain added as a stage.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Over the past year or more, I&#8217;ve actually tried to make contact through several different channels. However, and this is purely my own speculation, I suspect that the lack of response may be due to the fact that the project I&#8217;m known for revolves around &#8216;fighting-themed video games,&#8217;&#8221; he <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1922122520406458818">remarked</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;That said, if&#8212;like I suggested earlier&#8212;using a different name or format is acceptable as long as the core message is maintained, then I would be willing to seriously reconsider and explore this again.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Given the response by the community, it&#8217;s looking increasingly likely that &#8216;Waffle House&#8217; will finally come to Tekken, albeit under a different name.</p>
