<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/silver-palace-pre-registration-gameplay-characters-3194784/">Silver Palace</a> has quickly caught the attention of the gacha game community thanks to its sleek character-driven combat and Victorian-inspired world. While the devs have yet to reveal a release date, over 600k players have already pre-registered for the upcoming anime RPG.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Following the gameplay reveal, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/new-gacha-game-silver-palace-is-a-must-play-for-every-genshin-impact-fan-3195447/">we were also wowed by Silver Palace and believe it&#8217;s shaping up to be a must-play for every Genshin Impact fan</a>. Popular Twitch streamer Asmongold also believes it could give HoYoverse&#8217;s open-world game a run for its money.</p> 



<h2 id="h-asmongold-wowed-by-silver-palace-gameplay" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Asmongold wowed by Silver Palace gameplay</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This is looking extremely good, this might be one of the best-looking video games coming out,&#8221; said the Twitch streamer. &#8220;[Silver Palace] is part of that next generation of gacha games.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While Silver Palace has yet to get a release date, the devs did upload a gameplay trailer showing off the game&#8217;s Victorian-style world and sleek combat. Asmon was keen to point out how impressed he was with the visuals, noting how the lighting and effects felt like an improvement over current gacha games.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I will say that the graphics and the quality are a step up from Genshin and even Wuthering Waves,&#8221; he said while watching the trailer. The streamer was also wowed by the game&#8217;s bustling streets, which were filled with roaming NPCs, cars, trams, and enemies that the main protagonist can investigate.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It wasn&#8217;t just the environment that Asmon was impressed by, as he was left stunned by Silver Palace&#8217;s magical mount. &#8220;Oh, sh*t, drifting on the unicorn,&#8221; the streamer yelled in excitement. Minutes later, Asmon was wowed again when the same mount proceeded to fly through the skies, letting the player control it as they flew over rooftops.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The only thing Asmongold felt could be improved was the game&#8217;s interface, which he believes is a little messy in its current state.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I feel like the combat looks pretty good, but the [damage] numbers are a little bit messy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The UI is a little bit basic &#8211; a little bit of stylization for it would go really far.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Asmon mentioned adding more flair to enemy health bars, while also being able to zoom out a little bit would help with overall clarity. Despite this small complaint, he was left impressed by Silver Palace and is looking forward to its eventual release.</p>
