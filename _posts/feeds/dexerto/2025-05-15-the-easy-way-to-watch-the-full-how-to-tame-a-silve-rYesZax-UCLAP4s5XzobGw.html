<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>The best way to watch the full How to Tame a Silver Fox movie is via ReelShort</strong>, which is the app that originally produced the film. </p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">All 71 episodes can be watched exclusively on the ReelShort app, which is available via Apple&#8217;s App Store and the Google Play online shop.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, the app&#8217;s ad system has been criticized by several users, with one reviewer writing: &#8220;Although ReelShort advertises content for as little as a dime per episode, my experience has been that the actual cost is closer to $2 per episode.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Like WebToon and other services, you pay for a certain number of coins and then use coins to buy episodes. The coins make it easier to lose sight of how much you&#8217;ve spent, so it can add up quickly.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fortunately, the first 12 episodes are free on the app, and the first 10 have been uploaded to YouTube, albeit with an unmissable watermark over the clips.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There are also various Reddit threads linking to places you can watch the whole thing, though these can quickly disappear. </p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As ReelShort tells us, <strong>Harper plans to seduce her dad&#8217;s overprotective friend Chris to get him fired, but as he keeps rescuing her from trouble during her Yale senior year, she starts developing real feelings for him.</strong></p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s adapted from the Sophie Sparks novel of the same name, which gives us a much more detailed overview.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The original book synopsis reads, &#8220;If it&#8217;s not the mean girls&#8217; relentless bullying at university, it&#8217;s her obsessive and embittered ex-boyfriend, Bryan, sending her threats around the clock. Now, in the middle of the semester, Harper&#8217;s father sends his highly trained best friend, Chris, to look after her and keep a close eye on her safety.<br><br>&#8220;Chris has known her since she was a child, but while he&#8217;s sworn to keep a protective distance, focusing on her security&#8230; the chemistry between them is undeniable, and the line between protector and dominant lover begins to blur. Being a wealthy, handsome, and overly fierce protector, Chris shows Harper that her adulthood comes with new boundaries &#8211; and complications.<br><br>&#8220;Will Harper and Chris resist their growing attraction? Or will he show her just how much fun babysitting can be?&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s also worth pointing out the Southeast Asian drama of the same name &#8211; if you click on any links to this, you&#8217;re going to get a completely different story.</p>
