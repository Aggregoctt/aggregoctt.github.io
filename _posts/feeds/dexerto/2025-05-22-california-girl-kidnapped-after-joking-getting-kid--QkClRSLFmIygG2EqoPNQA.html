<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A 10-year-old girl from California was kidnapped after posting &#8220;getting kidnapped lmao&#8221; as a joke on TikTok. The man allegedly behind the crime is now behind bars awaiting trial.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On April 13, 27-year-old Matthew Naval was discovered with the girl and her pet bird at a strip mall in Elk Grove &#8212; over 250 miles from her home in Kern County.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Naval reportedly met her on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/roblox/">Roblox</a>, an online gaming platform, in March 2025. The two had been chatting on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/discord/">Discord</a> for some time before agreeing to meet up at midnight to hang out at a park together.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When discovered by law enforcement, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-05-15/girl-made-tiktok-about-getting-kidnapped-then-went-missing-with-man-she-met-on-roblox-authorities-say">the girl told authorities</a> that she had lost track of time speaking with Naval in-person, and didn&#8217;t realize that he was driving away from her hometown until hours had already passed. She said she wasn&#8217;t sure how to bring it up to him at the time.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Naval, however, claimed the girl had told him she was 18, saying he wanted to help her &#8220;escape&#8221; from her parents&#8217; alleged verbal abuse.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The man also told authorities that they wanted to be together as a couple, as laid out in a report filed in the Kern County Superior Court. However, he allegedly admitted she looked younger in-person, telling a deputy, &#8220;I think it would be best if I don&#8217;t know how old she is.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Naval&#8217;s attorney claims he suffers from mental health issues and that he might have autism, although no official diagnosis has been brought forward.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The kidnapping took place a day after the girl had posted a video on TikTok showing herself being driven in a car, looking out the window. The clip was captioned, &#8220;First time getting kidnapped, lmao.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a statement to deputies, she said that she &#8220;would like to know that he doesn&#8217;t do it to anyone else,&#8221; in response to a question about what she&#8217;d like to happen to Naval.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">His lawyer, however, argues that Roblox should share some of the blame for the kidnapping.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I think Roblox has to take some responsibility here. I think the parents have to take some responsibility,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The penalty for this travesty, which is a really, really huge misunderstanding, should not fall on Matthew&#8217;s shoulders alone.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a statement to a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.kget.com/video/full-jailhouse-interview-with-matthew-naval-accused-in-kidnapping-of-10-year-old-kern-county-girl/10653115/">local news outlet</a>, Naval admitted that he &#8220;should have been more careful.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I should&#8217;ve been more questioning when it came to having that person involved,&#8221; he said.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Kern County records show that Naval is currently being held in a Bakersfield prison on a $1.35 million bond.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He has been charged with a number of felonies, to all which he has pleaded not guilty. These include &#8220;one count of kidnapping, a count of kidnapping a child under 14 to commit lewd or lascivious acts, two counts of lewd or lascivious acts with a child under 14, a count of exhibiting harmful material to a minor, a count of contacting a minor with intent to commit a sexual offense and a count of contacting a minor to commit a sexual offense.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Naval&#8217;s court date has been set for June 25, 2025.</p>
