<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A court has ordered a 24-year-old mother to pay her daughter a little over $2,000 after cracking an egg over her head in a viral TikTok prank.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Beware, parents: pranking your kids for <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tiktok/">TikTok</a> content can not only get you convicted of harassment, but also have you pay a fine to your own child.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Back in 2023, a mom from Helsingborg, Sweden cracked an egg over her daughter&#8217;s head as part of a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/viral/">viral</a> TikTok prank trend.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As part of the fad, parents who bake with their kids pretend to crack an egg with a bowl but instead crack it over their child&#8217;s head, sometimes getting yolk on their faces.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Well, one viewer ended up reporting the video to police &#8211; and Swedish authorities didn&#8217;t share the mom&#8217;s enthusiasm when it came to viral content.</p>



<h2 id="h-mom-convicted-of-harassment-for-tiktok-egg-prank" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Mom convicted of harassment for TikTok egg prank</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://pubity.com/mother-guilty-of-cracking-egg-on-child/">Pubity</a>, the police launched an investigation, and in 2025, the mom was convicted of harassment.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Prosecutor Cecilia Andersson argued that the mom had &#8220;degraded&#8221; her daughter for views and that she was acting &#8216;recklessly.&#8217;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;When I saw the video, I thought: you simply don&#8217;t do that to a child. To record and humiliate the child and then broadcast it to thousands of viewers &#8211; I find that incredibly degrading, and that&#8217;s my personal opinion,&#8221; she told reporters.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It&#8217;s a little girl who thinks she&#8217;s going to bake an apple cake with her mom and is happy and excited about it, and then all of a sudden, she gets an egg cracked in her forehead. This is a reckless act.&#8221;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The mom, meanwhile, defended herself in court and claimed she was just partaking in a viral trend. &#8220;Everyone was doing it,&#8221; she <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://townflex.com/mom-fined-for-cracking-egg-on-daughters-head-in-viral-tiktok-prank/">said</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Her defense failed, however, and in addition to being found guilty of harassment by the Helsingborg District Court, the mom was also ordered to fork over SEK 20,000, around $2,055 USD to her daughter.</p>
