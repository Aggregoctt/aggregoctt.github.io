According to Montana Jordan, they&#8217;re &#8220;ready&#8221; for him.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Cast your mind back to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/young-sheldon-ending-explained-season-7-finale-breakdown-2727425/">Young Sheldon Season 7</a>. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/young-sheldon-george-cooper-sr-obituary-2714637/">George has died</a>, we&#8217;ve had the most traumatic collective experience ever by attending <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/young-sheldon-season-7-episode-13-recap-2727382/">his funeral</a>, and then Sheldon officially left for Caltech.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the new spinoff, Sheldon is the only member of the Cooper family unaccounted for on screen &#8211; even <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/georgie-and-mandys-first-marriage-george-return-mistake-3052146/">George has been able to return</a>. But will it actually happen?</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We know where his story ended up thanks to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/the-big-bang-theory/">The Big Bang Theory</a>, but there&#8217;s a huge gap to bridge between it and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/young-sheldon/">Young Sheldon</a>. Whatever happens, the cast is &#8220;ready&#8221; for the moment we&#8217;re all waiting for. </p>



<h2 id="h-sheldon-still-doesn&#8217;t-have-confirmed-georgie-&amp;-mandy-spinoff-cameo" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Sheldon still doesn&#8217;t have confirmed Georgie &amp; Mandy spinoff cameo</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As the first season of Georgie &amp; Mandy&#8217;s First Marriage comes to a close, we&#8217;re none the wiser when &#8211; or even, if &#8211; Sheldon will ever make an appearance. But if he does, star Montana Jordan will be &#8220;ready&#8221; to welcome him home with open arms. </p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking to Dexerto, Jordan explained, &#8220;We&#8217;ll always welcome him with open arms. I think the storyline is he&#8217;s off at college right now, and Georgie is doing his thing. I don&#8217;t know if they had a fallout, but it&#8217;s something along those lines. I remember when Jerry O&#8217;Connell was playing Georgie in Big Bang Theory, Sheldon was inviting Georgie to his wedding. Some scenes have passed back and forth about how they hadn&#8217;t seen each other in however many years. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;But like I said, we&#8217;ll always welcome him with open arms. Whenever he wants to come on, tell him to come on.&#8221; </p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When we first met Georgie in Season 11&#8217;s &#8216;The Sibling Realignment&#8217; in TBBT, he was a completely different man. Obviously he was much older than the version we know in the Georgie &amp; Mandy spinoff, but a lot of romantic drama had also unfolded.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/will-sheldon-be-in-the-georgie-mandy-spinoff-2691293/">Sheldon</a> reunites with his now-single brother, who has a string of ex-wives and girlfriends behind him. When Sheldon eventually wins the Nobel Prize, he mentions two of Georgie&#8217;s ex-wives getting in touch to congratulate him.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In short, there&#8217;s a huge distance still between both shows, and we don&#8217;t yet know how close we&#8217;ll get to the main show. In the meantime, there are still plenty of scenes left with the rest of the Coopers &#8211; Mary, Missy, and Meemaw &#8211; and for Jordan, they feel no different from Young Sheldon. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Everybody is so close and so loving. No matter where we&#8217;re at, it always feels like a family,&#8221; Jordan continued. &#8220;It&#8217;s always great when they come visit us on our set. They had to create a Cooper house on Georgie and Mandy set, and it&#8217;s incredible how they can make it look exactly the same. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It&#8217;s like we never left Young Sheldon, it&#8217;s pretty incredible. Anytime that we get to have them back on the show, we love it.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Georgie &amp; Mandy&#8217;s First Marriage Season 2 is expected to premiere this fall.
