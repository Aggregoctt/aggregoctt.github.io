<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Turns out Night City isn&#8217;t big enough for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel. CD Projekt Red&#8217;s sequel is going Midwest.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, codenamed <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/cyberpunk-2077/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-development-updates-everything-we-know-so-far-1950429/">Project Orion</a>, is officially in the works. CD Projekt Red, fresh off wrapping Phantom Liberty in 2023, is deep into pre-production.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The studio&#8217;s Boston office is leading development, and job listings confirm it&#8217;ll keep its first-person roots. They&#8217;re aiming for a smarter crowd system, deeper narrative, and new locations. Don&#8217;t hold your breath though; this one&#8217;s not dropping before 2028. Maybe even the 2030s. And yes, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/the-witcher-4/">The Witcher 4</a> is eating most of their time right now.</p> 



<h2 id="h-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-trades-night-city-glam-for-chicago-grime" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel trades Night City glam for Chicago grime</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now for the juicy part: creator Mike Pondsmith spilled some tea. In a new <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/cyberpunk-2077-tworca-potwierdza-nowe-miasto-w-kontynuacji-to-chicago-ktore-poszlo-w-zla-strone">interview with Polish gaming magazine CD-Action</a>, he teased that Orion will feature &#8220;another city,&#8221; one that reminded him of &#8220;Chicago gone wrong.&#8221; He made it clear that Night City isn&#8217;t going anywhere either.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So buckle up, and maybe start listening to Joe Keery&#8217;s End of Beginning again, because the next Cyberpunk playground could be broader, meaner, and windier.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Mike Pondsmith is the guy who made the Cyberpunk 2020 tabletop RPG, the blueprint for Cyberpunk 2077. He didn&#8217;t just sign off on the game; he consulted closely on its world and tone. He&#8217;s the reason Night City feels like a gritty fever dream of future California. So when he drops clues, you should probably listen.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;There&#8217;s another city we visit,&#8221; he said during the interview. &#8220;Night City is still there&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t feel like Blade Runner, it&#8217;s more like Chicago gone wrong.&#8221; His comments align with long-standing fan theories about Orion being set in 2080s Chicago. He even ended the chat with a wink: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know when to shut up.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With CDPR&#8217;s Boston studio steering the ship and plenty of hard lessons from 2077, Project Orion could be massive. Just don&#8217;t expect to jack in anytime soon.</p>
