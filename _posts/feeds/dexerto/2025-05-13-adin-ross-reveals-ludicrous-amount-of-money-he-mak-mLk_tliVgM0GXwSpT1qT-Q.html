<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Streaming star Adin Ross showed off his eye-popping earnings from broadcasting on Kick throughout April &#8212; but it was only half of what he could have made that month.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/adin-ross/">Adin Ross</a> is one of the most popular streamers on the net, best known for his <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/adin-ross-hit-with-ban-on-twitch-following-move-to-kick-2071549/">fiery split from Twitch</a> in 2023 and his subsequent backing of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/kick/">Kick</a> as a competitor platform.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Since then, he&#8217;s been <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/adin-ross-suddenly-unbanned-from-twitch-over-2-years-after-indefinite-ban-3172441/">unbanned from Twitch</a> but has continued to stream full-time on Kick, where he&#8217;s been making quite the bag for himself.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ross flexed on his friends and viewers during a May 12 broadcast, deciding to share how much money he made throughout the month of April.</p>



<h2 id="h-adin-ross-is-making-$500k-per-month-from-streaming-alone" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Adin Ross is making $500K per month from streaming alone</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As shown by his Kick metrics, Ross earned a whopping $493,727.67 &#8212; nearly $500K. However, he quickly explained that he could have made twice that amount if he had actually streamed every day that month.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In April, Ross only streamed 16 times, meaning that he could have potentially doubled his income. That&#8217;s not all; his $493K monthly revenue didn&#8217;t include subscriptions from viewers or money from his sponsorships.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After being prodded to share the full amount by fellow streamer and music artist DDG, Ross declined to answer, jokingly asking him if he was a federal agent coming to audit his bank account.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This isn&#8217;t the first time Ross has been open about his earnings with fans. Earlier in April, Ross showed that he&#8217;d made $150K over the course of seven streams.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Multiplying that by four, Ross said that he could make over <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/kick/adin-ross-shows-off-huge-kick-earnings-without-even-needing-subscribers-3178421/">half a million dollars per month</a> &#8212; not including subscriptions or other sponsorships.</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">His total April income, revealed in May, tracks with this statement, and it&#8217;s just part of his plan to bring other streamers &#8212; and even viewers &#8212; over to Kick.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In late April, Ross revealed that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/kick-wants-to-steal-twitchs-best-viewers-with-big-money-offer-3186983/">Kick will be paying clippers</a> to create clips from streamers&#8217; broadcasts for things like YouTube videos, compilations and highlight reels, meaning that streamers won&#8217;t have to pay anything themselves.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;&#8220;If you get clip sh*t for streamers on Kick, you&#8217;re going to get paid double pretty much. My clippers this month made, what, 100k? If you&#8217;re a streamer on Kick and you pay clippers, it&#8217;s going to get paid for,&#8221; Ross said.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ross is just the latest big streamer to be transparent about his income. Other top influencers have also not been shy about sharing their revenue, such as Myth, who revealed <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/myth-reveals-how-much-youtube-paid-him-for-two-year-contract-3001094/">YouTube had paid him $4M</a> for an exclusive streaming contract.</p>
