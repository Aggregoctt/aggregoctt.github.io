<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In typical The Boys style, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-boys-season-4-ending-explained-2827339/">Season 4 was diabolical</a> &#8211;&#160;and it didn&#8217;t hesitate to chop some of its most important characters. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ryan accidentally murdered Grace when she wouldn&#8217;t let him leave, Hughie was forced to put his dad to sleep after a dose of Temp V went haywire, and Butcher ripped <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-boys-victoria-neumans-powers-and-origins-explained-2745148/">Victoria Neuman</a> in half. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-superhero-tv-shows-2581102/">superhero show</a> will conclude with its highly anticipated fifth season, set to pick up after Homelander ordered a nationwide manhunt of &#8220;Starlighters&#8221; and Hughie and co&#8217;s arrest, with Butcher on the run&#8230; with the last dose of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/gen-v-what-is-the-virus-2332080/">the virus</a>.

<h2 id="h-homelander-and-butcher-are-doomed-in-the-boys-season-5" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Homelander and Butcher are doomed in The Boys Season 5</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Homelander is the likeliest casualty in The Boys Season 5. He&#8217;s been the show&#8217;s big bad from the beginning, and he&#8217;s way past the point of redemption. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Yes, he is a tragic figure. Unlike other Vought &#8216;heroes&#8217; who were recruited as teens and even adults, his conception was ordered by the corporation, and he was effectively raised (and tortured) by its scientists.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Alas, excluding that brief team-up with Butcher in Season 3 to stop Soldier Boy from killing Ryan (and any time he&#8217;s saved people, many of which could have been orchestrated by Vought), there&#8217;s been no indication that he&#8217;s interested in redeeming himself. </p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;He is in an all-timer list of great antagonists, and he just makes it so real and complicated and weirdly vulnerable at times, and just human,&#8221; Kripke told <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.goldderby.com/feature/the-boys-eric-kripke-antony-starr-homelander-video-interview-1206013803/">Gold Derby</a>. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;You have to understand where he&#8217;s coming from, and why he&#8217;s doing what he&#8217;s doing. He&#8217;s the hero of his own story. It&#8217;s just a really twisted story.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a new interview with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/the-boys-team-season-5-hints-interview-1236385660/">Deadline</a>, Kripke said there will &#8220;probably be lots of deaths&#8221; and &#8220;there&#8217;s no guarantee of who&#8217;s gonna survive.&#8221; Nathan Mitchell, who plays Black Noir, also promised, &#8220;There are some things that are coming in Season 5 that you&#8217;re not going to have in your bingo card.&#8221;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Butcher could also die by the end of Season 5, if the show follows the comics. In the source material, Homelander dies&#8230; but Butcher becomes the story&#8217;s endgame villain, something the series has already set up with his newfound powers and his brutal execution of Neuman. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I doubt it&#8217;ll end exactly the same, but they&#8217;ve introduced all the key pieces (Butcher&#8217;s growing extremism, supe genocide as an ideology, a virus that could kill all supes) to set up Butcher as the final antagonist,&#8221; one Redditor predicted. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I doubt they go down that road but my guess for how it ends is Butcher is gonna do something with the virus and Homelander and his followers are probably gonna do something big and this will be scorched earth. One thing is for certain though Butcher is definitely dying in the finale,&#8221; another wrote. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Kripke has already described Butcher and Homelander as &#8220;two sides of the same coin&#8230; they&#8217;re the epic hero and villain of the show.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;By design,&#160;we always love it when we can put Butcher and Homelander around the same emotional journeys&#160;and see how they react to them,&#8221; he told <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.tvinsider.com/1190791/the-boys-season-5-homelander-butcher-soldier-boy-eric-kripke/">TV Insider</a>. </p>
