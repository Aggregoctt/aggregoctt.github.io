<div>
<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The SMG meta is very competitive in Warzone, but there&#8217;s a surprising pick from MW3 that can go toe-to-toe with the very best after a recent buff. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/warzone-season-3-reloaded-update-3181538/">Season 3 Reloaded update</a> shook things up in Warzone, adding the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/best-ladra-loadout-in-warzone-3189039/">new Ladra SMG</a>, which has quickly become the go-to close-range option. It also came with a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/all-buffs-and-nerfs-in-warzone-black-ops-6-season-3-reloaded-3187439/">host of weapon balancing</a> changes, giving some forgotten guns a new lease of life.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Most notably, it <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/mw2-mw3-guns-are-finally-good-in-warzone-again-3188547/">buffed some of the best guns from MW2 and MW3</a> to bring their TTKs more in line with the Black Ops 6 weapons. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While most of these haven&#8217;t quite managed to trouble the meta, the PDSW 528, better known as the classic P90, is an SMG you shouldn&#8217;t sleep on. </p>



<h2 id="h-p90-outguns-meta-smgs-with-insane-warzone-ttk-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">P90 outguns meta SMGs with insane Warzone TTK </h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">CoD expert WhosImmortal highlighted the P90 in a YouTube video, where he compared its time-to-kill to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/best-warzone-smg-loadouts-attachments-and-setups-ranked-1993712/">Warzone&#8217;s best SMGs</a>. In its first damage range, up to around 12 meters, its TTK of 594ms is virtually identical to the C9 and Ladra, which came in at 574ms and 560ms, respectively. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Meanwhile, it was actually quicker than both the KSV and Saug, two of the most-used weapons in the category, which could only manage 660 and 600. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Things only got better in the second damage range, too. Up to just over 20 meters, the PDSW has a TTK of 660ms, which was only marginally bettered by the C9 at 656ms. </p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This rapid TTK is largely down to the P90&#8217;s impressive rate, so as long as you&#8217;re hitting your shots consistently at short range, you should have no problem melting through enemies. If you want to get the most out of it, he shared the ideal loadout:</p>  



<ul class="pl-10 mt-1 overflow-y-hidden font-body text-body-1 text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white dark:text-body-1 dark:font-body mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text List_list___uTwY wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: 16&#8243; Cloak 90</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: DR-6 Handstop</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: STIP-40 Grip</li>



<li><strong>Comb</strong>: TV TacComb</li>



<li><strong>Laser</strong>: Kimura Ryl33 Laser Light</li>
</ul>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With the setup, the SMG is extremely easy to use with next to no recoil, while still feeling snappy thanks to quick ADS speeds. Most importantly, as WhosImmortal explained, it&#8217;s a &#8220;ton of fun&#8221; and surprisingly competitive. </p>
