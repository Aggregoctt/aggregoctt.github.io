<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Nintendo has addressed rumors claiming Mario Kart World is using AI-like assets in the Switch 2 game.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-and-players-are-all-saying-the-same-thing-3032733/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> set to launch on June 5, 2025, excitement around the new console is at an all-time high. One of the games that has been confirmed to be <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/nintendo-switch-2-launch-titles-3031061/">immediately available at launch</a> is Mario Kart World.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fans first got a glimpse of this game during the Nintendo Direct presentation, which showcased different maps and characters, as well as our first look at the open world pivot.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, shortly after this reveal, rumors started circulating that some assets seen in the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq4uCJDwO9U&amp;t=883s">game&#8217;s Treehouse live stream</a> may have been created with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Nintendo has now responded to the accusations in a new statement.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-denies-the-use-of-ai-in-mario-kart-world" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Nintendo denies the use of AI in Mario Kart World</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-suggestion-that-ai-generated-images-used-in-mario-kart-world">Eurogamer</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson has pushed back against this claim, saying outright that &#8220;AI-generated images were not used in the development of Mario Kart World.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One of the allegations in question referred to the text at the bottom of the billboard in the stream. As one user <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1k42r5h/some_assets_in_mario_kart_world_appear_to_be/">pointed out,</a> the text looked like it was an &#8220;upscaled&#8221; AI from a smaller image, and that it had a &#8220;strange effect.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Other billboards were also said to have wonky lines and &#8220;weird images,&#8221; pointing to the possible use of Generative AI. One of them included a car with somewhat large and unnatural-looking windows, though Nintendo has clearly sought to shut down any notion of AI use in its creation.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Nintendo has made it clear they&#8217;re not one to embrace AI. Mario creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, has previously spoken about this topic during an interview with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/design/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-nintendo-museum.html">The New York Times</a> in September 2024.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Miyamoto said that the company would rather go in a different direction in terms of AI use. &#8220;There is a lot of talk about A.I. When that happens, everyone starts to go in the same direction, but that is where Nintendo would rather go in a different direction.&#8221;</p>
