<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Expedition 33 was released back in April 2025 and has taken over the internet after debuting as one of the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/clair-obscur-expedition-33-debuts-as-one-of-the-highest-rated-games-ever-3185978/">highest-rated video games ever</a>. </p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On Wednesday, May 14, the developers hit out at websites using AI-generated pictures to sell pushies of one of its <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/clair-obscur-expedition-33-cast-characters-2951676/">popular NPCs, Esquie</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We&#8217;ve noticed a number of suspicious websites popping up, claiming to sell Esquie plushies,&#8221; they said in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1922603248415908078">a post on X.</a> &#8220;This makes us whooo. To be clear: any third-party websites selling Esquie plushies are NOT officially licensed. Many of them are using AI-generated artwork to advertise, and we strongly recommend against purchasing from these sources. They could be scams.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">To balance out the scams, the developers are looking into ways to make official plushies for fans to enjoy. </p>

In the meantime, please be patient &#8212; and don&#8217;t get scammed!&#8221; they added.</p>
