<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/why-did-fred-west-need-appropriate-adult-janet-leach-netflix-documentary-3195446/">Fred and Rose West</a> documentary and crime thriller Dept.

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">All episodes of new Netflix series Snakes and Ladders are available to watch now, and there&#8217;s a good reason why you should binge it this weekend. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-snakes-and-ladders-about?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">What is Snakes and Ladders about?</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Snakes and Ladders follows <strong>Dora L&#243;pez, a teacher at an prestigious school who wants to become principal. When an altercation breaks out between two eight-year-old students, a feud starts between two most influential families in the state.</strong></p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, where does the title come in? As Netflix explains, Dora must &#8220;climb a slippery ladder of lies and corruption to reach the top.&#8221; What begins as a simple school incident ends up altering the course of her life, with her ambition put at risk.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Soon, she finds herself forced to face a situation beyond her control, having to make incredibly difficult decisions over the next few days &#8211; even if it means questioning the values that have defined her life as a teacher.</p>  



<h2 id="h-how-many-episodes-are-there?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">How many episodes are there?</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There are <strong>eight episodes </strong>in Snakes and Ladders, with each ranging between 40-45 minutes. </p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This is fairly standard for a Netflix release, meaning you can easily binge the entire series across one weekend. As it&#8217;s an original story, there&#8217;s nothing it&#8217;s been adapted from, so we can&#8217;t tell if there would ever be more episodes further down the line.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At this stage, Netflix has not commented on a potential second season. </p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While the series doesn&#8217;t have an official Rotten Tomatoes score, <strong>early reviews describe the workplace comedy as an explicit telenovela version of shows like Abbott Elementary. </strong></p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Decider <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://decider.com/2025/05/14/snakes-and-ladders-netflix-review-stream-it-or-skip-it/">weighed in</a>, &#8220;If we were to be completely honest about Snakes And Ladders, which was created by Manolo Caro, there are certainly elements of telenovela mixed into the stories about school politics and overprotective parents. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;While it seems that being headmistress is too small a goal for Dora to be compromising herself over, without that willingness to soften her previously-rigid stance on ethics and rules, there would be no show.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;At the end of the day, Snakes and Ladders is like a comedy of errors that feels almost as if Matilda was made for adults before the headmistress became the headmistress. To be fair, there&#8217;s actually a plot here, and it does eventually go into the thriller side of things, but I still think it could&#8217;ve been shorter with a crisper wrap-up, which would&#8217;ve made the ending seem more impactful,&#8221; DMTalkies <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://dmtalkies.com/snakes-and-ladders-netflix-tv-show-review-2025/">added</a>. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Times of India also <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/web-series/reviews/tamil/snakes-ladders/season-1/seasonreview/114338432.cms">called it</a> &#8220;An engaging crime game where excitement overshadows logic.&#8221;</p>
