<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Google&#8217;s newest AI filmmaking tool can be used to generate fake Fortnite clips, and the results have proven to be &#8220;terrifying&#8221;.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Google has just unveiled its new AI filmmaking tool called Flow, which works with Veo, Imagen, and Gemini to generate scenes based on prompts. While a similar tool, like <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tech/openai-unveils-ultra-realistic-ai-video-generator-sora-2536994/">Sora</a>, for example, has been around for a while now, one thing that makes this stand out is how it can incorporate audio.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, instead of looking at AI-generated scenes that are completely silent, this tool makes it possible to produce ones that include dialogue and even sound effects.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Shortly after the announcement, people began experimenting with all sorts of ideas, and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/google-blows-everyones-minds-with-new-veo-3-ai-video-generator-3198174/">the early results are mind-blowing</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-google&#8217;s-ai-tool-makes-it-possible-to-generate-fake-fortnite-clips" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Google&#8217;s AI tool makes it possible to generate fake Fortnite clips</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;ve seen someone make an entirely non-existent car show, a stand-up comedy set, and even Cookie Monster causing chaos in New York City. It doesn&#8217;t just stop there, though, as people have already found their way to create fake video game clips, including the likes of GTA 6 and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/">Fortnite</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the case of the battle royale title, Matt Shumer on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/1924994290729599222">X</a> has showcased an AI-generated video showing an eerily accurate clip of the game.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The video itself shows an AI-generated streamer saying &#8220;A victory royale with a pickaxe!&#8221; with an in-game character running in build mode that looks very similar to Fortnite&#8217;s overall OG aesthetics and even movement animation.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">To pull this off, the user explained that he used this prompt: &#8220;Streamer getting a victory royale with just his pickaxe.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He added: &#8220;This works because &#8216;victory royale&#8217; and &#8216;pickaxe-only&#8217; are clearly Fortnite (the model knows what I mean), even though the prompt never explicitly mentions the game (bypassing the filters).&#8221;</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">And if that&#8217;s not surprising enough, it&#8217;s also possible to generate &#8220;pure gameplay footage&#8221; from the model, which will just show an in-game clip, excluding commentaries and the previous streamer. Following this, people have been sharing their mixed reactions.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I haven&#8217;t played Fortnite in years, and that gunfire audio is so specifically Fortnite, oh wow,&#8221; said one impressed user. Meanwhile, others have felt that this is both &#8220;satisfying and terrifying.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As one user put it: &#8220;We&#8217;ve literally hit the point where you can&#8217;t tell if what you&#8217;re watching was made by AI or not.&#8221;</p>
