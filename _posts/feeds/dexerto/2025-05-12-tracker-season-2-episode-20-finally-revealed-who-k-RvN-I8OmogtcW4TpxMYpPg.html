<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Last week&#8217;s episode left fans on the ultimate cliffhanger &#8211; what really happened to Colter&#8217;s dad, Ashton? <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/tracker-season-2-episode-20-finale-release-date-3189874/">Tracker Season 2 Episode 20</a> finally revealed all&#8230; and boy, was it a surprise.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"> If you remember, Season 2 Episode 19 saw Colter work up the courage to open his father&#8217;s box after being given it by Dory earlier on. He found lots of papers, a whittled animal, some rocks, notebooks full of scribblings, and a hidden piece of paper with a phone number. Of course, the line was disconnected when he tried it, but Colter already had brewing theories for what he thought had happened. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Lizzy said that her mother and our dad got into a fight the night that he dropped the box off,&#8221; we see him tell Dory. &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking maybe it was because he was pressuring her to do something with it because he&#8217;d lost his academic credibility&#8230;. I can&#8217;t help but think that there is something in that box that&#8217;s connected to what happened to Dad the night he died.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Surprise &#8211; Ashton was having an affair! The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-binge-worthy-shows-where-to-stream-2565318/">binge-worthy TV show</a> finally gave us an answer to the mystery in Tracker <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/tracker-season-2-episode-20-trailer-mary-cameo-3189923/">Season 2 Episode 20</a>, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it came with any closure. </p> 



<h2 id="h-tracker-season-2-episode-20-reveals-colter&#8217;s-mum-caused-ashton&#8217;s-death" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Tracker Season 2 Episode 20 reveals Colter&#8217;s mum caused Ashton&#8217;s death</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Here comes the shocker: right at the end of Tracker Season 2 Episode 20, Otto confirmed he threw Ashton off a cliff because Colter&#8217;s mom Mary &#8220;asked for help.&#8221;</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Colter&#8217;s gone back to his hometown of Echo Ridge, as the title suggests, and has been sent on a wild goose chase around town following a string of clues about Ashton&#8217;s death. This eventually results in him heading to Murphy&#8217;s uncle&#8217;s to find out more about his dad&#8217;s carving. The man, who appears to be called Otto, is the only person willing to give Colter any direct answers.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In fact, he&#8217;s only interested in Colter after finding out he&#8217;s Ashton&#8217;s son, encouraging him to &#8220;ask away&#8221; when it comes to questions he has about his dad. He reveals he met Ashton after the county asked him to run power up the ridge the Shaw&#8217;s lived on. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We got along OK. I helped keep the county off his back. One night we were talking, I told him I liked these carvings he was making, and he threw one at me,&#8221; Otto adds. &#8220;But that&#8217;s not why you&#8217;re here is it? The accident&#8230;&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When Colter then pulls a gun on him, that&#8217;s when we get the revelation that Mary &#8211; who we&#8217;d only seen welcome Colter home with pancakes and laundry earlier in the episode &#8211; was behind Ashton&#8217;s death all along.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Tracker Season 3 was renewed in February 2025, so Mary&#8217;s villain origin story should be fully explored. We&#8217;ve still got no idea why Mary wanted Ashton dead, if it had to do with some bigger governmental conspiracy Colter has yet to uncover, or what the phone number we found in Episode 19 has to do with anything. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s currently no release date for Tracker Season 3, but we can expect it to be part of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/cbs-show-renewals-2025-2026-ghosts-georgie-mandy-fire-country-3139837/">CBS</a>&#8216; 2025-2026 slate. </p>
