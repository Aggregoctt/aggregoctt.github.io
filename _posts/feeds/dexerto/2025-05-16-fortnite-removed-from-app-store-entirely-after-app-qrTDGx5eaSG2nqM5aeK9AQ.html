<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Back in August 2020, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/fortnite-ios-app-store-mobile-2499147/">Fortnite removed itself from the iOS App Store</a> after taking a stand against the company&#8217;s commission on in-game purchases. After five years and a pretty intense court battle, which ruled in Fortnite&#8217;s favor, Epic Games has tried to get it back onto the App Store.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 9, Fortnite was sent to Apple for review. However, nearly a week later and after 120 hours, they were <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/fortnites-app-store-return-delayed-as-apple-keeps-them-waiting-3195822/">forced to pull the game and resubmit</a> so they could roll out May 16&#8217;s Fortnite&#160;<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/fortnite-35-10-patch-notes-3194066/">v35.10 update</a>. In that attempt, on May 16, Fortnite revealed that the resubmission had been blocked, taking less than a day to process.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/fortnite/status/1923293522234356169?s=46&amp;t=hYVVLCEPfyKC2MxQXhvsxQ">In a post on X,</a> the Fortnite account revealed that &#8220;Apple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the US App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union. Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As such, it looks like Fortnite won&#8217;t be available on the App Store or Epic Games Store on Apple mobiles in the US and the European Union for the foreseeable future.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s been no word from Apple regarding this decision and what prompted it, but it&#8217;s certainly left players devastated, especially those looking to dive into the adventure in its <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/full-star-wars-update-schedule-in-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-3186591/">latest Star Wars update</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;That is such a HUGE L. Honestly feel so bad for you all. Standing up for what is right and being treated like this. L Apple,&#8221; shared one comment, with many others echoing the same sentiment.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Whether it&#8217;s due to the previous lawsuit or otherwise, one thing is for certain &#8212; players can&#8217;t expect to see Fortnite gracing their Apple mobiles any time soon.</p>
