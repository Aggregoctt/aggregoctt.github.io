<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over a year after its release, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/helldivers/">Helldivers 2</a> is seeing a huge resurgence in players as one of the primary enemies finally makes its way to Super Earth.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Helldivers 2 was released back in February 2024 to a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/helldivers-2-review-brutal-bug-brilliance-2530683/">huge amount of hype and support</a>. In the same month, it reached a peak of almost half a million concurrent players on Steam, and that&#8217;s without adding in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/helldivers/what-happened-to-helldivers-2-controversy-playstation-plus-scandal-explained-2900065/">PlayStation players</a>. However, just a year on, in February 2025, it <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/helldivers/helldivers-2-could-be-in-trouble-after-player-count-plummets-2735732/">had dropped to a peak player count</a> of 96,000 players on Steam. In April, that was reduced even further to just 48,000.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Of course, a player count drop is expected, but a game rarely gets to see as big of a resurgence from a simple update or event as Helldivers 2. In fact, that 48,000 peak player count has been overshadowed by May&#8217;s peak of just under 163,000 concurrent players, all because of an epic battle.</p>



<h2 id="h-super-earth-sees-helldivers-2-player-count-skyrocket" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Super Earth sees Helldivers 2 player count skyrocket</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a recent update, which took place on May 20, the Illuminate stormed Super Earth, bringing the battle to the game&#8217;s equivalent of (you guessed it) Earth.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">During this, players are able to explore the planet they all came from, wiping out alien enemies in epic city fights, all while witnessing civilians fleeing in terror.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It seems that all the heightened chaos has fully resonated with the playerbase. Thousands who originally left the game behind have returned, with the player count practically tripling in just a few days.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Players have been tasked with saving Super Earth from the clutches of the Illuminate, fighting the alien threat to stop their home from being destroyed. Given <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HellDiversLeaks/comments/1krrm0x/super_earth_falls_news_reel_no_audio/">a few leaks on social media</a>, either route is a possibility, which is likely what&#8217;s driven so many Helldivers to jump back into the fray.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Super Earth was always a location fans hoped they could explore, and this is the first time it&#8217;s been made available. As such, when you combine the chaos of fighting on a new planet, the knowledge that it&#8217;s your own home, the familiar urban setting, and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/helldivers/helldivers-2-illuminate-faction-2582504/">the power of the Illuminate</a>, you have all the chaos and enjoyment many experienced at the height of Helldivers 2.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s easy to see why the player count has skyrocketed, but time will tell whether it holds.</p>
