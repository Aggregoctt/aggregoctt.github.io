Warning: some may find this content distressing.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In spring 2022, you&#8217;d be hard pressed to find a social media post that wasn&#8217;t connected to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/depp-v-heard-who-won-the-trial-2254064/">Depp and Heard&#8217;s defamation trial</a>. Cameras were allowed in the court room, and every sentence of testimony, piece of evidence, and body language cue was dissected by viewers at home.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It wasn&#8217;t the first high-profile trial to be broadcast &#8211; the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/netflix-american-manhunt-oj-simpson-watch-made-in-america-documentary-3050978/">O.J. Simpson</a> case in the &#8216;90s paved the way, followed by many others that gave the public a front-row seat to the courtroom. In the years since, camera access has been a contentious topic, with judges weighing up transparency against media frenzy.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But in the case of Diddy, the lack of footage isn&#8217;t due to the trial taking place in New York, nor is it about concerns over how testimony might spread on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tiktok/">TikTok</a> or Instagram. Instead, it&#8217;s due to the nature of the allegations.&#160;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s no way to watch Combs&#8217; trial, on live TV or not, because <strong>he&#8217;s facing federal charges, and cameras are strictly prohibited in the federal courtroom.&#160;</strong></p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As per the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 53, the court &#8220;must not permit the taking of photographs in the courtroom during judicial proceedings or the broadcasting of judicial proceedings from the courtroom.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There are other ways to find out what&#8217;s been happening, however. Alongside traditional news reports, networks such as <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/@LawAndCrime">Law&amp;Crime</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/@CourtTV/videos">Court TV</a> are sharing regular video content containing updates on the trial.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">You can also keep tabs on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/true-crime/">true crime</a> YouTube channels. For instance, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_wQ-qHsYjY">Rotten Mango</a> has been attending certain court sessions and will be sharing the details in upcoming videos.&#160;</p>

Taking place at Manhattan Federal Court, the first day of testimony began on May 12, 2025.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Among the details being discussed are the events known as <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/diddy-new-allegations-tmz-documentary-downfall-inside-freak-offs-tubi-2978501/">&#8220;freak offs&#8221;</a> &#8211;&#160;elaborate parties where Combs allegedly coerced women into drug-fueled sexual acts and recorded many of them without consent.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The hip-hop mogul is accused of using his power and resources to manipulate and intimidate victims. Although Diddy has pleaded not guilty to the charges, if he&#8217;s convicted, he could face up to life in prison.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">US District Judge Arun Subramanian told jurors that the trial could last around eight weeks, although this is subject to change. On May 14, Combs&#8217; ex-girlfriend and pop star Cassie Ventura took to the stand to testify against him.&#160;&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-cassie-ventura&#8217;s-testimony-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Cassie Ventura&#8217;s testimony&#160;</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Cassie&#8217;s testimony provided harrowing details of their decade-long relationship, alleging a pattern of abuse and control.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to court transcripts, she described being coerced into drug-fueled sexual encounters at the &#8220;freak offs,&#8221; often involving male escorts and substances like MDMA to help her &#8220;disassociate.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Cassie also discussed a key piece of evidence that was shown to the jury: video footage of a 2016 incident at a Los Angeles hotel in which Combs is seen beating and dragging her.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">She testified that she initially tried to resist his violence but soon learned that this intensified the abuse. She also revealed that Combs forced her to call him &#8220;Pop Pop&#8221; during these encounters, further emphasizing the control he exerted over her.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Control was everything, from the way that I looked, to what I was working on that day, who I was speaking to,&#8221; she told the court (via <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/entertainment/takeaways-cassie-ventura-testimony-sean-combs">CNN</a>).&#160;</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Cassie stated that she was left with &#8220;bruises all over my body&#8221; as a result of his abuse, adding, &#8220;He would smash me in my head, knock me over, drag me, kick me, stomp me in the head if I was down.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Regarding the &#8220;freak offs,&#8221; she testified, &#8220;It&#8217;s his fantasy. He was controlling the whole situation, he was directing it.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">These events allegedly became a weekly occurrence. &#8220;It got to a point where I just didn&#8217;t feel like I had much of a choice, didn&#8217;t really know what &#8216;no&#8217; could be or what &#8216;no&#8217; could turn into,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The &#8216;freak offs&#8217; became a job, where there was no space to do anything else but to recover and just try to feel normal again.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Cassie went on to say that the 2016 incident happened after she attempted to leave one of the parties before it was &#8220;over.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">She said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure what happened, but I got hit by Sean and I had a black eye, and at that point all I could think about was getting out of there safely&#8230; It got violent and I chose to leave.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Sean followed me into the hallway by the elevators, he grabbed me, threw me on the ground, kicked me, tried to drag me back to the room, took my stuff.&#8221;</p>
