<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rockstar&#8217;s Red Dead Redemption 2 is reportedly getting a Switch 2 port alongside upgrades for PS5 and Xbox Series X.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In 2018, Rockstar shocked the video game world when it released its last major hit in the form of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/red-dead-redemption/">Red Dead Redemption</a> 2, a prequel to 2010&#8217;s RDR.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">RDR2 would go on to become one of the highest acclaimed games ever, earning perfect scores across the board, and is ranked second on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/best-games-all-time-2855973/">Dexerto&#8217;s top 100 games of all time list</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Perhaps surprisingly, Rockstar has yet to upgrade the game for modern consoles, but that&#8217;s reportedly going to change as early as this year in the form of a &#8220;next-gen upgrade patch.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="h-rdr2-set-to-get-huge-upgrade-on-current-gen-consoles" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">RDR2 set to get huge upgrade on current gen consoles</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-red-dead-redemption-2-for-nintendo-switch-2-may-arrive-this-year-1544753/">Gamereactor</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://nintenduo.com/exclusiva-red-dead-redemption-2-version-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintenduo</a>, Rockstar is looking to release RDR2 on Switch 2 as soon as 2025.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">They claim that the port could arrive around the same time as a planned &#8220;next-gen upgrade patch&#8221; on current consoles.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This would mean RDR2 wouldn&#8217;t be getting a revamped rerelease on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X, but rather, a patch would go live improving the title&#8217;s backward compatibility.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s claimed that both graphics and performance would be getting enhanced with the patch.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rockstar&#8217;s parent company, Take-Two Interactive, has indicated plans to bring its titles to Nintendo&#8217;s new platform, with WWE 2K, NBA 2K, Borderlands 4 and Civilization VII coming to Switch 2.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We&#8217;re offering more on launch support than ever before for a Nintendo platform. We&#8217;ve announced four titles for Switch 2. It remains to be seen how it does, but I am a big believer,&#8221; Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick told <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-id-argue-rockstar-has">The Game Business</a>.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Historically, Nintendo has done a better and more supportive job with first-party titles. But I think they are aiming to change that. And we have basically risen to the challenge and opportunity, and we&#8217;ll see how it goes. We voted with our feet. Nintendo has asked us to be supportive, and we do believe we&#8217;re doing that. Now we will see what happens.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This Red Dead report comes just days after an insider claimed <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-insider-doubles-down-on-gta-4-re-release-but-dont-get-too-excited-3195759/">GTA 4 would be getting rereleased</a> on modern consoles.</p>
