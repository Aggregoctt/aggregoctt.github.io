<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;ve all been there; somehow, we <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/uber-driver-saves-passenger-locked-out-of-her-home-this-is-pure-dad-energy-2456889/">find ourselves locked out</a> of our house, our car, or in this streamer&#8217;s case, our own bedroom.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a pinch, folks have done all sorts of things to get back into their property or residence &#8212; whether that be <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/airbnb-guests-under-fire-for-smashing-door-after-getting-locked-out-of-house-2331959/">breaking a window</a> or even getting a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itgirl_/video/7494401688334535982">pet to open the door</a> for them, people have found increasingly clever ways to circumvent locking themselves out.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One Twitch streamer found an especially ingenious way to get back into his bedroom after accidentally locking himself out during a broadcast on May 18, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-streamer-broadcasts-8-hour-attempt-to-unlock-his-room" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Streamer broadcasts 8-hour attempt to unlock his room</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">ERBY was in the middle of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2461709431?t=10h9m12s">streaming Fallout 4</a> when he stepped out for a moment. Confused fans were suddenly treated to a different view when he switched his camera to his mobile phone, showing that he&#8217;d somehow locked himself out of his room.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;What happened?&#8221; he asked his chat forlornly, jiggling the handle unsuccessfully. &#8220;It just locked on its own.&#8221;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Determined to get back inside without calling a locksmith, ERBY tried a bevy of different methods to get back in, attempting to pick the lock with a bobby pin, a flathead screwdriver, a rubber band and even paperclips.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Viewers chimed in with tips to try and help him out &#8212; but in the end, he cut off part of a plastic water bottle and shimmied it between the lock and the doorjamb, successfully getting back into his room.</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The entire process took about eight grueling hours, something the streamer claimed he viewed as a personal challenge due to his &#8220;stubborn&#8221; nature.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I really wanted to do it,&#8221; he wrote in a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1kpn8ew/streamer_locks_himself_out_of_his_room_spends_8/">comment on Reddit</a>. &#8220;I looked at it like a challenge I needed to overcome, haha. Everyone was telling me to use the bottle for like the last four hours. I ended up passing out in my car for like two hours and when I woke up I was like, &#8216;F**k it! Where&#8217;s the bottle at!'&#8221;</p>
