<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-devils-plan-season-2-winner-netflix-3197183/">winner of The Devil&#8217;s Plan Season 2</a> was crowned in the finale this week, with attention now turning to whether there&#8217;ll be a Season 3 on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a>.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-streaming-services-2641341/">streaming service</a> has been padding out its competition show content, The Devil&#8217;s Plan stands out thanks to its smart game design and cast of contestants who bring serious brainpower to the table.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Season 2 was officially subtitled Death Room thanks to a new twist, which saw half of the lowest-ranking players sent to prison for a death match separate to the main games.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over the course of the show, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-devils-plan-season-2-death-game-cast-contestants-netflix-3189934/">the cast</a> was whittled down from 14 to just one winner: Jung Hyun-gyu, who took home the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-devils-plan-prize-season-2-winner-fund-explained-3192685/">380 million won ($277,000) prize pot</a>. Now Season 2 is over, here&#8217;s what we know about a potential return.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-devil&#8217;s-plan-season-3-happening?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Is The Devil&#8217;s Plan Season 3 happening?</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Netflix is yet to officially green-light The Devil&#8217;s Plan Season 3, but it&#8217;s looking likely for two reasons: its viewership figures and comments from creator Jung Jong-yeon.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to the streaming service, Season 2 earned 1.7 million views within its first week, landing a spot in the global top 10 non-English series. What&#8217;s more, it made it to the top 10 charts in six countries, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Morocco.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In South Korea, it made it to first place. These figures could very well urge Netflix to renew the series for another season.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If it does go ahead, Jong-yeon&#160;&#8211; the creator of other popular reality shows The Genius, Society Game, and The Great Escape &#8211;&#160;is certainly keen.&#160;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking at the Blue Dragon Series Awards last year, he said, &#8220;While it&#8217;s great to see cast members win awards, my goal is to create something lasting. I want us to win Best Program.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I hope Netflix continues to value what we&#8217;re building and allows us to keep making more seasons.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Also, don&#8217;t panic that it hasn&#8217;t been renewed just yet. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-devils-plan-finale-who-was-the-grand-prize-winner-2330647/">Season 1</a> finished on October 10, 2023, with Season 2 getting the green light nearly a month later, on November 7, 2023.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If it follows this same pattern, we can expect to hear about The Devil&#8217;s Plan Season 3 mid-to-late June. However, if it does get the go-ahead, viewers want there to be a big change.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-fans-share-hopes-for-season-3-after-twist-backlash" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Fans share hopes for Season 3 after twist backlash</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ever since Season 2&#8217;s debut, many viewers have felt that the odds were stacked against the prisoners. But this criticism reached fever pitch in the final episodes, when Jung Hyun-gyu requested his hidden stage reward: 10 pieces.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This not only meant he avoided prison but also landed him a spot in the final match. The hidden stage also posed little risk for whoever took part, as losing did not result in an elimination.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For many fans of the show, it was emblematic of a wider issue with the balance between players. Over on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDevilsPlan/comments/1kta7gw/credits_to_this_korean_comment/">Reddit</a>, one wrote, &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand why they put a living room secret reward. NO ELIMINATION, NO RISK, HIGH REWARD.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I mean why is there even a hidden stage in the living quarters in the first place? That&#8217;s already too much if you ask me,&#8221; another agreed.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A third added, &#8220;The season needed a sacrifice. And that sacrifice should have been Hyun-gu accepting the 6v1, coming last, and using his reward to escape elimination. The result would have been similar except for Kyuhyun or So-hee going to prison and someone else being eliminated.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A fourth chimed in, &#8220;Honestly that sacrifice could have been in the color card game had it been properly designed.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When discussing The Devil&#8217;s Plan Season 3, one viewer <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDevilsPlan/comments/1koqasi/will_there_be_a_season_3/">said</a>, &#8220;One downside of this season was that the hidden stages were too easy to find. For Season 3, it would be great to have more hidden stages or secret advantages to add more drama.&#160;</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Maybe different players could receive different advantages for the main match &#8211;&#160;that could really shake things up! Just a suggestion though.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Alongside the format, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/singles-inferno-season-4-netflix-hosts-3031805/">Single&#8217;s Inferno host</a> Kyuhyun faced backlash from fans due to his gameplay, with many accusing him of being more focused on alliances and showmanship than solving challenges.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This reached new heights in Episode 10, when he was accused of being rude and dismissive towards Kang Ji-young.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-entertainment/2025/05/22/TPNEDQGQ3NFQFHFVBQO7CYVCMA/">Chosun Biz</a>, the former Super Junior singer has since responded to the backlash on a community forum. &#8220;It must have been difficult to capture everything in the broadcast. I&#8217;m also quite disappointed with many things,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I&#8217;ll share more details later. Don&#8217;t be too upset; the participants have a really strong bond. We understand each other well and have a good relationship, so please view this positively.&#8221;</p>
