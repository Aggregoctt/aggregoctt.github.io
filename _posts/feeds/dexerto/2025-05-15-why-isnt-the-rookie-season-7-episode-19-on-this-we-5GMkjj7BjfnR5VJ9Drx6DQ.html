<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We had two huge cliffhangers in the season finale, kicking off with Tim and Lucy&#8217;s rocky relationship.

Tim asks Lucy to move in with him, but there&#8217;s a problem &#8211; Lucy fell asleep, having missed the entire speech. Where does their relationship go from here&#8230; if anywhere? </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Elsewhere, secrets have been stolen from an NSA facility, meaning someone leveraged information to get immunity. Annoyingly for the team, that person is Monica, walking past them as a free woman to their disbelief. Whatever information she has, though, is something we don&#8217;t yet learn. </p><h2 class="text-note-4 bg-vertical-primary font-display text-neutral-white rounded-[5px] rounded-b-none px-3 font-bold uppercase text">Related</h2><p class="text-label-3 font-body font-bold text-neutral-black dark:text-neutral-white"><a class="hover:underline" href="/tv-movies/1923-season-2-finale-sooner-than-you-think-3176490/">The 1923 Season 2 finale episode is coming sooner than you think</a></p>
