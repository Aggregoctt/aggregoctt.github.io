<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Kai Cenat has addressed Adin Ross&#8217; claim that top streamers no longer interact with each other due to &#8220;ego,&#8221; as many fans of the Twitch star assumed the shade was thrown his way.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Since being unbanned from Twitch, Adin Ross has thrown plenty of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/adin-ross-shades-twitch-streamers-who-abandoned-him-during-two-year-ban-3174580/">shade at the streamers who &#8216;abandoned&#8217; him along the way</a>. The main names that have been mentioned are Kai Cenat and IShowSpeed, with the KICK star constantly addressing his relationship with Kai.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In his return to Twitch,<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/adin-ross-addresses-kai-cenat-beef-and-his-toxic-fans-in-twitch-return-3173822/"> Adin claimed that he doesn&#8217;t have any issues with Kai</a>, but has said some things that fans have assumed are shots at the AMP star and made them rethink things.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That includes him joining B.Lou and Zias on stream to say that &#8220;the top streamers are not friends&#8221; anymore. &#8220;I&#8217;m serious, that&#8217;s the problem. It used to be, everyone was like, always doing content together. Always doing s**t together. Game nights. Nobody&#8217;s friends anymore. Everyone, like, is not f**king anymore. I&#8217;m telling you how it feels like. Everyone&#8217;s egos is colliding. It&#8217;s ego. You know, I don&#8217;t understand that,&#8221; Adin said.&#160;</p> 



 



<h2 id="h-kai-responds-to-adin&#8217;s-claim-that-nobody-works-together-on-twitch-anymore" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Kai responds to Adin&#8217;s claim that nobody works together on Twitch anymore</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With fans assuming that Kai was being shaded with that statement, it didn&#8217;t take long before the Twitch star had to address it on stream.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I feel like sh*t now really is as easy as, like, doing sh*t because n****s do be busy,&#8221; Kai said. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t going to lie, you all know me. I don&#8217;t got no ego to nobody. I&#8217;m just literally streaming, gang.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He quickly blamed &#8220;those accounts&#8221; for hamming up the drama and &#8220;build narratives&#8221; about things.&#160;</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Yo chat, it&#8217;s literally those accounts that build the narrative. Let me emphasize it &#8211; those accounts. Y&#8217;all know that builds up narratives,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I&#8217;m telling you, gang! I&#8217;m telling you, gang! Those accounts that build that narrative. That&#8217;s literally what it is, gang. And that s**t is too toxic, gang. Way too toxic, bro.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The pair have not interacted on stream for quite some time, and doing so would, obviously, squash quite a few claims.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">They both regularly interact with other big creators. Kai streams alongside his AMP crew and IShowSpeed quite often, while Adin has constantly collabed with Sneako and Logan Paul.</p>
