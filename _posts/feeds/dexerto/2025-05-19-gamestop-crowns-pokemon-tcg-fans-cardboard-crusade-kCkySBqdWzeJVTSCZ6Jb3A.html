<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The hobby, which has seen prices for new releases soar due to huge demand and not enough supply in 2025, has also been <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/pokemon-retailer-takes-drastic-measures-to-combat-prismatic-evolutions-scalpers-3029143/">subject to heavy scalping</a>, driving prices up even further.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Released on January 17, sealed products for special set <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-most-expensive-cards-3033115/">Prismatic Evolutions</a> remain incredibly hard to source at retail price. The Pokemon Company previously <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-pokemon-company-responds-to-prismatic-evolutions-stock-shortage-3032288/">confirmed it would be printing more</a> of the set &#8220;at maximum capacity&#8221; as well as releasing new products to meet demand.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Prismatic&#8217;s <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/pokemon-tcg-release-2629243/">Super Premium Collection</a>, released on May 16, is one example of the latter, and consumers not wanting to risk leaving empty-handed queued up outside GameStop stores days before they went on sale.</p>



<h2 id="h-gamestop-&#8220;salutes&#8221;-pokemon-fans&#8217;-dedication" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">GameStop &#8220;salutes&#8221; Pokemon fans&#8217; dedication</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 16, accompanied by images of customers camping outside stores, GameStop released an open letter to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1923233539006357668">Pokemon fans on X</a>, praising the &#8220;brave, shivering, Red Bull-fueled heroes camping outside Chicago store #402.&#8221;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We at GameStop understand that Pokemon isn&#8217;t just a card game,&#8221; the letter continued, adding, &#8220;It&#8217;s a lifestyle, a calling, an, at times, financially irresponsible obsession that brings us all together.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Since 2024, GameStop has expanded its involvement in Pokemon by stocking graded cards alongside sealed products and allows customers to submit high-value cards of their own in-store to PSA.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In February, the retail chain <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/gamestop-halts-all-pokemon-tcg-pre-orders-and-collectors-are-furious-3141374/">discontinued pre-orders for TCG products</a> and implemented purchase limits in order to &#8220;ensure more fans have the opportunity to experience these exciting releases, rather than limiting access to early buyers and resellers.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Other major Pokemon TCG vendors, both online and in brick-and-mortar stores, have instituted similar restrictions with the same aims, including the official Pokemon Center website.</p>
