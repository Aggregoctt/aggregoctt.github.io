<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Get ready to saddle up at 35,000 feet: standing-seats on flights are coming, and soon.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Budget airlines are preparing to roll out standing-only &#8220;seats&#8221; as early as 2026, in a push to cram more passengers on short-haul flights and cut ticket prices, according to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://euroweeklynews.com/2025/05/21/low-cost-airlines-to-launch-standing-only-seats-in-2026/">Euro Weekly</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The concept comes from Italian manufacturer Aviointeriors, which unveiled the Skyrider 2.0, a vertical seat, with a saddle section that looks like something from a bicycle.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">These new seats would allow up to 20% more passengers per flight and could, in theory, drop ticket prices significantly. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ryanair CEO Michael O&#8217;Leary, long known for his cost-cutting initiatives, has supported the concept for a while, saying people who want cheap travel should be willing to stand.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ryanair floated a similar plan over a decade ago but got <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/28/ryanair-standing-only-plane-tickets-regulator">shut down by regulators</a>. Now, with updated designs and renewed interest from budget carriers, the Skyrider may finally take off&#8230; if it passes safety checks.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Aviointeriors claims that the Skyrider 2.0 &#8220;passes every safety test &#8211; with rapid-exit drills and all,&#8221; according to Euro Weekly.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Unsurprisingly, prospective flyers are split. Some call it a genius move for budget travelers; others are calling it a dystopian nightmare.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The tickets will definitely be mad cheap. If that&#8217;s the case, those tickets will sell. I see the vision,&#8221; one commenter on X said.</p>
