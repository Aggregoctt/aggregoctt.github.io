<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After the second <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/gta-6/">GTA 6</a> trailer revealed plenty of new information about the story, fans have already begun coming up with theories about one of the main characters, Jason, and his backstory. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rockstar recently announced that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-officially-delayed-until-2026-3189190/">GTA 6 won&#8217;t be arriving until May 2026</a>, much to the disappointment of many fans. However, in an effort to keep the community satisfied for the next year, they also dropped a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-trailer-2-finally-reveals-more-story-details-3190524/">second trailer</a> and launched a website full of screenshots and extra details. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As you&#8217;d expect, fans have been poring over them, looking for any hidden details about the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/gta-6/">story</a> and its <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/all-confirmed-gta-6-characters-3190548/">characters</a>. This has led to an interesting theory about <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-fans-are-convinced-they-recognize-jasons-voice-actor-3190600/">Jason Duval</a>, one of the playable protagonists, as some are convinced that he may be an undercover cop.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-fans-convinced-jason-is-an-undercover-cop" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">GTA 6 fans convinced Jason is an undercover cop</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Most Grand Theft Auto games are about avoiding the police while you commit increasingly ambitious crimes. However, there are several details in the second GTA 6 trailer that we may be playing as a cop this time around, and many fans are convinced.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Some of the biggest clues are shots where Jason is seen to be wearing tactical gear, which could have been given to him by the authorities. There are also scenes where to cops are talking, and it looks as though Jason is in the room at the same time &#8212; and not in handcuffs. </p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On top of all that, a couple of lines of dialogue also raise questions about his backstory. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At the start of the trailer, the receptionist of the prison holding Lucia asks Jason: &#8220;Have I seen you here before?&#8221; implying that he&#8217;s either visited her in the past, or that he&#8217;s someone who goes to the prison for work. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One character even asks directly if he&#8217;s a fed, which suggests that he&#8217;s not exactly trusted by Vice City&#8217;s underworld. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If this turns out to be true, it&#8217;s not exactly clear what his intentions are, given that he&#8217;s set to spend a lot of time with Lucia doing things outside of the law. Maybe he&#8217;s investigating her, or even using her to get to some of her associates. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But if this theory is right, the relationship and &#8220;trust&#8221; established between the two could make for a heartbreaking twist at some point in the story when Lucia finds out.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Another theory, posted by &#8216;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1kic1bz/jason_not_a_cop_but_working_with_cops/">sidewinda98</a>&#8216; on Reddit, argues that Jason isn&#8217;t actually a cop himself but is working with the police. The few looks at the police officers in the trailer don&#8217;t make them seem exactly clean, so the OP suggests that they might be setting up raids and robberies in exchange for some of the cash.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Either way, all the signs from the trailer point towards some kind of relationship between Jason and the police, but it remains to be seen how deep that goes. So far, all Rockstar have shared about his backstory is that he spent some time in the army before working for local drug runners, and that he&#8217;s looking to &#8220;try something new.&#8221; </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Of course, this is all just speculation from a couple of trailers, so take it with a pinch of salt until we finally get our hands on GTA 6 in 2026. </p>
