<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Twitch&#8217;s ad revenue is apparently at an &#8220;all-time low,&#8221; according to streamers Knut and Mizkif, with Knut using KICK to make up some of the difference.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Successful content creators have plenty of different revenue streams, but the majority of streamers rely on Twitch subscriptions and ad revenue. Both fluctuate quite a bit, which can cause a fair few down months for creators.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;ve seen this in the past, most notably with YouTube&#8217;s &#8216;adpocalypse&#8217; in 2017, as advertisers wanted a shift towards family-friendly content. It happened again in 2019 too, with major brands like Disney, Epic Games, and Nestle pulling advertising on the site for a significant period.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the last few months,<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/three-major-companies-pull-twitch-ads-amid-antisemitism-allegations-2998572/"> a number of big companies have reportedly walked away </a>from Twitch as well. Chevron confirmed they&#8217;d pulled advertising and issued a statement condemning &#8220;hurtful&#8221; comments made at a TwitchCon panel.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-knut-&amp;-mizkif-record-&#8220;all-time-low&#8221;-ad-revenue-on-twitch" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Knut &amp; Mizkif record &#8220;all-time low&#8221; ad revenue on Twitch</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Some streamers have<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/what-is-the-twitch-adpocalypse-and-what-does-it-mean-for-streamers-2983149/"> feared an adpocalypse on the Amazon-owned platform</a>, and according to Knut, advertiser revenue has dropped to an &#8220;all-time low&#8221; for some streamers.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Ad revenue is an all-time low,&#8221; the Norwegian streamer <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://kick.com/knut/clips/clip_01JVNJNFT5KN3TFF7GAAKV45ZD">said</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s not down to zero, this (graphic) is a little bit overdone, this is a little bit exaggerated. It isn&#8217;t cut down to 10%, but it is down.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I talked to Mizkif about it yesterday as well, and he said he looked at his and when he saw his dashboard, his ad revenue compared to before is so s*it. But it&#8217;s good that we have KICK as well that we can help us.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Both Twitch and KICK have allowed multi-streaming across different platforms now. However, doing <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/kick/kick-stars-can-now-multi-stream-on-twitch-youtube-but-theres-a-big-catch-3180826/">so will limit the revenue you can make on the Stake-backed platform by up to 50%.</a></p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There is also the issue of splitting your community across different locations. You may lose viewers if you abandon one specific platform, thus losing out on revenue too.</p>
