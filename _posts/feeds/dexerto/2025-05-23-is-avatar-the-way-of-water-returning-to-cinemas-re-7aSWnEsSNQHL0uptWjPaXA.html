<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/avatar-3-release-date-name-trailer-cast-plot-more-2000629/">Avatar 3</a> is due to hit cinemas later this year, and if you&#8217;ve been craving Pandora&#8217;s return to the big screen, we have good news about Avatar: The Way of Water. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">James Cameron is the self-declared king of the world for good reason: he directed three out of the top five <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/top-50-highest-grossing-movies-of-all-time-1856841/">highest-grossing movies of all time</a> (Titanic, The Way of Water, and the first <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/avatar/">Avatar</a>). </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">And, yet, people continue to doubt Avatar, even though the sequel &#8211; released a whopping 13 years after the original film &#8211;&#160;made over $2 billion, and (at least) three more entries are in the works, including this year&#8217;s <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/avatar-3-will-prove-james-cameron-is-still-the-king-of-the-world-3126502/">Avatar: Fire and Ash</a>. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The threequel is expected to release in theaters in December, but there&#8217;s still no trailer. Don&#8217;t worry, though, because 20th Century Studios has just the thing to put your mind at ease. </p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Avatar: The Way of Water will return to cinemas on Friday, October 3 for a &#8220;one-week limited engagement.&#8221;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This is expected to be a global rollout, echoing the re-release of Avatar in 2022 (which made over $76 million worldwide, taking the first film&#8217;s total haul to $2.9 billion).</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Here&#8217;s the best bit: it&#8217;ll be re-released in IMAX and 3D screens, so you can see it the way it was intended (if you&#8217;re unsure, read more about the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/avatar-2-best-way-to-watch-imax-3d-hfr-plf-4k-explained-2004899/">best way to watch Avatar 2 with our guide</a>). This comes after Michael, a biopic about Michael Jackson, was delayed to 2026, freeing up an IMAX slot.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fans are delighted, obviously, but they have one question: why isn&#8217;t there a teaser trailer for Avatar 3 yet?  &#8220;At this point, I don&#8217;t believe Avatar is out this year unless they drop the trailer,&#8221; one user <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://x.com/JoelDaCatDad/status/1925700196463210896">speculated</a>. </p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">To be clear, that seems highly unlikely. 20th Century Studios wouldn&#8217;t green-light a re-release of Fire and Ash&#8217;s predecessor unless it was on track for its December release date. Looking ahead, Disney&#8217;s next major release is Elio on June 20 &#8211; there&#8217;s a good chance the first teaser for Avatar 3 will be attached to it in cinemas, or perhaps even Fantastic Four: First Steps in July. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;WHERE THE HELL IS THE TRAILER FOR AVATAR: FIRE AND ASH?!?? When Way of Water came out, the trailer dropped in theaters along Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness?? So, WHERE IS IT??&#8221; another fan <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://x.com/graysonmingi/status/1925540090811449797">pointed out</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t we be getting an Avatar 3 teaser trailer in front of Lilo &amp; Stitch or something???&#8221; a third <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://x.com/michaelabina/status/1925317450385825835">asked</a>.</p>
