<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Logan Paul might have scored his next big boxing match after one of Lionel Messi&#8217;s bodyguards responded to his offer for a bare-knuckle street fight.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/">YouTube</a> star turned <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/wwe/">WWE</a> Heel <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/logan-paul/">Logan Paul</a> has been embroiled in a legal battle with Lionel Messi&#8217;s drink brand Mas+ over the last year, with Mas+ suing Prime Hydration over &#8216;<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/messis-drink-company-sues-logan-paul-ksis-prime-hydration-over-anti-competitive-claims-2924071/">anti-competitive business practices</a>&#8216; and Prime counter-suing for <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/food/prime-hydration-countersues-messis-drink-company-over-bottle-design-2987866/">trademark infringement</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As a result of the dispute, Paul called out Messi for a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/logan-paul-calls-out-lionel-messi-for-boxing-match-to-settle-prime-lawsuit-dispute-3130480/">potential boxing match</a> &#8212; and while he later admitted it was <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/logan-paul-admits-messi-fight-callout-was-a-joke-amid-prime-hydration-lawsuit-3150687/">merely a joke</a>, one of the footballer&#8217;s bodyguards decided to step in.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In March 2025, Yassine Chueko posted a video on Instagram directly challenging Paul to fisticuffs. When alerted to the video, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/logan-paul-responds-after-messis-bodyguard-challenges-him-to-a-boxing-match-3171489/">Paul scoffed</a>, telling him to &#8220;get in line,&#8221; but welcomed him to fly to Puerto Rico and put his skills to the test.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In April, Paul revealed that he&#8217;d turned down a $15 million offer to box the bodyguard, saying that he has dedicated his life to the WWE and that he wasn&#8217;t accepting any outside offers. However, he was game for a bareknuckle street fight.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;You wanna pull up on me in your free time? We&#8217;re fighting in Puerto Rico, bare fists, no mouth guard. Pull up and fight me,&#8221; Paul suggested during <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/logan-paul-agrees-to-japan-stream-with-adin-ross-on-one-condition-3190172/">Adin Ross&#8217;s Kick stream</a> in May.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Chueko has now responded to Paul&#8217;s offer &#8212; but he&#8217;s still gunning for an official boxing match against the pro wrestler.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-messi&#8217;s-bodyguard-doubles-down-on-boxing-offer" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Messi&#8217;s bodyguard doubles down on boxing offer</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Shortly after Paul&#8217;s counter-offer, Chueko posted a video of himself training on Instagram, urging the YouTuber to buckle down and sign a contract.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;You&#8217;re so cute with your blonde hair,&#8221; the bodyguard taunted after hitting the mitts. &#8220;Why you getting nervous? Stop the drama, Lolo.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;You are not a gangster, Lola, and I am not a kid. We are not gonna fight on the street. So now, sign the contract, Lolo. &#8230;Stop excuses, sign the contract. But I promise, I&#8217;m not gonna knock you out in the first round. Take it easy, Lolo.&#8221;</p> 



 
 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Given Paul&#8217;s previous stance on taking a big-money boxing match, fans aren&#8217;t convinced he&#8217;ll agree to Chueko&#8217;s offer &#8212; but there&#8217;s another member of the Paul family who has committed himself to becoming a world champion boxer.</p>
