<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fortnite&#8217;s 35,20 patch is set to bring the Mandalorian Rising update to the game, and here are all the details you need to know about it.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Much like any other season, Epic tends to drop major updates that span throughout the entire season to keep things exciting. In the previous Chapter 6, Season 3 update, we&#8217;ve seen the Battle Royale island getting even more chaotic, as players were able to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/fortnite-players-can-now-speak-to-darth-vader-thanks-to-new-ai-chatbot-update-3196529/">interact with AI Darth Vader</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With that in mind, according to the previously revealed <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/full-star-wars-update-schedule-in-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-3186591/">schedule</a>, we&#8217;ll still be getting two more updates before the season ends to look forward to, with the third, or the next one, set to be patch 35.20.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Also dubbed as &#8220;Mandalorian Rising&#8221;, there&#8217;ll be a plethora of exciting additions that Star Wars fans and players can dive into. Though the patch is not live yet at the time of writing, we&#8217;ve compiled everything that&#8217;s coming next, based on official info and leaks.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The 35.20 update in Chapter 6, Season 3 is set to release on <strong>May 22, 2025</strong>. As for the time itself, while it&#8217;s still yet to be confirmed as of now, looking at previous updates, it&#8217;ll likely drop at 1:00 AM PDT / 4:00 AM EDT / 9:00 AM GMT.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Of course, as usual, a maintenance period before the update goes live is expected. Generally, this can take a few hours.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, on rare occasions, it could take longer or even <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/fortnites-app-store-return-delayed-as-apple-keeps-them-waiting-3195822/">be delayed</a>, such as the case with the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/fortnite-35-10-patch-notes-3194066/">previous patch</a>, due to the situation with Apple. We&#8217;ll be sure to update this section once more information emerges.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-mandalorian-skin-&amp;-npc" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">New Mandalorian skin &amp; NPC</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One of the most anticipated changes is the Mandalorian skin, which is speculated to drop with this patch.&#160;</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Not to be confused with the existing Mandalorian skin that&#8217;s locked behind the Chapter 2, Season 5 Battle Pass, this will be an entirely new cosmetic that&#8217;s customizable, meaning you can change different parts of the skin to mix and match the look you want.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1924163078352199683">leak</a>, there&#8217;s a possibility that there&#8217;ll be a female version of this skin as well. Though, do take this information with a grain of salt for now.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Gameplay-wise, it&#8217;s confirmed that Mandalorians will finally intervene on the island, allowing you to recruit a Heavy, Scout, Supply, or Medic Mandalorian to your team. Talk about getting a Victory Royale easily.</p>



<h2 id="h-mandalorian-jetpack-returns" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Mandalorian Jetpack returns</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">First introduced in Chapter 2, Season 5, the Mandalorian Jetpack will be unvaulted in this update. This utility item basically lets you hover as well as fly upwards in the air, which is perfect to take down pesky enemies who camp high grounds and builds.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Assuming nothing changes, though, this will also take up fuel, so you can&#8217;t always use it all the time.</p>



<h2 id="h-amban-sniper-rifle-&amp;-westar-34-blaster-pistols" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Amban Sniper Rifle &amp; WESTAR-34 Blaster Pistols</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Another thing that&#8217;s returning from Chapter 2, Season 5 is the Amba Sniper Rifle. It&#8217;s a single-shot gun that provides a Thermal Scope that can be used both for long-range and melee.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On the other hand,&#160; WESTAR-34 Blaster Pistols will be a completely new weapon that&#8217;s also a signature of the Mandalorian.</p>



<h2 id="h-possible-live-event-leaks" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Possible live event leaks</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/FortniteFNLK/status/1924526154234413260">leaker</a>, we could be getting more live event leaks or details when the patch comes. With the game adding one more update after this, it&#8217;s also safe to assume that Epic will likely give out teasers for the next live event, and possibly Chapter 6, Season 4.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So far, we know that the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/next-fortnite-live-event-when-time-2967293/">next live event</a> will drop on June 7, 2025. Called &#8220;The Final Showdown: Death Star Sabotage,&#8221; this will mark the end of the current season before moving on to the next one.</p>
