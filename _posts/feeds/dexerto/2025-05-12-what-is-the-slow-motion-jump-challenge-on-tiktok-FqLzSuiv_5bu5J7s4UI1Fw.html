<div>
<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One of the latest trends sweeping across social media has users roasting themselves for how they look while jumping up and down in slow motion.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s no shortage of hilarious challenges that go viral online, but a recent craze taking over platforms like <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tiktok/">TikTok</a>, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> and X is humbling people big-time.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The challenge doesn&#8217;t have an official name, but it&#8217;s generally known as the &#8216;slow mo jump&#8217; trend, where someone will film themselves jumping in slow motion and pause on a close-up of their face.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The goal is to stay as stone-faced as possible to stop yourself from having an unflattering moment in front of the camera during the jump &#8212; but it&#8217;s basically physically impossible, no matter how hard you try.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The resulting footage is nothing short of hilarious. When falling down from the jump, gravity takes over, pulling people&#8217;s facial skin and muscles down in ways that some users have jokingly compared to Bloodhounds or Shar Pei dogs.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Videos compiling the best &#8216;slow motion jump&#8217; clips have started going viral online as of mid-May 2025, but the trend has been around for years prior.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In 2022, for instance, music artist Riley Clemmons got over 200K views on TikTok for uploading a compilation of herself and friends&#8217; faces as they jumped in slow motion, leaving viewers crying with laughter.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The funny fad is still going strong three years later, proving that everyone looks unflattering in certain circumstances.</p>
