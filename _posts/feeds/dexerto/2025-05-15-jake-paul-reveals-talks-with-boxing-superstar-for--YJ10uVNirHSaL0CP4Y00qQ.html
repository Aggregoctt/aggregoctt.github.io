<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Jake Paul has revealed that a boxing champion wants to fight him inside the PFL cage for an MMA match-up, but it might not happen just yet.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With the majority of wins on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/jake-paul-boxing-record-all-opponents-fight-results-so-far-1891473/">Jake Paul&#8217;s boxing record </a>coming against former Mixed Martial Artists, it is no surprise that the YouTuber-turned-boxer wants to try his hand in cagefighting.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/jake-paul-signs-deal-for-mma-debut-pfl-2024366/">The &#8216;Problem Child&#8217; penned a multi-year deal with the PFL </a>&#8211; Professional Fighters League &#8211; back in 2023, but he has still yet to make his debut. Jake&#8217;s win over Mike Tyson was supposed to be the point in which he switched his focus to MMA, however, that hasn&#8217;t happene, seeing as <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/boxing/someone-bought-a-1m-ticket-to-jake-paul-vs-chavez-jr-heres-what-it-includes-3195667/">he&#8217;s fighting Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. on June 28.&#160;</a></p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Despite the continued focus on boxing, Jake has reiterated his desire to get into the cage. It always comes up during his pre-fight interviews.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-jake-paul-has-had-mma-fight-talks-with-oleksandr-usyk" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Jake Paul has had MMA fight talks with Oleksandr Usyk</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Well, during his pre-fight press conference on May 14, the social media phenom revealed that Nate Diaz is still &#8220;ducking&#8221; him, but he could go up against heavyweight boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I want to be like Holly (Holm) here and test my skills in the cage,&#8221; Jake told <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wHd0-qn4E&amp;ab_channel=FightHype.com">FightHype</a>. &#8220;That is something I am super, super interested in, and I think it would be a very, very big spectacle, but we need to find the right opponent.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">His manager, Nakisa Bidarian, quickly chimed in with Usyk&#8217;s name. &#8220;Usyk maybe,&#8221; Jake said. &#8220;Usyk has called out Jake multiple times in MMA, they&#8217;ve been in touch with us behind the scenes, telling us they want to do that fight in 2026. So, it&#8217;s something we definitely want to pursue.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>Timestamp of 6:10</strong></p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Jake also named Tommy Fury as a potential opponent, seeing as how he is still the only blemish on Jake&#8217;s record.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The pair have discussed a rematch before, either in the boxing ring or MMA cage, but it has yet to happen.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A clash with Usyk would, undoubtedly, draw the attention of the combat sports world, though. The 38-year-old is the dominant fighter in the heavyweight division, holding the disputed crown. He would be 39 before any fight with Jake were to happen, but he only has one fight on his plate now &#8211; a rematch with &#8216;Dynamite&#8217; Daniel Dubois on July 19.</p>
