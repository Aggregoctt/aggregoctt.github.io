<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One of Black Ops&#8217; most iconic game modes is returning in Black Ops 6 Season 4, but fans are worried as one big gun is still missing.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over the last few years, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/">Call of Duty </a>has increasingly cycled new playlists in and out of games. This has, at times, been to the annoyance of players as their favorite modes have disappeared without too much warning.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It has also been a chance for fans to ask for some of their other preferred modes to come back. We&#8217;ve seen them demand, and get, the return of Cyber Attack, Demolition, and<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/popular-black-ops-6-mode-is-no-longer-fun-as-fans-have-big-issues-3030227/"> Prop Hunt.</a></p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The latter is a Party Mode, which we&#8217;ve seen return to the Black Ops series multiple times. But fans have also demanded the return of One in the Chamber and Sticks and Stones for quite some time as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-cod-fans-still-need-new-gun-for-one-in-the-chamber-return" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">COD fans still need new gun for One in the Chamber return</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-season-4-update-3194203/">In Season 4</a>, One in the Chamber will finally be returning to Call of Duty. It was revealed by Treyarch as an in-season update, with the in-game logo displaying two revolvers.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While fans are excited to get the popular mode back, they believe it is still missing a signature pistol. &#8220;Bruh I swear if we get this icon but not an actual revolver,&#8221; one <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1kram9z/new_mp_mode_icons_one_in_the_chamber/">said</a>. &#8220;I just want a 1911 bro,&#8221; another added.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The revolver, as some pointed out, has been leaked in the past, but has yet to appear in-game. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t seem right to not have a revolver in a game like this,&#8221; another said. &#8220;Stoked for the LC and the FFAR, but a 1911 or revolver or any new pistol seems overdue,&#8221; <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1ksesru/okay_guys_wheres_the_revolvers_or_ballistic_knife/">commented</a> another.&#160;</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Other fans are concerned that One in the Chamber also doesn&#8217;t feel like itself as there is no way to have wager matches like Black Ops 1.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, it is another example of players demanding a classic game mode and, eventually, getting it added back.</p>
