<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After just seven episodes, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-3176859/">The Last of Us Season 2</a> will end this weekend &#8211; but some big changes could be coming in Season 3, according to Craig Mazin. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The first season was mostly a faithful adaptation of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/the-last-of-us/">The Last of Us</a>, retaining the main beats of the story while expanding others; for example, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-episode-3-bill-and-franks-relationship-explained-2036616/">the story of Bill and Frank</a> in Episode 3, widely regarded as the best episode of the entire series so far. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Season 2 came out swinging (literally) with <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-is-joel-dead-3182624/">Joel&#8217;s death</a> in the opening episodes, sending Ellie on a path of vengeance to Seattle to find Abby and her WLF crew. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It remains unclear if they&#8217;ll come face to face again in Episode 7, but you should prepare for a cliffhanger that tees up what&#8217;s coming in Season 3. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-of-us-season-3-could-be-longer-and-more-expansive-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">The Last of Us Season 3 could be longer and more expansive </h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Season 2 has made some small, notable changes to The Last of Us Part 2. For example, instead of Tommy, Dina was present at Joel&#8217;s death while Jackson fought off a horde of infected. Eugene&#8217;s death was the catalyst for Joel confessing the truth about what happened at the hospital, which is completely different from the game. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, these haven&#8217;t been major detours like Bill and Frank&#8217;s episode, something Mazin is hoping to change in Season 3. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The thing about Joel&#8217;s death is that it&#8217;s so impactful. It&#8217;s such a narrative nuclear bomb that it&#8217;s hard to wander away from it,&#8221; he told <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://collider.com/the-last-of-us-series-length-season-3-showrunner-craig-mazin/">Collider</a>. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We can&#8217;t really take a break and move off to the side and do a Bill and Frank story. I&#8217;m not sure that will necessarily be true for Season 3. I think we&#8217;ll have a little more room there.&#8221;</p>  


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Thankfully, Season 3 may be longer than seven episodes. &#8220;I think&#160;there&#8217;s a decent chance that Season 3 will be longer than Season 2, just because the manner of that narrative and the opportunities it affords us are a little different,&#8221; Mazin said. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Without any spoilers, let&#8217;s just say that Season 2 hasn&#8217;t even got halfway through the story of the game &#8211;&#160;and if things go to plan, the show will end with a fourth season. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;But certainly, there&#8217;s no way to complete this narrative in a third season. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll earn our keep enough to come back and finish it in a fourth. That&#8217;s the most likely outcome,&#8221; he added. </p>
