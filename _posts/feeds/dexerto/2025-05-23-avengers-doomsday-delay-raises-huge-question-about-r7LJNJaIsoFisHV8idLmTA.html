<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/marvel-phase-6-mcu-movies-tv-shows-2823522/">Phase Six</a> of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has undergone a huge scheduling shakeup, with <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/avengers-the-kang-dynasty-release-date-cast-plot-more-1949725/">Avengers: Doomsday</a> set to release more than seven months later. And the delay could have major consequences for <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/spider-man-4-everything-we-know-2006937/">Spider-Man 4</a>, aka Brand New Day.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Both Doomsday and its follow-up, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/avengers-secret-wars-release-date-cast-plot-more-1950442/">Avengers: Secret Wars</a>, have undergone scheduling changes. The former will now land in theaters on December 18, 2026, months after its original May 1, 2026 date.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Secret Wars, meanwhile, has been pushed back to December 17, 2027, having been originally due to land on May 7, 2027. It&#8217;s believed that the delays are to provide more time for the huge production of the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/every-marvel-cinematic-universe-movie-tv-show-in-development-1849946/">upcoming MCU movies</a>, directed by the Russo brothers.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Given they&#8217;re both Endgame-style team-up films, it shouldn&#8217;t be all that surprising that the cast and crew need more time. But the scheduling changes do raise a question about what this means for the next big <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/spider-man/">Spider-Man</a> film.</p>



<h2 id="h-spider-man-4-is-now-set-before-avengers:-doomsday" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Spider-Man 4 is now set before Avengers: Doomsday</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At the time of writing, the release date for Spider-Man 4 remains the same: July 31, 2026. Either this will be pushed back, or the new release schedule debunks the leading theory about its plot: it&#8217;s set in Battleworld.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The rumor stems from reports that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/spider-man-4-title-accidentally-gives-away-the-villain-3173764/">Brand New Day</a> would take place between Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars, during a period when the multiverse begins to collapse.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the comics, this collapse leads to the creation of Battleworld &#8211; a patchwork planet composed of fragments from different realities, ruled by a god-like version of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/robert-downey-jr-mcu-return-explained-doctor-doom-2843765/">Doctor Doom</a>. It&#8217;s central to the Secret Wars storyline, leading to speculation that the MCU will follow a similar arc.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If that&#8217;s the case, it would make sense for Spider-Man 4 to explore Peter Parker&#8217;s place in this fractured multiverse before the full chaos of Secret Wars unfolds. But with Doomsday now set after Spider-Man 4&#8217;s current release, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/marvel/">Marvel</a> may not be following this storyline after all.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Or, the studio may delay the film altogether. For now, it&#8217;s sparking a busy discussion, with industry insider Daniel Richtman chiming in.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Now that Spider-Man Brand New Day is set before Doomsday and not after, they gonna change the plot again like they did when No Way Home was supposed to come out after Doctor Strange 2,&#8221; he <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1925693184157319540">wrote</a>. &#8220;(America Chavez was going to have a major role in No Way Home before the shift).&#8221;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Elsewhere, a fan wrote on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/1kt50ga/so_officially_brand_new_day_will_be_set_before/">Reddit</a>, &#8220;Unless otherwise revealed, Brand New Day hasn&#8217;t changed its July 2026 release date, so now that Avengers: Doomsday has been confirmed for a December release, that leaves us with the conclusion that Brand New Day will be the next project after Fantastic Four.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;And as if everything we already officially knew didn&#8217;t make it obvious, the plot won&#8217;t be set on Battleworld, because it hasn&#8217;t happened yet. This would also mean there won&#8217;t be an intervening film between Doomsday and Secret Wars.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Another replied, &#8220;I personally hope it keeps the July date. This makes the chances that it&#8217;ll be a street level movie higher than ever before.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A third agreed, &#8220;Like this, it&#8217;s the correct way. I didn&#8217;t want to be in the mood of something bigger happening and Spider-Man just fighting in the streets while the world is coming to an end, as it happened with Ant-Man and Wasp&#8230; so now, we can be in the mood of a street level movie and the post-credits scene hints the coming chaos.&#8221;</p>
