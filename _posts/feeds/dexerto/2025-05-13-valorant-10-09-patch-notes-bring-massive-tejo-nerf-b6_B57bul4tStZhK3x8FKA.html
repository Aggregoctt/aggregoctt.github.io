<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Valorant update 10.09 is here, and it sees Tejo finally get some nerfs. There is also a small tweak to Breach&#8217;s stun. So, here are the patch notes.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At the start of 2025, Riot Games rang in the new year by adding another new Agent to the mix in Valorant in the form of Tejo. The Colombian Initiator, like the majority of new Agents, quickly displayed a bit more power than some of the other, thanks to his Guided Salvo ability and Armageddon ultimate.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It didn&#8217;t take long before fans were quickly calling for changes from Riot, especially when it come to his rockets taking down Killjoy&#8217;s Lockdown.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Valorant devs have already tuned his Guided Salvo, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/valorant/valorant-10-04-update-patch-notes-3155991/">nerfing it so that Killjoy&#8217;s Lockdown would survive with 5HP. </a>However, it is going back under the knife in the 10.09 patch.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Yes, that&#8217;s right, those long-awaited further changes to Tejo have hit in the new patch, with the Guided Salvo no longer recharging in the same vein as Skye&#8217;s Guiding Light.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We hear you. And we agree that Tejo has been overperforming in some factors. We&#8217;re constantly monitoring the state of our Agents and feel that Tejo&#8217;s rockets have led to higher frequency of unhealthy game states, such as Tejo&#8217;s repeated usage of his rockets being able to swing rounds without sacrificing as much compared to other Initiators,&#8221; Riot <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1922275690298138726">said</a>.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The cost of Tejo&#8217;s Stealth Drone, Special Delivery, and Armageddon are all changing too. The Stealth Drone is now 400, Special Delivery is down to 200, and Armageddon will take nine orbs instead of eight.&#160;</p>  


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As noted, Breach&#8217;s stun is also being touched in 10.09. You can find the full details in the patch notes below.</p>
