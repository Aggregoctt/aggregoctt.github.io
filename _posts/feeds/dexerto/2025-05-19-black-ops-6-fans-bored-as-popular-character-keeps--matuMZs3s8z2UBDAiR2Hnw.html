<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Black Ops 6 fans have gotten increasingly frustrated with one select character being given regular skins that are actually quite &#8220;ugly&#8221; as they just want &#8220;regular&#8221; looks.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/">Call of Duty </a>has had microtransactions, in some form or another, pretty much forever. Call of Duty 4 started things with map packs, profile photos, and a few other bits. However, they have been significantly expanded upon in recent years.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The games are now essentially live service, being updated every few days and weeks with new content. That means new skins, weapon blueprints, weapon charms, and other things as well.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The increased focus on microtransactions has annoyed a lot of players, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-players-bored-of-one-skin-and-its-not-terminator-3179872/">especially as a lot of skins have been 4/20-themed </a>and not in keeping with Call of Duty&#8217;s usual military-sim vibes.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-players-want-normal-adler-skins" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Black Ops 6 players want normal Adler skins</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Yet, the newest complaint from fans is about one character in particular &#8211; Adler &#8211; being the focus of skins that are quite &#8220;ugly&#8221; in design.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Not only is this skin ugly, but you gotta love how COD claims it&#8217;s a new operator,&#8221; Redditor C0R3VUS <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1kps34a/not_only_is_this_skin_ugly_but_you_gotta_love_how/">said</a>, pointing to the Archie&#8217;s Day Out ultra skin for Adler. &#8220;Adler has been in the game since launch through Vault Edition. Even after that, they already made one store bundle for him.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Others quickly agreed. &#8220;they gotta stop giving adler these fuckass skins,&#8221; one said. &#8220;THAT&#8217;S the new Adler skin?? Damn can&#8217;t he just get a single outfit from the story?!&#8221; another added. &#8220;The art department hates my goat Adler for some reason this time around,&#8221; commented another.&#160;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Further players also asked, &#8220;When we getting a regular Adler skin?&#8221; and suggested that &#8220;Adler is not respected&#8221; at the moment.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The character, who has been integral to the Black Ops storyline, has a new look on display in the Season 3 outro cinematic trailer. They&#8217;re desperate to get their hands on that one, if possible, so it might be something for Treyarch to consider.</p>
