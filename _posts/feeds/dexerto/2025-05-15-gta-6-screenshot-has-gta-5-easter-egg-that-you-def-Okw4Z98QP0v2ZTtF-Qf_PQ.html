<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Grand Theft Auto fans have spotted a GTA 5 Easter Egg in a GTA 6 screenshot, and it could have big implications for a popular character.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 2, Rockstar Games delivered a blow to Grand Theft Auto fans as they confirmed that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-officially-delayed-until-2026-3189190/">GTA 6 would actually be delayed</a> until May 26, 2026.<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/leaker-proven-correct-about-gta-6-reveals-more-about-the-games-development-3194398/"> The delay, according to insiders, was &#8220;absolutely needed,&#8221;</a> and the game would have been &#8220;significantly worse&#8221; without it.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Despite the delay, the Grand Theft Auto developers have <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-trailer-2-finally-reveals-more-story-details-3190524/">released a second trailer</a>, dropped a ton of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/all-confirmed-gta-6-characters-3190548/">information about the characters</a>, and also revealed almost 100 screenshots.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fans have been poring through the screenshots, trying to find additional clues about the game. That has included some believing they&#8217;ve spotted, for the first time, a child in a Grand Theft Auto title. However, another Easter Egg has been uncovered, and it relates to one of GTA 5&#8217;s most popular characters &#8211; Michael.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-5-fans-spot-michael&#8217;s-movie-in-gta-6-screenshot" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">GTA 5 fans spot Michael&#8217;s movie in GTA 6 screenshot</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In one of the new screenshots, eagle-eyed fans have spotted a DVD of Michael&#8217;s movie, Meltdown, being displayed on a shelf in the new game.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Redditor Merstty noted that the nod to the old game is hard to spot because it is a part of an animation on the Rockstar website. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t visible on the website version, so you have to download it from the downloads tab to check,&#8221; they said.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Michael&#8217;s big goal after getting out of the heist game was, of course, to become a movie producer and Meltdown was his first big shoot. &#8220;I hope Michael makes an appearance as a Strangers and Freaks mission,&#8221; one fan <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1kmu1g6/michaels_movie_meltdown_in_the_gta6_website_images/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link">said</a>. &#8220;By the time the game comes out, Michael will have been a producer for 13 years, I think,&#8221; another added.</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, given that you have the option to kill him at the end of GTA 5, it could create some canon issues for fans.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Others noted that Michael popping up in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/gta-6/">GTA 6 </a>is unlikely, given that Ned Luke, the actor behind him, has said he hasn&#8217;t worked on the new game.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We know Michael isn&#8217;t in GTA 6 because Ned Luke X&#8217;s and streams constantly. We know where he is and what he&#8217;s doing for most of each week, so he has no time to slip away to Rockstar&#8217;s studio and film,&#8221; one added.&#160;</p>
