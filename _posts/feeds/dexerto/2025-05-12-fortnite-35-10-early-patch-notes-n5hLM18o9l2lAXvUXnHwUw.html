<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fortnite&#8217;s 35.10 update is set to introduce new weapons as well as other exciting additions in Chapter 6, Season 3.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fortnite&#8217;s Chapter 6, Season 3 may <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/when-does-this-fortnite-season-end-3165257/">not be long</a> compared to the previous ones, but it&#8217;s packed with a plethora of new content to keep players busy. In this current Galactic Battle season, the game is confirmed to receive <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/full-star-wars-update-schedule-in-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-3186591/">six major updates</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With a season dedicated to Star Wars, we&#8217;ve seen the entire loot pool be replaced with blasters, as well as old skins from the franchise returning to the shop. That&#8217;s not all there is to it, though.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The upcoming 35.10 update is shaping up to be huge, as fan-favorite characters will finally make their debut along with new weapons. Below, we&#8217;ve gathered everything you need to know that will be coming in the next patch.</p>



 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The v35.10 update, also referred to as &#8220;Chew on This,&#8221; is set to release on <strong>May 15, 2025</strong>. This has been confirmed by Epic via their <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/strap-in-starfighter-star-wars-is-taking-over-in-fortnite-galactic-battle">blog post</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Though the exact time isn&#8217;t confirmed yet, looking at previous updates, it will likely drop at 1:00 AM PDT / 4:00 AM EDT / 9:00 AM GMT.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Players can expect matchmaking to end shortly for maintenance before the update goes live and the servers are online. This usually lasts a few hours, but on rare occasions, it can take longer.</p>



<h2 id="h-wookie-bowcaster-&amp;-ca-87-jawa-scatter-blaster-weapons" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Wookie Bowcaster &amp; CA-87 Jawa Scatter Blaster weapons</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This update will bring two weapons to the loot pool, the first one being the returning <strong>Wookie Bowcaster</strong>, which was first added in Chapter 5, Season 2. This is a projectile weapon that deals a lot of damage the longer you charge it. Though it can also be fired normally.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On the other hand, the second weapon will be the all-new <strong>CA-87 Jawa Scatter Blaster</strong>. Not much is known about this weapon just yet, but assuming it works the same way in the franchise, it&#8217;s likely that it&#8217;s a deadly weapon in close-quarter fights.</p> 



<h2 id="h-general-grievous-skin-quests-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">General Grievous Skin quests&#160;</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">During this update, the &#8220;Grevious Rewards&#8221; tab of the Battle Pass will finally be unlocked. As usual, expect to see new quests added as a way to earn rewards from this tab, which includes the General Grievous skin and additional cosmetics.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Aside from that, it&#8217;s likely that the super styles for this season will also be revealed and unlocked once this update drops as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-possible-death-jar-jar-skin" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Possible Death Jar Jar skin</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/FortniteFNLK/status/1921645163262120379">leaked information</a>, this update may also introduce the Death Jar Jar skin that was previously featured in the season&#8217;s cinematics. Just like in the trailer, this skin has him wearing a long black hoodie and cape.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That&#8217;s everything we know so far about the 35.10 update. On top of all these, there&#8217;s also a chance that there&#8217;ll be some map changes and we&#8217;ll keep you updated once more information emerges.</p>
