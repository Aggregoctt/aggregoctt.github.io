<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After weeks of rumors, it&#8217;s now been confirmed that Alex Garland will tackle an Elden Ring adaptation, bringing From Software&#8217;s most popular game to the big screen.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While earlier FromSoft titles like Dark Souls and Bloodborne certainly did well, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/elden-ring/">Elden Ring</a> was a smash hit beyond compare. It quickly became <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/elden-ring/how-many-copies-has-elden-ring-sold-2142874/">one of the best-selling games ever</a>, with millions of players venturing through the Lands Between.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s proven so popular, in fact, we&#8217;re now getting a feature film out of it. Having <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/elden-ring/fromsoftware-president-opens-the-door-for-elden-ring-movie-on-one-condition-2798492/">always been onboard with the idea of an adaptation</a>, the Japanese game devs have now given the green light for A24 to turn Elden Ring into a movie.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Not only that, but acclaimed writer and director Alex Garland is attached. While known best for the likes of 28 Days Later, Ex Machina, and most recently, Civil War and Warfare, Garland has long been a vocal supporter of the gaming industry. Now, he&#8217;s set to adapt one of the biggest games in recent history.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/elden-ring-movie-may-get-made-without-george-r-r-martin-but-theres-a-good-reason-3140057/">rumors began to circulate</a> earlier in the year, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-directing-a24-movie-1236408999/">A24 confirmed its plans</a> to make an Elden Ring movie on May 22, 2025. Garland is set to both write and direct the live-action film, translating the source material originally created by FromSoft, with help from Game of Thrones creator George R. R. Martin.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Martin created the foundation for which the story of Elden Ring was built upon, laying the groundwork with history of the realm, its characters, and more. Seemingly eager to do anything but finish his series of novels, Martin himself is also attached in a producing role for the Elden Ring film.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Given it&#8217;s still early days, there&#8217;s no quite telling just how the live-action film may look. Elden Ring, much like all other Soulslikes, features otherworldly monsters and larger-than-life bosses while leaving much of its lore to loose descriptions for players to piece together.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s also no telling if it will be a direct adaptation of the game&#8217;s storyline, or whether Garland will pen a new story in the mega-popular universe. Only time will tell and we&#8217;ll be sure to keep you posted as further details emerge.</p>
