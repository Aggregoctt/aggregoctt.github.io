<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In April 2024, Twitch introduced a tool familiar to TikTok users &#8212; a &#8216;Discovery Feed,&#8217; which serves up a blend of both personalized content and recommendations based on one&#8217;s search and watch history.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/">Twitch</a> touted this feed as &#8220;the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/discovery-feed?language=en_US">quickest way to find content</a> you love&#8221; on its platform&#8230; but a year later, broadcasters say this isn&#8217;t actually helping them get discovered.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Similar to TikTok, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/what-is-twitchs-new-discovery-feed-how-to-use-new-features-more-2672039/">Twitch&#8217;s Discovery Feed</a> provides a never-ending list of broadcasts, clips and communities that viewers can scroll through to find more of what they&#8217;re interested in, potentially allowing them to come across new streamers they haven&#8217;t yet watched in the process.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Twitch&#8217;s chief monetization officer, Mike Minton, stated that over half of Twitch&#8217;s video views from new viewers &#8212; along with 38 million new followers &#8212; are coming as a direct result of the Discovery Feed.</p>



<h2 id="h-twitch-streamers-say-discovery-feed-isn&#8217;t-helping-channel-growth" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Twitch streamers say Discovery Feed isn&#8217;t helping channel growth</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Twitch streamers claim they aren&#8217;t seeing any change as a result of Twitch&#8217;s discover feed changes, saying that Twitch is behind the curve when it comes to all these new features. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In statements to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://digiday.com/media/twitchs-discovery-fee-isnt-delivering-creators-say/">Digiday</a>, three content creators spoke out about their experiences with growth after the Discovery Feed was implemented, or the lack thereof.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;For newer users, they already have TikTok / YouTube Shorts / Instagram Reels, so why would they ever want to watch poorly formatted vertical clips or boxed horizontal clips through Twitch when their current apps do it better?&#8221; said <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.twitch.tv/gappyv">GappyV</a>, a gaming variety streamer with over 13K followers.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One half of streaming duo <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.twitch.tv/hangtime">HangTime</a> had similar sentiments. &#8220;With all due respect to new creators, Twitch is and should only be considered a home base. Your channel will not grow.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Whether you&#8217;ve been featured on the front page for a year straight (as I have), whether you make the biggest, most flamboyant content ever (as I have) &#8212; if that content is not blowing up on YouTube or TikTok&#8230; you will not grow on Twitch.&#8221;</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In response to these concerns, Minton told Digiday that Twitch is aware of the drawbacks to its vertical feed as opposed to other platform, saying that &#8220;we recognize one of the biggest impediments to a really good feed experience is that most of our video is horizontal 16:9 [ratio].&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That&#8217;s not all; Minton also revealed that Twitch has plans to offer vertical live streaming in &#8220;a couple months&#8221; as a further improvement to the experience.</p>
