Microsoft President Brad Smith has now addressed the decision publicly, calling it &#8220;common sense.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Back on January 2022, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/micrsoft-activision-takeover-1875225/">Microsoft finalized its deal the purchase Activision Blizzard</a> for a whopping $68.7 billion, making it the most expensive video game-related acquisition in to date. However, shortly after making the deal, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) attempted to block the merger, arguing that it would be a threat to competition in gaming, specifically in first-party titles and subscription services.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">What followed was a three-year battle between Microsoft and the FTC. Initially, the motion was denied by the Court of Appeals, to which the FTC submitted a preliminary injunction (a motion that forced Microsoft to hold off on the purchase). This was also denied in July 2023. The FTC vowed to keep trying, until on May 7, 2025, it was forced to drop the case.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While it was dropped on May 7, it wasn&#8217;t until May 22 that Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith spoke out on the case <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://x.com/BradSmi/status/1925660906702156072">on X.</a></p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Today&#8217;s decision is a victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, D.C. We are grateful to the FTC for today&#8217;s announcement,&#8221; shared Brad Smith.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The subsequent document highlighting the case being dismissed was also shared, revealing that the United States District Court would be &#8220;denying the Commission&#8217;s application for a preliminary injunction to block the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. by Microsoft Corp.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">They continued: &#8220;The Commission has determined that the public interest is best served by dismissing the administrative litigation in this case,&#8221; meaning the entire case has officially been dismissed.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This will mean that Microsoft can officially purchase Activision Blizzard after three years of waiting. However, what this will mean for new games and those previously controlled by Activision Blizzard is yet to be revealed, though the original intention for this purchase was to gain control over the company&#8217;s mobile games.</p>
