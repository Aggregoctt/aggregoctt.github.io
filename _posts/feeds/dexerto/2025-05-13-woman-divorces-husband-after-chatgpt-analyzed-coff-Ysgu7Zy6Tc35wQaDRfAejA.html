<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Welp, we have AIs ending marriages before <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/gta-6/">GTA 6</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A marriage of 12 years is coming to an end after a couple decided it would be fun to have <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/what-is-chatgpt-ai-chat-2005980/">ChatGPT</a> &#8220;read&#8221; their Greek coffees and interpret the coffee grounds in the cups.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/04/26/greek-woman-files-for-divorce-after-chatgpt-reads-husbands-affair-in-coffee-cup/">Greek City Times</a>, instead of getting a fun quip from the AI, the man&#8217;s cup claimed that he had been fantasizing about a woman with the initial &#8216;E&#8217; and was destined to begin a relationship with her.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Meanwhile, ChatGPT analyzed her cup and claimed that her husband was already cheating with this mystery woman who wanted to destroy their home.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Originally, the man laughed off ChatGPT&#8217;s analysis, but his wife had her heart broken.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;She took it seriously. She asked me to leave, told our kids we were getting divorced, and then I got a call from a lawyer. That&#8217;s when I realized this wasn&#8217;t just a phase,&#8221; the man told Greek morning show To Proino.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After not agreeing to a mutual separation, his wife served him with divorce papers three days later.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The husband, however, maintains his innocence with his lawyer adding that the AI chatbot has no legal standing.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;A few years ago, she visited an astrologer and it took a whole year for her to accept that none of it was real,&#8221; he added, recalling that his wife has a history when it comes to supernatural beliefs and is &#8220; often into trendy things.&#8221;</p>
