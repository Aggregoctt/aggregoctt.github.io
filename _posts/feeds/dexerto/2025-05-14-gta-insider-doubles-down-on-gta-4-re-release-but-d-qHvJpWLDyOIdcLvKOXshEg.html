<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s reportedly a new version of GTA 4 in the works at Rockstar, however, a prominent insider has shared new details, revealing why we shouldn&#8217;t set our expectations too high.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the span of 11 years, Rockstar released six mainline entries in the GTA franchise, spanning the original through to GTA 4. Since then, the industry has shifted and it&#8217;s now been 12 years since GTA 5 hit store shelves. The wait for the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-officially-delayed-until-2026-3189190/">recently delayed</a> <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/gta-6/">GTA 6</a> has been excruciating to say the least.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the interim, fans have been clamoring for new updates to the old classics, though it hasn&#8217;t exactly gone to plan. The GTA Definitive Edition Trilogy in 2021 was labeled a &#8220;<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/opinion/gta-trilogy-a-definitive-failure-for-rockstar-games-1699397/">definitive failure</a>&#8221; for its many shortcomings. Meanwhile, Red Dead Redemption 2 fans are still waiting for a current-gen port.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s been a rough stretch but when prominent <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-insider-claims-rockstar-is-set-to-release-gta-4-remaster-for-new-consoles-3194365/">Rockstar insider TezFun claimed a new version of GTA 4 was in the works</a>, thousands of avid fans were quick to express their joy.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 11, the leaker addressed a comment on the GTAForums asking whether a GTA 4 &#8220;remaster/port for modern consoles is happening.&#8221; Now, however, new details have surfaced suggesting fans shouldn&#8217;t be getting themselves too excited.</p>


 


<h2 id="h-gta-4-re-release-reportedly-not-a-full-remaster" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">GTA 4 re-release reportedly not a full remaster</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the original comment, TeZ <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1001944-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2/page/90/#comment-1072547918">claimed</a> &#8220;someone at Rockstar hinted at the GTA 4 port. By now, it should&#8217;ve gone up a year in development.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The leaker even suggested &#8220;we may end up seeing it drop later this year.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While explicitly stating he heard of a &#8220;port,&#8221; not a &#8220;remaster,&#8221; the community certainly got excited of the possibility nonetheless. Seeing the 2008 title running on modern hardware is, of course, an exciting prospect.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Though rather than a full-fledged remaster helping boost the game&#8217;s performance or improve visual fidelity, TeZ has now doubled down on his comments. According to the insider, the project is very much a port through and through, with no meaningful upgrades confirmed.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It&#8217;s not a remaster,&#8221; the leaker said in a May 14 follow-up. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know which platforms are targeted, or which version it will be based off, or which studio is handling this port. All I know is that it entered development last year.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Clearly, details are scarce, and the leaker even suggested fans take his words with a grain of salt. For all we know, the port could be the bare minimum, simply making the classic title playable on current hardware, like the 2023 port of Red Dead Redemption on console.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Or it could arrive with a few slight tweaks, like we saw with 2024&#8217;s Red Dead Redemtpion port on PC. Confusing, we know.</p>
