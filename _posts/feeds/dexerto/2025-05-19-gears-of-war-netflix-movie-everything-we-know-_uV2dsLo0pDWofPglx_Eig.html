<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A live-action Gears of War movie has been discussed for decades but now, the cogs are finally turning. Netflix is moving ahead with a feature film and we&#8217;ve got the full rundown on the very first details.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s hard to believe 19 years have passed since <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gears-of-war/">Gears of War</a> first made an impact on the Xbox 360. All these years later, the franchise is still among Microsoft&#8217;s most popular, to the point that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gears-of-war/gears-of-war-is-getting-a-remake-and-its-coming-to-playstation-5-3190112/">a PlayStation port is now arriving in 2025</a>. Who would have thought?</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While we&#8217;ve seen a litany of sequels and spinoffs over the years, the original that kickstarted it all is still hailed as one of the most iconic third-person shooters ever. With its snappy cover-to-cover combat, over-the-top lancer violence, and surprisingly moving storyline, the game has remained a fan favorite.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now, it&#8217;s set to make a splash in an entirely new medium. After years of false starts, a Gears of War movie is officially going ahead at Netflix. Here&#8217;s everything we know thus far.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">No, it&#8217;s far too early for there to be a release date. The Gears of War movie hasn&#8217;t yet started shooting, and given the no doubt extensive post-production work down the line, it&#8217;s likely a few years off at the very least.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;d wager Netflix won&#8217;t have the Gears of War movie finished until late 2027 at the absolute earliest. Rest assured, we&#8217;ll update you here as timetables fall into place and production gets underway.</p>  



 



<h2 id="h-who&#8217;s-involved-with-the-gears-of-war-movie-at-netflix?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Who&#8217;s involved with the Gears of War movie at Netflix?</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gears-of-war-movie-david-leitch-director-1236212544/">The Hollywood Reporter first noted</a>, David Leitch is in talks to direct the live-action Gears of War movie. While Leitch is largely known for his stunt work, he&#8217;s come into his own as a director too, having helmed the likes of Deadpool 2, Bullet Train, and The Fall Guy. He&#8217;s also a producer on the John Wick series.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Meanwhile, Jon Spaihts is reportedly set to pen the script, after finishing his work on Dennis Villeneuve&#8217;s Dune trilogy. He also has earlier credits for Doctor Strange, Prometheus, and many others.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As for who may appear in front of the camera, nothing has yet been confirmed. The original Gears of War game focuses on Marcus Fenix and his squadmates. They&#8217;re all physical behemoths, so expect to see some muscular actors cast for these roles.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Obviously Fenix is the most important as the story&#8217;s protagonist, but there&#8217;s no looking past Cole, Baird, and the ever-loyal Dominic Santiago. We&#8217;ll just have to wait and see who gets picked for these iconic roles.</p> 



<h2 id="h-is-dave-bautista-in-the-gears-of-war-movie?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Is Dave Bautista in the Gears of War movie?</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Championing the franchise perhaps more than anyone has been ex-WWE superstar turned actor Dave Bautista. From his early days on screen, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/dave-bautista-needs-your-help-to-get-gears-of-war-movie-made-3141957/">Bautista has been begging for a chance to portray Marcus Fenix</a> on the big screen.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Although he&#8217;s been shouting from the rooftops for well over a decade at this point, and even appeared in Gears 5, there&#8217;s no guarantee his wish will come true.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At the time of writing, Bautista is 56 years old. Should Netflix have hopes of turning this into a series of films, he may have unfortunately missed the window to take the lead role.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Regardless, we&#8217;re rooting for Netflix to do the right thing and give him a spot in the movie at the very least.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-will-the-gears-of-war-movie-be-about?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">What will the Gears of War movie be about?</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The idea of the Netflix adaptation is to cover the events of the first game. While details are light for the time being, we don&#8217;t expect core changes to the narrative. Rather, it&#8217;s set to be a faithful recreation of the opening act of the series.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This means we&#8217;ll be dropped right into the midst of the Locust war on Sera. In particular, we&#8217;ll be following Marcus Fenix and his squad as they fight back against the forces of General RAAM.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If succesful, Netflix is reportedly hoping to spin Gears of War off in other ways, including with an <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1589695430404677632">adult-oriented animated show</a>, much like Castelvania or Devil May Cry.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For now, that&#8217;s everything we know about the live-action Gears of War film. It&#8217;s still early days yet but rest assured we&#8217;ll be updating you here with all the latest details as they emerge.</p>
