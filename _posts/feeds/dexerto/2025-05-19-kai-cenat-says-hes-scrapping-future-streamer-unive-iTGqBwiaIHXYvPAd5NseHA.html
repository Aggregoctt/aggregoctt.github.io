<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Kai Cenat has scrapped his plans to do another Streamer University after the first one amid hate from some creators.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over the last few years, Kai Cenat has helped a number of content creators grow into stars on Twitch. The AMP member regularly collabs with the likes of IShowSpeed, Fanum, and Ray on different projects.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At the end of February, h<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/kai-cenat-has-massive-university-plan-to-help-twitch-streamers-with-mrbeast-involved-3131895/">e revealed that he&#8217;d be starting up a Streamer University</a>, aimed at helping some other creators. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/kai-cenat-finally-launches-streamer-university-everyone-wants-in-3190825/">Kai has a college on board so he can use their campus</a>, has bought a ton of streaming equipment, and has other big-name streamers on board to help teach classes.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, he has had some backlash for some of the creators he&#8217;s selected to attend the classes. That, he says, has seen him scrap plans to do it again.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-streamer-university-may-not-return" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Streamer University may not return</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This is an idea, and I know how exciting it may be to certain people, but it&#8217;s like bro, you don&#8217;t have to let this determine who you are as a creator,&#8221; <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.twitch.tv/kaicenat/videos">he</a> said.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I&#8217;m never doing this f**king s*it again. No matter which direction I go, no matter which way I try to make sure things is good, I always get the bad end of the stick. My bank statements is f**king ridiculous behind this s*it. Nobody is paying a dime to be in this s*it.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Twitch star added the project is just for him to &#8220;help&#8221; other creators, but he has still received hate for it.&#160;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As noted, Kai has revealed a number of the creators who are going to be involved. The likes of DDG, Duke Dennis, Extra Emily, and Dontai are playing roles as professors.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There are 150 streamers attending as students, and should all see some massive growth some things get underway. Though, they may just be the only class to ever pass through the Streamer University doors.</p>
