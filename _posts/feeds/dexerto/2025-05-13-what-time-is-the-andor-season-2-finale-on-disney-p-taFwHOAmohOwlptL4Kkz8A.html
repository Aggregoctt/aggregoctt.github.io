<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you&#8217;ve recovered from The Ghorman Massacre and Mon Mothma&#8217;s tense escape from the Senate, you&#8217;ll want to know when the next episode arrives, so here&#8217;s exactly when you can watch <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/andor/">Andor</a> Episodes 10, 11, and 12. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Empire&#8217;s plans for Ghorman came to fruition in Episode 8, giving Mon Mothma the ammunition she needed to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/mon-mothma-andor-season-2-speech-explained-3191116/">publicly call out Empire Palpatine</a>, before finally meeting Cassian. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s what the entire season has been leading to, so I wouldn&#8217;t blame you for thinking it was the finale, but there are three more episodes to go. </p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Andor Season 2 Episodes 10-12, which include the finale, drop on <strong>Tuesday, May 13, at 6pm PT / 9pm ET</strong>&#160;on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/disney/">Disney Plus</a>. If you&#8217;re outside the US, you won&#8217;t be able to see the finale until Wednesday, May 14. </p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Episodes 10-12 are set in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/star-wars-timeline-in-order-2676630/">0 BBY</a>, the same year as Rogue One and A New Hope. All we really know is that it ends with Cassian heading to the Ring of Kafrene, where we meet him in Rogue One. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, we know where Cassian&#8217;s going, but we&#8217;re yet to find out what happens to Andor&#8217;s big players, such as Dedra, Luthen, Kleya, Lonnie, and Vel.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The trailer showed some scenes we&#8217;re yet to see, like Dedra pointing a blaster, Krennec overseeing the Death Star&#8217;s construction, and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/andor-season-2-k2so-shocking-introduction-contradicts-canon-3192427/">K-2SO</a> ragdolling an Imperial soldier, but what actually happens is anyone&#8217;s guess. </p> 



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-an-andor-s2-episode-13?-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Will there be an Andor S2 Episode 13? </h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">No, <strong>Andor Season 2 Episode 12 is the final episode</strong>, and there won&#8217;t be a Season 3 either. </p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Although it was originally going to run for five seasons, showrunner Tony Gilroy realized it would take too long to make, so Season 2 covered four years instead. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-watch-after-andor-season-2" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">What to watch after Andor Season 2</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>Rogue One</strong> is the only choice if you&#8217;re looking for a direct sequel to Andor, as it picks up almost immediately after the show ends and continues the story. Also written by Tony Gilroy, it&#8217;s where Cassian was first introduced, and it wraps up the story for a handful of the show&#8217;s characters. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s also <strong>Star Wars Rebels</strong> (hear me out). Sure, it&#8217;s made for kids and couldn&#8217;t be further from Andor in tone, but it has some incredible moments, shows more of the Rebellion, and, most importantly, one of the episodes continues Mon Mothma&#8217;s story after Episode 9. </p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After Cassian rescues Mon from the Senate, he&#8217;s told &#8220;they want to rewrite the story&#8221; by having her give a speech and arrive with a Yavin escort. Season 3 Episode 18 of Rebels shows what happens here, starting with the Ghost Crew listening to her denounce Palpatine following the Ghorman Massacre, then helping her escape the Empire, before she makes the speech Erskin mentions (he&#8217;s also in this episode). </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Genevieve O&#8217;Reilly plays Mon Mothma in this episode, too, and while it is a kids&#8217; show, it&#8217;s a nice palate cleanser after Andor&#8217;s emotional devastation. </p>
