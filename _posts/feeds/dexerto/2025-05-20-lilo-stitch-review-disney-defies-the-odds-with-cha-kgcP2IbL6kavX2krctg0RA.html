<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/lilo-stitch-disney-cast-plot-and-everything-about-remake-2114257/">Lilo and Stitch</a> is emphatically inferior to Disney&#8217;s classic predecessor; drab visuals, lesser performances, and nearly entirely redundant. And yet, thanks to its titular, mischievous mascot, it works so much that you forget all of its flaws.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In 2010, Alice in Wonderland &#8211; an interminable, bombastic blur &#8211; <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/top-50-highest-grossing-movies-of-all-time-1856841/">made over $1 billion</a>, a harbinger of despair for Disney&#8217;s rollout of do-overs. They keep making them for the same reason that dealers will always sell drugs: people keep handing over their money.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">And yet, when they don&#8217;t feel like glorified tech demos designed to print cash, they justify themselves; Pete&#8217;s Dragon stands completely apart from the original and is a much better film, Cinderella is stunning, and Cruella is a punky, amusingly nasty spin on the 101 Dalmatians heiress. The rest border on depressing, playing (and preying) on the studio&#8217;s beloved history.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Lilo and Stitch is somewhere in the middle: a remake that will make you smile so much that you almost forget how needless it is&#8230; almost.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-what-is-lilo-and-stitch-about?-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">What is Lilo and Stitch about?&#160;</h2>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Lilo (Maia Kealoha), a young, trouble-making orphan in Hawaii, struggles to make friends; they think she&#8217;s weird, and her parents say she&#8217;s a &#8220;bad kid.&#8221; Meanwhile, her older sister Nani (Sydney Elizebeth Agudong) tries to make ends meet and fend off the concerns of a social worker (Tia Carrere).&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One night, Lilo &#8220;wishes upon a star for a best friend&#8221; &#8211;&#160;and her wish is granted, with a catch: she encounters Experiment 626, a feisty, blue alien that destroys everything with gleeful abandon.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">They find kinship in chaos, to the point he earns the name Stitch, but there are two problems: firstly, he&#8217;s strictly the property of the United Galactic Federation, which sends Dr Jumba Jookiba (Zach Galifianakis) and Agent Pleakley (Billy Magnussen) to retrieve him; and two, his crash-landing on Earth attracts the attention of Cobra Bubbles, a no-nonsense federal agent.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-lilo-and-stitch-is-different&#8230;-but-the-same" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Lilo and Stitch is different&#8230; but the same</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">You may have noticed one absence: Captain Gantu, arguably the main villain of the original film. He&#8217;s completely cut from the remake, with the script (penned by Chris Kekaniokalani Bright and Mike Van Waes) focusing more on Jumba and Pleakley&#8217;s efforts to catch Stitch and slightly retooling Cobra&#8217;s role and how his involvement unfolds.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That seems like a big change, and it is&#8230; on paper. The remake juggles its characters and pitches its pacing so well that you probably won&#8217;t notice Gantu is missing &#8211; plus, for the most part, the story remains intact (with an added, sweet mid-credits scene you should stick around for).&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But here&#8217;s the thing: the original movie isn&#8217;t just great, it&#8217;s magical, a genuine masterpiece of Disney&#8217;s post-millennium library. A live-action remake with this little verve was never going to top it, so it doesn&#8217;t try &#8211; it plays the hits (and us, the viewers, like steel guitars and drums), and that includes a couple of Elvis tracks.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For example, the &#8216;Hawaiian Rollercoaster Ride&#8217; scene left tears in my eyes (every memory of watching Lilo and Stitch rushed back, and it belongs in the highest echelon of Disney songs)&#160; &#8211; but is that nostalgia, or did the film actually earn that response? It&#8217;s definitely the former, as the remake&#8217;s version is fundamentally worse (the updated inclusion of the Kamehameha Schools Children&#8217;s Chorus is a nice touch). But did I care enough in the moment to recognize the difference? No. I sat back, bobbed my head, and let myself well up.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-you-will-fall-in-love-with-stitch-again" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">You will fall in love with Stitch again</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After the remake, Stitch should be added to Disney&#8217;s Mount Rushmore. To borrow Elvis&#8217; words, you can&#8217;t help falling in love with him &#8211; a gnashing, smashing, fuzzy extraterrestrial mongrel that makes the whole thing feel worthwhile.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The VFX team has done an extraordinary job, and credit to director Dean Fleischer Camp; if you&#8217;ve watched Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, you&#8217;ll know he was the right choice to bring him into the real world in a way that feels tangible and every bit as sweet and lovable.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Whenever Stitch isn&#8217;t on screen, the movie&#8217;s mileage varies. Agudong and Kealoha are a likable pairing, and Magnussen delivers hilarious physical comedy, but it&#8217;d be disingenuous to say anyone in the cast is especially memorable; they&#8217;re all exactly what the film needs them to be &#8211; fine, with the capacity for good.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The way it looks is hard to forgive, considering its source material used watercolor-painted backgrounds to give it that dreamy, one-of-a-kind warmth. It&#8217;s one of the most beautiful Disney movies ever, and its remake is shot with the flair of an advert for a budget package holiday company and uninspiringly lit. You&#8217;d never know that it&#8217;s meant to take place in paradise.</p> 



<h2 id="h-lilo-and-stitch-review-score:-3/5-&#8211;-good" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Lilo and Stitch review score: 3/5 &#8211; Good</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Lilo and Stitch is easily one of Disney&#8217;s most (if not the most) enjoyable live-action remakes. It isn&#8217;t as enchanting as the original, but once you look past its weakness and coast with its motion, it&#8217;s hard to resist.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the moment, as Stitch wreaks cackling havoc, there&#8217;s no place you&#8217;d rather be; lingering, laughing, and tearing up in the ocean blue.&#160;</p>
