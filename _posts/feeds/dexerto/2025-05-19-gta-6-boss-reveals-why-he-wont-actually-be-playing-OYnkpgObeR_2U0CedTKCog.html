<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has cleared things up about a potential second delay to Grand Theft Auto 6&#8217;s release date, and also revealed that he won&#8217;t actually play the game.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At the start of May, Rockstar Games delivered the news that Grand Theft Auto fans had been fearing for a while, confirming that<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-rumors-story-and-more-for-the-next-grand-theft-auto-game-245713/"> GTA 6</a> would be delayed another six months until May 26, 2026.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/leaker-proven-correct-about-gta-6-reveals-more-about-the-games-development-3194398/">The delay, according to leakers, is &#8220;absolutely necessary,&#8221; </a>and the game would be &#8220;significantly worse&#8221; without the extra time. &#8220;They began cutting a lot of cool stuff to try and make that deadline,&#8221; GameRoll said on X (Formerly Twitter).</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Part of that was <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/take-two-ceo-reveals-why-rockstar-needed-to-delay-gta-6-3196327/">backed up by Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick during their May 16 earnings call</a>. &#8220;As we get closer to completion of a title that&#8217;s seeking perfection, the needs or lack thereof, for continued polish become clear,&#8221; he said.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-boss-not-worried-about-a-second-delay" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">GTA 6 boss not worried about a second delay</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to Zelnick, despite rumors of a second delay, he isn&#8217;t all that worried. &#8220;I think historically when we set a specific date, generally speaking, we&#8217;ve been very good about reaching it,&#8221; he said.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, despite having the chance to play it before anyone else, the Take-Two boss isn&#8217;t going to pick up a controller and make a start.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I&#8217;m not a gamer, not a lot &#8211; I don&#8217;t play video games, I&#8217;m not the consumer-in-chief,&#8221; he told <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://youtu.be/oBlLUo11qWg?si=rRcDnfFcIMuPXFzv">CNBC</a>. &#8220;I think being the consumer-in-chief in the entertainment business as the CEO is probably a mistake.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Zelnick noted that he shares &#8220;opinions pretty openly&#8221; with developers but he isn&#8217;t one to dabble in storylines or features. That&#8217;s just not his bag.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;My role is to attract, retain, and motivate the best talent in the business, and then getting out of their way,&#8221; he added.&#160;</p>
