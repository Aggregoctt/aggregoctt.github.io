<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Met Gala is one of the biggest nights of the year for the fashion and arts world, with tonnes of celebrities descending on New York to stunt on the red carpet. Outsiders aren&#8217;t shy about giving their opinions either.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">During the 2025 Met Gala, Doechii, who has become incredibly popular on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tiktok/">TikTok</a> and social media for her song &#8216;Anxiety&#8217;, had assistants cover her with umbrellas so she couldn&#8217;t be seen during a wardrobe change.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The moment split opinion online, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/kick/adin-ross-slams-doechii-over-viral-met-gala-umbrella-incident-3195058/">with Adin Ross chiming in to hit out at the artist. </a>&#8220;What an entitled, unintelligent, piece of sh*t she is, bro. I&#8217;m not joking, bro, stop listening to her music. &#8230;She&#8217;s just the worst,&#8221; he said.&#160;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">His furious review of the moment quickly went viral too, with many questioning why Ross had been so forceful in his criticism. Now, he has revealed that he&#8217;s lost out on money because of it.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;You know what&#8217;s crazy&#8230; oh my God, I&#8217;m so mad Ak. My PR was finally getting better. I had two deals lined up, but I lost both my deals. On God,&#8221; <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/adin-ross/">Adin</a> told DJ Akademiks during his May 14 stream.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;They f**ked up my s*it. I had an ad deal too, I was going to do. Bro, I&#8217;m mad as f**k Ak. It&#8217;s not even about the money, it&#8217;s because I wanted to do it. It was a bag, it was a big deal.&#8221;</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Some fans quickly assumed that it was a clothing deal as Adin made reference to Nocta, Drake&#8217;s collaborative brand with Nike, being the only one who would work with him.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Shout out to Nocta. We on the Nocta, the only brand I can wear, and get to f**k with me right now,&#8221; he said during his Brand Risk press conference.</p>
