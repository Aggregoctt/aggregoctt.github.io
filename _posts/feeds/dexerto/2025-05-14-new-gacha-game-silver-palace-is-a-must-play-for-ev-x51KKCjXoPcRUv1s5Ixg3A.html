<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/silver-palace-pre-registration-gameplay-characters-3194784/">Silver Palace</a> is the latest gacha game that is vying for your attention, and here&#8217;s why it needs to be on your radar.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Since its May 13 reveal, Silver Palace has caused quite a stir within the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/best-upcoming-gacha-games-3009756/">gacha game</a> community, and for good reason. Not only does its Victorian-inspired open world look stunning (seriously, watch the trailer), but its sleek character-driven combat aims to give <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/genshin-impact/">Genshin Impact</a> and Wuthering Waves a run for their money.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While Silver Palace doesn&#8217;t have a release date yet, the early gameplay looks incredibly ambitious. So, here&#8217;s exactly why you need to add Silver Palace to your wishlist, even if you&#8217;re not a gacha game fan.</p>



<h2 id="h-sleek-&amp;-stylish-combat" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Sleek &amp; stylish combat</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Taking down enemies while dressed to the nines in a tailored suit will never not be cool. Just ask Agent 47 and James Bond &#8211; they&#8217;re never afraid to kill in style. Silver Palace&#8217;s character designs aren&#8217;t to be scoffed at either, as the main characters have somehow managed to make fedoras cool again (it&#8217;s a crime what that meme did).</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">And, Silver Palace&#8217;s anime characters don&#8217;t just slay on the catwalk, they also have some incredibly stylish combat abilities. While Silver Palace features four party characters, like Genshin Impact, the gameplay is comparable to Sekiro, with players needing to deplete an enemy&#8217;s posture bar by both blocking and attacking.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Once the bar has been completely depleted, you&#8217;ll be able to rush in for a devastating attack or a fatal ultimate finisher. And boy, do these moves look brutal. During the 10-minute gameplay reveal, we saw everything from explosive neck injections to AoE sword slams that pummel enemies into the ground.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There appears to be a real weight to combat as well, with enemies being knocked back and flinching from impactful hits. It&#8217;s not just in your face combat scenarios either. Stealth sections also appear to be present, with the player sneaking down a dimly lit alleyway before delivering a neck-breaking takedown.</p> 



<h2 id="h-gorgeous-open-world-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Gorgeous open world&#160;</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">From trams that lazily slink their way through the city streets to the cafes and bars nestled amongst old brick buildings, Silvernia city wears its Victorian-inspired aesthetic proudly upon its sleeve.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One of my biggest gripes with gacha games is that while the environments may look pretty, they often feel devoid of life. Genshin Impact famously overcame this by populating their environments with NPCs, but they often feel like nothing more than glorified set dressing.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Silvernia&#8217;s cobbled roads are filled with people going about their day; they walk through the streets, they drink in bars, and they drive stylish cars. Hell, one scene even showed how the player can enter a bar and question people, which in turn, helped them track down a dangerous enemy.</p> 



<h2 id="h-fun-traversal-mechanics-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Fun traversal mechanics&#160;</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Mechanized horse. Need I say more? Yes, Silver Palace features a rather dashing horse that you can summon. Why run or fast travel to your next destination when you can gallop through the streets in style?</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The devs, in all their wisdom, have also given your quadrupedal companion the ability to drift Need for Speed style. Watching a horse effortlessly drift around narrow street corners wasn&#8217;t on my gacha bingo card, but it is now something I desperately need more of.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Silver Palace also does away with gliders &#8211; something that has been present in most open-world games, ever since Breath of the Wild made it cool to do so. Instead, your horse happens to come with a handy pair of wings.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">During the gameplay video, we got to see how the main character effortlessly flies between buildings and above rooftops. The winged beast can also effortlessly transition from ground to aerial traversal. Sorry, Epona, Link really should be taking notes.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While Silver Palaces&#8217; equestrian traversal takes center stage, there&#8217;s a nifty grappling hook that speeds up rooftop travel. The <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://youtu.be/EIUa74hDJiQ?si=ZZMVBj5j6PvrdXBH&amp;t=260">video shows</a> how the detective swings to nearby ledges like a Victorian Spider-Man, getting to areas that would otherwise prove difficult to reach.</p>
