<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Hideo Kojima has revealed that he crammed his ideas in a USB stick, claiming it&#8217;s like a &#8220;will&#8221; for his staff to use after his death.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you&#8217;re an avid gamer, then it&#8217;s almost impossible not to have heard about <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hideo-kojima-actually-wishes-death-stranding-2-was-more-controversial-3196005/">Hideo Kojima</a> at least once. The video game designer has been one of the most popular creators in the industry, known for his big break with <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/metal-gear-solid/">Metal Gear Solid</a> back in 1998.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s been over two decades since then, and yet, the man behind the well-known action-stealth franchise hasn&#8217;t stopped creating. Even in 2025, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/death-stranding-2-trailer-platforms-story-more-2006671/">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> looks to redefine the medium once more and he has plenty of other upcoming titles keeping him busy too.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While these are certainly exciting for fans, apparently Kojima has been giving some more thought to how many years he has left &#8220;to make a game&#8221; and the future of his company.</p> 



<h2 id="h-kojima-reveals-he-has-a-usb-stick-full-of-ideas-that&#8217;s-like-&#8220;a-will&#8221;" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Kojima reveals he has a USB stick full of ideas that&#8217;s like &#8220;a will&#8221;</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In an interview with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/az-magazines/6936449/edge-magazine-subscription.thtml">Edge Magazine</a>, the 61-year-old claimed that he has a USB stick containing game ideas for the Kojima Productions staff to use to continue making things when he dies.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Reflecting on his mortality, Kojima revealed that what happened to him during the pandemic was essentially an eye-opener.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">During that time, he &#8220;fell seriously ill&#8221; and also &#8220;had an eye operation,&#8221; which all led to him thinking: &#8220;Until then, I didn&#8217;t think I was old, you know? I just didn&#8217;t feel my age, and I assumed I would be able to create for as long as I live.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;But then I became sick, and I couldn&#8217;t create anything. And I saw lots of people around me passing away at that time. I was confronted with death,&#8221; he added.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Even after Kojima recovered, he couldn&#8217;t help but wonder how many years he still has left. &#8220;Wait, how many years do I have left to make game or a film?&#8217; Perhaps I have ten years?&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Since then, Kojima has also been rethinking his priorities. He mentioned that he considered directing a film, something that he previously <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-wants-to-explore-creating-films-and-music/">said</a> he&#8217;d like to explore. But directors such as Guillermo del Toro and Nicolas Winding Refn had different ideas, advising him to stick to games.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One thing for sure, however, is that Kojima already has plans for when the time comes, as he said: &#8220;I gave a USB stick with all my ideas on it to my personal assistant, kind of like a will.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Perhaps they could continue to make things after I&#8217;m gone at Kojima Productions&#8230; This is a fear for me: what happens to Kojima Productions after I&#8217;m gone? I don&#8217;t want them to just manage our existing IP.&#8221;</p>
