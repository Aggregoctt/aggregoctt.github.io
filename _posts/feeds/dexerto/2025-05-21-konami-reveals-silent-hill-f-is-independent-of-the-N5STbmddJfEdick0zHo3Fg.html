<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s Silent Hill, but not that Silent Hill. Konami finally admitted Silent Hill F isn&#8217;t a sequel.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Konami has spoken, and the verdict is in: Silent Hill f isn&#8217;t a sequel, just a totally standalone spinoff. So if you were clinging to the hope that it&#8217;d stitch together the mess left behind by Downpour or Homecoming&#8230; yeah, time to let go.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Set in 1960s rural Japan, Silent Hill f takes a sharp detour from the foggy American town fans know and dread. The game introduces us to Hinako Shimizu, a bullied schoolgirl with major trauma, vanishing friends, and a run-in with ominous fog. Oh, and flowers. Lots of them. Blooming in all the wrong ways.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s still the psychological horror. Still the eerie atmosphere. Still the potential for cults doing horrible cult things. But it&#8217;s all wrapped in a brand-new story that doesn&#8217;t touch the tangled lore of Pyramid Head and company.</p> 



<h2 id="h-konami-says-silent-hill-f-is-&#8220;independent-of-the-series&#8221;" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Konami says Silent Hill f is &#8220;independent of the series&#8221;</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Konami made it <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/silenthill_jp/status/1924736861156843894?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1924736861156843894%7Ctwgr%5E949e0c9fada48de3c4fa98930203717a382919d1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inoreader.com%2Farticle%2F3a9c6e773eafb373-live-service-games-are-innovating-all-the-way-back-around-to-what-worked-20-years-ago-except-way-worse">official on X</a>, saying:</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This is a completely new work, independent of the series. Even those who have never played Silent Hill can enjoy this game.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Silent Hill franchise kicked off in 1999 with fog, fear, and daddy issues, courtesy of Team Silent. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/everything-we-know-about-new-silent-hill-1826314/">Silent Hill 2</a> earned high praise from critics and players alike Then came sequels, spinoffs, and a slow, painful decline when Western studios took the wheel.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now Konami&#8217;s trying to resurrect the brand, Frankenstein-style, by launching a whole multiverse of titles: remakes, new stories, and global settings. Some smart bets (hello, Silent Hill 2 remake), some weird ones (lookin&#8217; at you, Short Message). And Silent Hill f, might just be their boldest move yet: no baggage, just fresh terror.</p>
