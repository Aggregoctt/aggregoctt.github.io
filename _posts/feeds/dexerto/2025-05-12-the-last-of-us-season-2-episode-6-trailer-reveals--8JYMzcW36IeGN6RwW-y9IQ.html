<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Pedro Pascal will return as Joel in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-3176859/">The Last of Us Season 2</a> Episode 6, and going by the trailer, it&#8217;s set to feature one of his most emotional scenes with Ellie from the game. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ellie&#8217;s mask finally slipped in Episode 5. After finding Nora at Lakehill Hospital, she chased her down into the spore-ridden basement and demanded information about Abby. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Nora refused, so Ellie resorted to desperate, violent measures: she grabbed a nearby pipe and started beating Nora. As she screamed, the episode cut to black&#8230; before returning to an earlier, happier time, showing Joel waking Ellie up in the morning. &#8220;Hey, kiddo.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That ending has teed up a &#8220;special&#8221; episode next week (directed by Neil Druckmann himself), and it&#8217;ll include a key flashback from <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/the-last-of-us/">The Last of Us</a> Part 2. Mild game spoilers to follow&#8230; </p>



<h2 id="h-joel-and-ellie-&#8216;go-to-space&#8217;-in-the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-6-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Joel and Ellie &#8216;go to space&#8217; in The Last of Us Season 2 Episode 6 </h2>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The first trailer for The Last of Us Season 2 Episode 6 confirms it&#8217;ll focus on Joel and Ellie, and there are a few glimpses of a big moment from Part 2: when Joel takes Ellie to the Wyoming Museum of Science and History for her 16th birthday. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the original game, it&#8217;s a playable flashback, following the pair as they trek through the woods to the museum as a surprise gift for Ellie. The trailer for the next episode even shows Ellie on top of a dinosaur, which is straight from the game. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Towards the end of the flashback, Joel and Ellie sit inside a space capsule, where he gives her a final present: a cassette tape with a recording of the Apollo 11 launch. </p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s an incredibly emotional, tender scene between the two characters, and it looks like it&#8217;ll be adapted almost shot-for-shot in Episode 6. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m gonna be crying for this entire episode! Can&#8217;t wait for the museum though,&#8221; one fan commented. &#8220;Finally!! The flashbacks!! And the museum &#8211; I better hear him utter those words, &#8216;Did I do okay?&#8217; I&#8217;m ready to cry,&#8221; another wrote.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ahead of Season 2&#8217;s release, Druckmann told <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/">Variety</a>: &#8220;[Episode 6] is really special because it really gets into the heart of what the show&#8217;s about with characters that we love so much&#8230; both fans of the show and fans of the games are going to be really moved [by it].&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Co-writer Halley Gross also said: &#8220;I think there is something incredibly special for [Episode 6]. I think six is a really beautiful story, and I&#8217;m really proud to have gotten to be a part of it.&#8221;</p>
