<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Bungie went on with their livestream AMA despite news breaking about them plagiarizing several art assets the day before, and confirmed that some planned post-launch content will have to be delayed.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">An artist noticed several assets in the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/how-to-sign-up-for-marathons-closed-alpha-test-3179404/">Marathon Alpha</a> that seemed familiar to her, and, upon closer inspection, she realized that some posters from her 2017 body of work were <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/marathon-called-out-by-artist-claiming-bungie-blatantly-stole-her-art-3196320/">ripped off directly</a> and ported right into the game.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Bungie responded a short time after, admitting their wrongdoing and promising to &#8220;make things right&#8221; with Antireal, the original group of artists behind that project.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In this livestream, it was revealed that this process is going to have a significant effect on Marathon moving forward. While they&#8217;re not delaying the game itself, they are going to have to slow post-launch content to make sure no more stolen work is present in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-bungie-delays-marathon-content-to-remove-stolen-art" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Bungie delays Marathon content to remove stolen art</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Marathon has already been delayed in the past. And, with Bungie winding down Destiny 2 content somewhat, it&#8217;s clear that the game must be released at this point, and that pushing it back further likely isn&#8217;t an option.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, them needing to go back in and now remove content from Marathon will have a lasting effect on development.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Joe Cross, Marathon&#8217;s Art Director, spoke on the controversy:</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It came to our attention that an artist who worked on Marathon in the early stages of pre-production took a number of graphic elements from a graphic designer without permission or acknowledgement that was then checked in in 2020,&#8221; he explained.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We are working on and are 100% committed to our review process to ensure instances like this don&#8217;t happen again, on Marathon or at Bungie.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He explained that, on top of working with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l">Antireal</a> to try and smooth things over, they&#8217;re also auditing all previous work from that artist and delaying early looks at the game.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This statement was part of a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qORBkGmHaoQ&amp;t=812s">so-called &#8220;PlayMA&#8221;</a> where the devs were meant to play the game and discuss it, but it was eerily quiet with no gameplay due to them not being able to show any of their plagiarized work.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">They didn&#8217;t provide details as to what &#8220;making it right&#8221; with the original artist, Fern, entails. Are they going to get some sort of financial compensation for the plagiarism? Did they reach out and offer to license the work so they could keep it in the game the way it was?</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Whatever conversation happened behind closed doors, it&#8217;s clear that Bungie plans to go scorched-earth and remove any art from the game that had her mark on it &#8211; even if that very art is a core part of the game&#8217;s visual identity at this point.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The original artist felt uncomfortable after looking at Marathon but didn&#8217;t have any concrete proof of them stealing her work. And, as you can see in work like what she has above, there are a ton of similarities to be drawn here.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It was kind of vindicating to see direct plagiarism because it meant I wasn&#8217;t crazy for feeling so uncomfortable with the overall direction,&#8221; artist <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/05/16/marathon-playstation-bungie-video-game/">Fern told the Washington post.</a> &#8220;I kept quiet about it because I was advised to seek legal action, but&#8230; I don&#8217;t have enough time or money to fly out to the U.S. to pursue an unwinnable court case against Sony.&#8221;</p>
