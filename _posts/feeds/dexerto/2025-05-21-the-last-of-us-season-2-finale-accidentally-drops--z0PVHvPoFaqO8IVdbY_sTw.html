<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One lucky fan has managed to see the final episode of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/the-last-of-us/">The Last of Us Season 2</a> early after Episode 7 dropped early on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/apple-tv/">Apple TV+</a>, but it&#8217;s revealed some bad news for the finale. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a now-deleted Reddit post, a user reported that their Apple TV+ Season Pass dropped Episode 7 early. They were able to watch it, showing proof (<strong>huge spoiler warning</strong>) <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://imgur.com/a/pNE7bLE">here</a>. After they gave out some very big spoilers, no surprise, the post has now been taken down. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s one big problem, though &#8211; the finale is only 49 minutes long. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-of-us-s2-episode-7-is-one-of-the-shortest-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">The Last of Us S2 Episode 7 is one of the shortest </h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This makes Episode 7 the second shortest episode of the season, only a couple of minutes longer than <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-spores-explained-3188494/">Episode 5</a>, Feel Her Love, in which Ellie hunts down Nora and savagely beats her for information. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Pacing has been one of the biggest complaints around Season 2, where we&#8217;ve only had two episodes of Ellie and Dina&#8217;s revenge tour of Seattle so far. In fact, these Seattle-based episodes will be the three shortest of the season. </p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With the narrative taking us back to Seattle following <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-2-just-made-its-biggest-joel-ellie-mistake-in-episode-6-3196665/">Episode 6</a>&#8216;s heart-wrenching flashbacks, there&#8217;s less than an hour to wrap up Ellie&#8217;s arc before we have a long wait before Season 3, which isn&#8217;t expected to start filming until 2026. Spoilers from here&#8230;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Like the second portion of the game, The Last of Us Season 3 is set to focus almost entirely on Kaitlyn Dever&#8217;s Abby &#8211; <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-star-drops-big-clue-for-how-season-2-ends-before-finale-3197964/">Catherine O&#8217;Hara has said as much</a>. Perhaps we&#8217;ll even spend more time with Abby in Seattle than we did with Ellie. </p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, we have less than an hour with Ellie before we see her again later in Season 3, which probably won&#8217;t be until 2027. </p>
