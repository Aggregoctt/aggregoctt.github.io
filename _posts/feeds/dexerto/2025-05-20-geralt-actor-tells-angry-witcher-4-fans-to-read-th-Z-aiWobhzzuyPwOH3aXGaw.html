<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The voice actor behind Geralt has responded to the backlash of Ciri being the protagonist of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/the-witcher/">The Witcher 4</a>, urging angry fans to &#8220;read the damn books.&#8221; </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Although GTA 6 takes the prize for being the most anticipated game currently in development, The Witcher 4 isn&#8217;t too far behind. Even a decade on from its initial release, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-witcher-3-is-still-the-gold-standard-for-rpgs-even-after-10-years-3195887/">The Witcher 3 is still regarded as one of the best RPGs ever made</a>, so fans are eager to get their hands on the sequel. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, when it was initially revealed back in 2024, it received backlash for <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/new-witcher-4-trailer-finally-reveals-the-games-protagonist-3006206/">placing Ciri as the main character</a> over Geralt, who was the focus of the first three games. Although <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/geralt-shows-up-in-the-witcher-4-trailer-with-easy-to-miss-cameo-3006507/">his voice was heard in the trailer</a>, suggesting he&#8217;ll appear in some capacity. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now, the voice actor who plays Geralt, Doug Cockle, has responded to the criticism, arguing that it&#8217;s time for his character to take a back seat. </p> 



<h2 id="h-geralt-actor-doug-cockle-responds-to-ciri-backlash" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Geralt actor Doug Cockle responds to Ciri backlash</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">During an interview with Dexerto&#8217;s Fall Damage, Cockle was presented with social media posts and memes about The Witcher 4. One of these referenced the argument that the sequel had gone &#8220;woke&#8221; by making Ciri, Geralt&#8217;s adoptive daughter, the protagonist. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The actor called the argument &#8220;stupid,&#8221; explaining that it was time for the series to put the spotlight on a different hero. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It&#8217;s not woke, there&#8217;s nothing woke about it,&#8221; he said in the interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a cool character from the Witcher, and they&#8217;re gonna focus on that character.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I think that&#8217;s awesome. You can&#8217;t just have Geralt for every single game for The Witcher ad nauseam through eternity.&#8221;</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He went on to say that Geralt&#8217;s story was wrapped up nicely in The Witcher 3 DLC, so he has no issues with another character taking center stage in the follow-up.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen the end of Geralt&#8217;s journey,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Blood and Wine&#160;was supposed to wrap up Geralt&#8217;s journey.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Witcher 3 is the first time that Ciri appeared in the games, which might go some way to explain why some fans have had a hard time adapting to the new perspective. However, Cockle also mentioned that there are plenty of interesting stories to tell about Ciri, before urging those upset about her new role to take a look at the source material:</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;There&#8217;s a whole rich world of stuff to explore with Ciri, that they didn&#8217;t do when they put her into Witcher 3, because the story was about Geralt. But she hints at it. If you think it&#8217;s woke, read the damn books. They&#8217;re good, first of all. And secondly, you won&#8217;t think it&#8217;s so woke anymore.&#8221;</p>
