<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In last week&#8217;s episode of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/the-last-of-us/">The Last of Us</a>, Ellie&#8217;s mask finally slipped. After cornering Nora in Lakehill (in a basement full of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-spores-explained-3188494/">spores</a>), she refused to give up information about Abby&#8217;s whereabouts&#8230; so Ellie beat her with a pipe. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As she swung down, the episode cut to black, before flashing back to Joel waking Ellie up on a much earlier, more peaceful morning. That&#8217;s the set-up for Episode 6, focused entirely on Joel and Ellie between the end of Season 1 and the start of Season 2. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That means we could find out if Ellie knows about Joel&#8217;s lie, and we&#8217;ll get answers about <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-2-eugene-explained-3177656/">Eugene</a>. </p>
