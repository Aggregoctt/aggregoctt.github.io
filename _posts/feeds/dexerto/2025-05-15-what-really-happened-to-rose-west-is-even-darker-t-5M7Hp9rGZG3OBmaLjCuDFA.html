Warning: some may find this content distressing.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/new-documentaries-true-crime-netflix-hulu-prime-streaming-2271621/">new true crime</a> title is three episodes long, first focusing on Fred West, then Rose and their relationship, and finally the trial and the scandal surrounding <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/why-did-fred-west-need-appropriate-adult-janet-leach-netflix-documentary-3195446/">Fred&#8217;s appropriate adult Janet Leach</a>.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the case, Fred and Rose West were a married couple with 10 children who, quite literally, had secrets buried at their Gloucestershire &#8220;house of horrors&#8221;. Together, they would prey on, torture, sexually assault and, in some cases, murder young women.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Their reign of terror lasted for decades, until the police were alerted to a sick family &#8220;joke&#8221; about the couple&#8217;s daughter, Heather West, being buried underneath the patio. They were finally arrested in 1994, with detectives uncovering 12 murders between them.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-what-happened-to-rose-west?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">What happened to Rose West?</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After Fred died by suicide in prison on January 1, 1995, Rose was found guilty of 10 murders and sentenced to life in prison. She&#8217;s still alive, aged 71 now, but what Fred and Rose West: A British Horror Story doesn&#8217;t reveal is her life behind bars &#8211; including her twisted relationship with fellow UK <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-serial-killer-documentaries-true-crime-2585711/">serial killer</a>, Myra Hindley.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Yes, that Myra Hindley &#8211; one half of the Moors Murderers, who, alongside Ian Brady, lured, tortured, and killed five children in the 1960s. Hindley was widely seen as the most hated woman in Britain.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">She recorded the cries of a girl she helped murder and then posed smiling near a victim&#8217;s grave. Much like the Wests, the Moors Murderers&#8217; crimes embodied evil. Before Hindley&#8217;s death in 2002 while behind bars, she was locked up at Durham Prison alongside Rose.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the 2020 true crime <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/documentary/">documentary</a> Rose West and Myra Hindley: Their Untold Story with Trevor McDonald, former inmates said the pair formed a bond during their incarceration, which they claimed developed into a romantic relationship.&#160;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ex prisoner and crime author Linda Calvey described how the fellow child killers would share breakfasts, have tea, and go to the chapter together. &#8220;They&#8217;d go into each other&#8217;s cells and they became really, really close,&#8221; she said.&#160;&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I think the majority of the wing all thought there was an affair of sorts going on between them. Everybody went, &#8216;What a weird combination, they&#8217;ve become thick as thieves.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Meanwhile, Rose&#8217;s former attorney, Leo Goatley, said she would speak about Hindley with admiration. He also wrote in his book Understanding Fred and Rose West that they were in a &#8220;flowering, albeit short-lived, lesbian relationship&#8221;.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, their bond was said to have broken down shortly after, with Calvey alleging that Hindley said of Rose, &#8220;Yeah, well, I thought about it. She killed her own children. Do I really want to mix with someone like that?&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">These claims have never been confirmed by either Hindley or Rose, but we know that whatever friendship they did have would have ended indefinitely when the former was transferred from Durham to HMP Highpoint in Suffolk in early 1998.</p> 



<h2 id="h-rose-west&#8217;s-life-in-prison" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Rose West&#8217;s life in prison</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As for the rest of Rose&#8217;s time in prison, her life behind bars has been marked by isolation and controversy. In 2019, she was transferred from HMP Low Newton to HMP New Hall in West Yorkshire due to security concerns.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The move aimed to ensure her safety after threats from fellow inmates, including serial killer Joanna Dennehy, who had expressed intentions to harm Rose.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Prior to this, former Low Newton prisoner Catherine Jones <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/rose-west-believes-forgiven-god-13103428">claimed</a> in 2018 that Rose had turned to religion, saying, &#8220;She really believes she&#8217;ll be forgiven when she dies. Will she? She put her own daughter under the patio.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, Jones went on to claim that Rose still hadn&#8217;t taken responsibility for her crimes. &#8220;Rose blamed Fred for &#173;everything. She said he bullied her and made her do things.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In Rose West and Myra Hindley: Their Untold Story with Trevor McDonald, Calvey described an incident whereby Rose&#8217;s cell was set on fire, causing her to be &#8220;foaming at the mouth&#8221; with rage.&#160;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;There were about three arsonists on the wing. There had been a spate of three or four cells being set on fire. Her budgie was left in, so they brought the budgie out and it was all sooty and black,&#8221; said Calvey.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Well, Rose was absolutely hysterical about her budgie. She said, &#8216;How could anyone be so evil to light a fire and leave the budgie in a room?&#8230; Suddenly you saw this switch to this absolutely raging creature, like a demon.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;She was foaming at the mouth, she was so enraged. Nobody should hurt an animal. But they can murder a child without blinking their eyes yet get hysterical over animals. I don&#8217;t get how their brains work.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Following the release of the new <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/shocking-netflix-documentaries-2890798/">Netflix docu-series</a>, Goatley &#8211;&#160;who was Rose&#8217;s lawyer for 12 years &#8211; said her life behind bars has been, from what he can gather, up and down. &#8220;If she wrote to me, it was normally about things happening in the prison where she was,&#8221; he told <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/reports/a64743744/rose-west-now/#what-is-rose-wests-life-like-now">Cosmopolitan UK</a>.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;They would have these routine cell searches, and she&#8217;d have to move all her things out of her cell, which she found very disruptive. Also, the prison regime changes over time. Initially, she was on a wing, and they were all lifers, so they felt fairly settled and had routines.&#160;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;They then brought younger women prisoners in, who were in for 12 months, 18 months, who were pretty wild and were out for fights to show who had the bragging rights, this sort of thing. Some people were trying to set fire to Rose&#8217;s cell and she had problems in the kitchen.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Beyond that, the regime stopped giving classes. She liked to go and do sewing or whatever. It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if she was a model prisoner, but when someone else kicks off, I have no doubt Rose would stand up to them. She wasn&#8217;t frightened. I think it&#8217;s probably more settled now.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Goatley continued, &#8220;I did write to her a couple of years ago, maybe three years ago, to say that I concluded that she was clearly guilty, because I hadn&#8217;t said you&#8217;re guilty. I was kind of on the fence, I suppose, with that for many years, but I concluded that she was guilty.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;She must have known what Fred was doing. In some of the cases, because of all the damage in her childhood and abuse, she may have taken a lead in some of the violence. So I did confront her in this letter and say that. I didn&#8217;t say all that, I just said, &#8216;I think you&#8217;re guilty.&#8217; But I didn&#8217;t get a reply.&#8221;</p>
