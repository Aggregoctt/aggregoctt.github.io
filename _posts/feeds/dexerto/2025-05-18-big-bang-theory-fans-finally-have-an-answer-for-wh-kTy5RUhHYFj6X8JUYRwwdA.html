<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/cbs-show-renewals-2025-2026-ghosts-georgie-mandy-fire-country-3139837/">CBS</a> first announced a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/young-sheldon/">Young Sheldon</a> spinoff, its title quickly drew criticism. While we know Georgie ends up single in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/the-big-bang-theory/">The Big Bang Theory</a>, does he actually ever divorce Mandy?</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As far as titles go, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/georgie-and-mandys-first-marriage-everything-we-know-2691248/">Georgie &amp; Mandy&#8217;s First Marriage</a> is a pretty wordy one. However, it&#8217;s also intriguing, with it clearly alluding to more than one round of nuptials. Adult Georgie is a single bachelor, with a string of ex-wives and girlfriends behind him when we first meet him in TBBT.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, it&#8217;s never too clear who these women actually are. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/will-sheldon-be-in-the-georgie-mandy-spinoff-2691293/">Sheldon</a> is congratulated by two different ex-wives when he wins his Nobel prize, but as far as we know, Mandy is the only woman Georgie has wed.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Of course, there&#8217;s still a major gap between the two stories, but what if Georgie and Mandy married more than once? The theory has been floated before, and now one of the spinoff&#8217;s stars has weighed in on what might be further down the line.</p> 



<h2 id="h-georgie-and-mandy-could-have-as-many-as-three-marriages-by-big-bang-theory" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Georgie and Mandy could have as many as three marriages by Big Bang Theory</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking to Dexerto, star Montana Jordan said fans could eventually see as many as three marriages if the Georgie &amp; Mandy spinoff continues beyond its confirmed second season. </p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s great about it is this [question] is what keeps the audience on their toes,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;They get in these bickering fights and disagreements and all this and all that, but you&#8217;ve got to push through, that&#8217;s the reality of it. When you&#8217;re a young couple and have just had a newborn, there are some things that you have to push through. That&#8217;s the real life of it. </p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;But like you&#8217;re saying, the title is Georgie and Mandy&#8217;s First Marriage. Whether there&#8217;s a second or third marriage, there ain&#8217;t no telling. But I&#8217;ll be there regardless.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/georgie-mandy-wedding-completely-changes-young-sheldon-sequel-2640209/">Georgie and Mandy</a> so popular as a couple, many fans have hoped that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/young-sheldon-georgie-mandy-relationship-2548816/">they are endgame</a>, making this first marriage theory more likely. However, this isn&#8217;t just a conclusion that viewers want, but also Mandy star Emily Osment herself.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I&#8217;m hoping that I&#8217;m the ex-wife and the new wife,&#8221; Emily Osment <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://tvline.com/interviews/young-sheldon-spinoff-georgie-mandy-cast-interview-video-1235192346/">explained</a> when she was asked about the storyline by TV Line. &#8220;People get divorced and then they get remarried. Why can&#8217;t she [Mandy] be both?&#8221;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Another popular fan theory is that Georgie&#8217;s high-school crush Veronica comes back on the scene, and eventually becomes his <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/who-is-georgies-second-wife-young-sheldon-fans-have-a-theory-2743721/">second wife</a>. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Veronica wasn&#8217;t seen in Young Sheldon after Season 3, where it was quietly hinted that she spent the rest of her life dedicated to charity work. After finding God in Season 2, Georgie also tries to devote himself to faith in order to date her, which doesn&#8217;t work out.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Season 3 finds Georgie and Veronica developing a friendship, eventually asking Veronica&#8217;s permission to ask Jana Owens out, staying with her into Season 4.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">What actually lies in store for Georgie&#8217;s love life remains to be seen, but don&#8217;t expect him to be divorcing Mandy during Season 2. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Georgie &amp; Mandy&#8217;s First Marriage Season 2 is expected to premiere this fall.
