<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In this <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdMBChercPY">interview with Nintendo</a>, Randy Varnell, the game&#8217;s Chief Creative Officer, revealed Gearbox started working on Borderlands 4 way back in 2019, right after Borderlands 3 shipped. That&#8217;s six years of development, putting it in the same ballpark as <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/gta-6/">GTA 6</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While Rockstar&#8217;s opus has hogged headlines for its endless wait, Borderlands 4 has quietly matched its timeline. Varnell confirmed the long haul in a new interview, saying they&#8217;ve spent &#8220;every one of those years&#8221; building out the next chaotic chapter. Turns out, it&#8217;s not just Rockstar that takes its sweet time.</p> 



 



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-has-been-cooking-for-ages-&#8212;-just-not-gta-6-ages" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Borderlands 4 has been cooking for ages &#8212; Just not GTA 6 ages</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Borderlands 4 introduces a brand-new planet, Kairos, a fresh crew of Vault Hunters, and traversal mechanics that finally make getting around as fun as blowing stuff up.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s still cel-shaded, still loud, still weird, but now bigger, more seamless, and with <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/borderlands-4-ceo-reveals-it-has-zero-load-times-despite-being-biggest-universe-in-franchise-3194226/">zero loading screens</a>. No PS4. No Xbox One. Just PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC (Steam + Epic), and the Nintendo Switch 2. It drops September 12, 2025 &#8212; moved up from its original release date because Gearbox is feeling bold, which is only natural after six years of work behind the scenes.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That timeline also reflects a growing reality in AAA development: six-year cycles are the norm now, not the exception.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Borderlands 4 followed a staggered development path: some devs moved to other projects, others prototyped in the background before full production kicked in.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rockstar did the same: GTA 6 didn&#8217;t really get rolling until Red Dead Redemption 2 launched in 2018. These aren&#8217;t direct sequels churned out in factory lines; they&#8217;re slow-cooked chaos machines.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">And let&#8217;s not forget how the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2-2179693/">Switch 2</a> factored into that timeline. Gearbox isn&#8217;t just porting Borderlands 4, they&#8217;re building for it. Varnell gushed about the hardware, saying it lets them create a true co-op experience in a seamless open world. &#8220;We&#8217;re not fighting the system,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The system&#8217;s enabling us and empowering us to make the best version of Borderlands 4 we can. &#8221; That&#8217;s high praise in dev-speak.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So yes, Borderlands 4 has taken its time. But if six years gets us the biggest, boldest entry yet, bring it on. September 12 can&#8217;t come fast enough.</p>
