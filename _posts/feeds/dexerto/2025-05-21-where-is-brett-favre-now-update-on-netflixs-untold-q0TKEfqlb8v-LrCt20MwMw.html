<div> 
<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Once hailed as a small-town hero and one of the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/nfl/">NFL&#8217;s</a> most beloved quarterbacks, Brett Favre is now better known for his ties to the largest welfare scandal in Mississippi history, as is explored in Untold: The Fall of Favre.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/netflix/">Netflix&#8217;s</a> Untold is a series of documentaries, with each episode centering on a different <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/true-crime/">true crime</a> case or scandal related to the world of sports. Its latest chapter includes deep dives on the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/gilbert-arenas-javaris-crittenton-now-netflix-untold-shooting-guards-3190707/">Gilbert Arenas and Javaris Crittenton</a> controversy, followed by the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/is-the-liver-king-on-steroids-allegations-netflix-documentary-untold-3194841/">Liver King</a>.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now, it&#8217;s focusing on Favre, who rose to fame as the face of the Green Bay Packers in the 1990s and 2000s, earning three consecutive MVP awards and leading the team to a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/super-bowl/">Super Bowl</a> victory in 1997.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As Reverend Reggie Warnsley says in the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/new-documentaries-true-crime-netflix-hulu-prime-streaming-2271621/">new documentary</a>, &#8220;He threw the pass like he was throwing a 70-yard bomb,&#8221; a characteristic that earned Favre the nickname &#8220;gunslinger.&#8221; However, off the pitch, his reputation has been far more complicated.</p> 



<h2 id="h-where-is-brett-favre-now?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Where is Brett Favre now?</h2>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Brett Favre is still in his home state of Mississippi, living in a 19,000 square feet, five bedroom house with his wife, Deanna, who he shares two daughters with: Brittany and Breleigh.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Favre has continued to dabble in sports broadcasting and brand endorsements, although some sponsors have quietly distanced themselves. His most recent Instagram post was shared last year when he announced the 2024 movie Concussed, about Super Bowl winner Tyler Sash, with Favre serving as executive producer.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In 2020, he found himself at the center of the Mississippi welfare scandal, whereby a number of high-profile figures allegedly misused at least $77 million that was meant to help the poorest individuals in the state.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Favre was implicated in the scheme, as a state audit revealed that he was paid $1.1 million for speaking events that he didn&#8217;t take part in. He was also accused of seeking help to redirect $5 million from the funds to build a volleyball stadium at the University of Southern Mississippi, where his daughter played the sport.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-did-he-go-to-prison?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Did he go to prison?</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Despite the serious allegations tied to the welfare scandal, Favre has not been criminally charged. He has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that he was unaware the funds he lobbied for came from money intended for Mississippi&#8217;s most vulnerable residents.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, he was named in a 2022 civil lawsuit by the state, which is seeking to recover millions of misused welfare dollars. Public records show that Favre repaid the $1.1 million he personally received for speeches he never gave, but the state still wants repayment of interest.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The fallout has tarnished Favre&#8217;s once squeaky-clean image. While some fans and media figures continue to defend him, others view his role in the scandal &#8211; along with past controversies, like the 2008 Jenn Sterger allegations &#8211; as part of a broader pattern of misconduct that was historically overlooked due to his star power.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Former NFL quarterback Michael Vick says in the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/shocking-netflix-documentaries-2890798/">Netflix documentary</a>, &#8220;People go to jail for stealing money everyday. If it&#8217;s that important, the right institutions can get involved. But, you know, some people are untouchable in certain ways and that&#8217;s just the way it is.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I just think that&#8217;s kinda how the system is rigged. You know, some situations have to be played out in court. Some have to be played out in the public.&#8221;</p>



 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Elsewhere in the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/documentary/">documentary</a>, it&#8217;s revealed that Favre&#8217;s revelation of his Parkinson&#8217;s disease diagnosis during a congressional hearing in September 2024 added a complex layer to his ongoing narrative. While he framed the announcement as a personal testament to the importance of concussion research, critics have questioned the timing. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Given that the disclosure came amid intense scrutiny over his alleged involvement in the misappropriation of Mississippi welfare funds, some observers viewed it as a strategic move to elicit sympathy and redirect the conversation.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Parkinson&#8217;s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and can lead to tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination. Favre, who has publicly acknowledged experiencing numerous concussions during his 20-year NFL career, expressed concerns about his future health, stating, &#8220;It makes me wonder what the future brings for me.&#8221; </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As of May 2025, there have been no significant public updates regarding his condition.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In Untold: The Fall of Favre, Jenn Sterger, a former New York Jets employee who accused Favre of sending unsolicited explicit messages in 2008, commented on the broader impact of his actions. &#8220;The people that get left in the wake are the victims&#8230; we get left in the wake because we were never the story,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We&#8217;re here to service somebody else&#8217;s story.&#8221;</p>
