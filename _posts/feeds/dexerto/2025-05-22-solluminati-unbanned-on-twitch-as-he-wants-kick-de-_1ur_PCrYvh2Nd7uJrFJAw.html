<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Streamer SoLLUMINATI has been unbanned by Twitch after releasing a YouTube video about his most recent ban, and threatening to leave for KICK.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Back in early May, SoLLUMINATI was unbanned by <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/">Twitch</a> after having been banned from the Amazon-owned platform for five years. Despite a successful return to the platform, he has already copped two bans.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">His first, which came on May 4, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/twitch-streamer-unbanned-after-five-years-reveals-he-had-to-pass-test-to-get-ban-lifted-3190484/">prompted Twitch to hand him a test about &#8220;hateful&#8221; conduct.</a> SoLLUMINATI claimed he passed that with flying colors and didn&#8217;t get any of the questions wrong. His ban, however, came on May 20, shortly after he had close to 90,000 viewers during an NBA 2K wage stream.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As per Twitch&#8217;s procedures, they haven&#8217;t shared the reason for the ban. However, SoLLUMINATI has since been unbanned, and it came after he made a YouTube video threatening to leave for KICK.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-solluminati-urges-kick-to-sign-him-up-from-twitch" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">SoLLUMINATI urges KICK to sign him up from Twitch</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This time, I really don&#8217;t know why I got banned. We all seen it, I have no clue why I got banned,&#8221; he said in his video. &#8220;The only thing I can say is they seen that I hit 87,000 viewers. I don&#8217;t know what I did, y&#8217;all tell me.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The streamer repeated that he doesn&#8217;t &#8220;feel safe&#8221; on Twitch now that he has two bans in a month, and called on Adin Ross to sign him up to Kick.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Adin, KICK, y&#8217;all time has come. I just had 87,000 viewers, it is time for y&#8217;all to spoil me. KICK, I think we&#8217;ve got to bring the culture and drama to KICK, y&#8217;all.&#8221;</p>



 



<h2 id="h-adin-ross-&#8216;welcomes&#8217;-solluminati-to-kick" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Adin Ross &#8216;welcomes&#8217; SoLLUMINATI to KICK</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It didn&#8217;t take long for Ross to &#8220;welcome&#8221; SoLLUMINATI to the Stake-backed platform. &#8220;Chat, SoLLUMINATI is going to come to KICK. It is happening. It is happening sooner than we all think,&#8221; he confirmed. &#8220;SoLLUMINATI, welcome to KICK.&#8221;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Adin also addressed SoLLUMINATI&#8217;s viewers who don&#8217;t want him to make the jump, questioning if they want him to be &#8220;held back&#8221; by Twitch&#8217;s bans.&#160;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">SoLLUMINATI also revealed that he is scrapping a number of big IRL streams that he had planned to host on Twitch following the new suspension.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Twitch don&#8217;t even deserve me, man. I&#8217;m talking about bringing IRLs to Twitch and all this s**t? Man, y&#8217;all don&#8217;t even deserve me, man.&#8221;</p>
