<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Overwatch 2 developers have revealed which heroes are being banned the most in every role, with one character not being playable in over 90% of games.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In Season 16, Overwatch finally <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-devs-reveal-how-hero-bans-will-work-in-season-16-3182376/">introduced hero bans</a>, giving players the opportunity to shift the game&#8217;s meta in wildly different ways by removing certain characters from the equation.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The bans have been seen as a major success so far, albeit some players, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2s-hero-ban-system-is-making-life-miserable-for-one-tricks-3185498/">such as Mercy mains</a>, have been upset with the feature as they struggle to use other heroes.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 23, the devs finally unveiled data for hero bans on console and PC, with one hero standing high above the rest in terms of how often they&#8217;re banned.</p>



<h2 id="h-sombra-is-banned-in-over-90%-of-overwatch-2-games-on-console" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Sombra is banned in over 90% of Overwatch 2 games on console</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a May 2025 <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24205940/weekly-recall-hero-bans/">blog post</a>, the devs revealed that Sombra has an 85% ban rate on PC &#8211; while on console, it&#8217;s even higher at 93%.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Sombra has been an incredibly controversial hero despite receiving a handful of reworks, but common issues with her kit have remained throughout her introduction to the game back in 2016.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Primarily, fans <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2s-worst-designed-hero-is-finally-getting-a-much-needed-nerf-2638794/">dislike playing against a hero</a> who has both invisibility and a disable as part of their kit &#8211; something that has remained in all variations of the Talon hacker.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In second place on PC, it&#8217;s Zarya at 59%, followed by Doomfist at 43%. On console, it&#8217;s Zarya at 57% and Symmetra at 23%.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Meanwhile, for players who are Masters and above on PC, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-players-want-hero-more-annoying-than-sombra-nerfed-3195892/">Freja</a> is the most banned hero. However, Sombra remains the most banned hero in Masters+ on console.</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As for supports, Ana is the most banned on PC, while Mercy has been banned the most on console.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The developers say that this data will help them when it comes to future <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/patch-notes/">balance patches</a>, but it&#8217;s important to note that ban statistics alone won&#8217;t be responsible for which heroes get nerfs and buffs.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That said, it certainly seems like Sombra could be in line for yet another rework down the road based on these overwhelming stats.</p>
