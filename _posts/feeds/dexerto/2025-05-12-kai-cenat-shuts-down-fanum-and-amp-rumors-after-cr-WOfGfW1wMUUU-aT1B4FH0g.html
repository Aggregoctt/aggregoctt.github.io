<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Kai Cenat has shut down claims that Fanum left AMP after the Twitch star made several posts that led fans to believe he had.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In early May, Fanum&#8217;s social media posts on X and Snapchat heavily suggested he had left AMP. He claimed they unfollowed him and removed his access to the account in one post, and followed it up with other comments.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;They sold they soul, they mad I won&#8217;t do it,&#8221; he said on Snapchat. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fanum added on Twitter: &#8220;They forget all the sh*t that I did, I was feeding the team when I didn&#8217;t have sh*t. I was taking a risk, I done got all of us rich.&#8221; </p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After these posts, Fanum went silent, not addressing the furor that he had caused, with fans concerned there had been a falling out in the group. However, fellow member <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/kai-cenat/">Kai Cenat</a> has shut down the speculation entirely.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go ahead and address the elephant in the room,&#8221; Kai said during his May 10 stream. &#8220;Y&#8217;all need to be studied. How the f**k yall get bamboozled into thinking Fanum left AMP? Everybody who fell for Fanum leaving AMP, I&#8217;m not going to lie&#8230; that just goes to show how much y&#8217;all actually watch [us].</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;You being on X and looking at captions or looking at a video that&#8217;s clipped out of context&#8230; you can&#8217;t always believe that sh*t. Especially on X, that&#8217;s where it stems from.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He added: &#8220;Did you hear Fanum out of his mouth say &#8216;I&#8217;m out&#8217;? Did you hear any of us say that? No, bro, you can&#8217;t always believe shit on the internet.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Kai also shared that he was hanging out with Fanum, and the AMP star was &#8220;confused&#8221; about the rumors going around social media. </p>
