<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has teased a potential collab with Street Fighter 6, which could give players another chance to claim some more layered armor.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 19, Capcom posted an image of a Palico&#8217;s paw on a blue background that has striking similarities to Street Fighter&#8217;s spray-painted backgrounds. The comparisons are even clearer when looking through <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1922714549146325315">Street Fighter 6&#8217;s official social media posts</a>.  </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If true, this wouldn&#8217;t be the first time Monster Hunter has collaborated with Street Fighter. Back in September 2020, Monster Hunter World players could famously earn Ryu and Sakura layered armor by taking down monsters.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-x-street-fighter-6-collab-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Monster Hunter Wilds x Street Fighter 6 collab  </h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This trend continued in August 2021, when <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/reviews/monster-hunter-rise-review-1543004/">Monster Hunter Rise</a> released a layered armor set for Akuma, Street Fighter&#8217;s demonic antagonist. The set was notable for transforming Sword and Shield attacks into kicks and punches, while kunai attacks were converted into Akuma&#8217;s iconic Gohadoken and the Zanku Hadoken moves.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/street-fighter/">Street Fighter 6</a> also famously teamed with Capcom&#8217;s monster-slaying series to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Monster Hunter. During the event, players could purchase the Rathalos armor avatar outfit, emotes, and special titles.&#160;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, it certainly wouldn&#8217;t be unheard of for Monster Hunter Wilds to receive some Street Fighter-themed goodies. While Capcom has yet to reveal what the collab will entail, it will likely require players to fight monsters to earn a free armor set.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/monster-hunter-wilds-dlc-roadmap-all-upcoming-expansions-3131253/">Monster Hunter Wild&#8217;s DLC roadmap</a> notes that the version 1.011 update will be released at the end of May, so we&#8217;ll likely know more about the upcoming collab then. It&#8217;s also important to note that the crossover will launch before Title Update 2, which means if the collab is Street Fighter themed, you&#8217;ll be able to take down Lagiacrus in style.&#160;</p>
