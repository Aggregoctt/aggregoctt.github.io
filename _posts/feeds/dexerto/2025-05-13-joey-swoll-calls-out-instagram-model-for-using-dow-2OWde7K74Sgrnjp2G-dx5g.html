<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">TikToker Joey Swoll has called out an Instagram model for using a filter that makes them look like they have Down syndrome.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/down-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355977">Mayo Clinic</a>, Down syndrome is a genetic condition that leads to an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21. This extra genetic material causes developmental changes and unique physical features.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Apps like <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tiktok/">TikTok</a> and Instagram offer filters to change your appearance, and allow users to create their own for others to use. One of these includes one that makes you look like you have the physical features of a person with Down syndrome, and using it often sparks backlash among viewers.</p> 



<h2 id="h-joey-swoll-calls-out-use-of-down-syndrome-filter" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Joey Swoll calls out use of Down syndrome filter</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This is disgusting and evil. What&#8217;s worse is that there are sick people that actually subscribe!&#8221; <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tiktok/who-is-joey-swoll-on-tiktok-viral-coach-combats-toxic-fitness-culture-1803850/">Joey Swoll</a> said in the caption of his video. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the clip, you can see a woman walking across a train platform using the Down Syndrome filter. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Here is another disgusting example of somebody using an AI filter to pretend to have Down syndrome in order to sell more subscriptions to their OnlyFans,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This video had over 70 million views and over 900,000 likes. I can&#8217;t even believe that a filter like this even exists. If you&#8217;re somebody that supports this or you subscribe to them, you are sick in the head. You are part of the problem.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I will call out every single account that does this until this evil is off the internet.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This isn&#8217;t the first time Joey has called out an account using the filter, either. On April 30, he posted a video mentioning a different account, and the next day, it was removed from Instagram, and her OnlyFans account was banned. </p>
