<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The long-awaited remaster of GTA IV could actually fill the gap in Rockstar&#8217;s release schedule amid GTA 6&#8217;s delay, according to one prominent insider.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 2, Rockstar Games dealt a blow to the hearts of Grand Theft Auto fans as they finally confirmed that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-officially-delayed-until-2026-3189190/">GTA 6 would be delayed until May 26, 2026.&#160;</a></p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The news of the delay was quickly followed by <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-trailer-2-finally-reveals-more-story-details-3190524/">a second trailer,</a> showing off a better look at the modern-day Vice City that fans are eager to jump into, as well as some more details about the main characters, Jason and Lucia.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, that delay has presented a space in Rockstar&#8217;s release schedule for something else. And, well, according to renowned leaker TezFun, it might be an opportunity for the Grand Theft Auto devs to finally release their GTA IV remake on new consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-delay-could-be-good-news-for-gta-4-remaster" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">GTA 6 delay could be good news for GTA 4 remaster</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That&#8217;s right, according to the leaker, Rockstar could finally drop the long-awaited GTA IV remaster in the window that<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/gta-6/"> GTA 6</a> has left.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Someone at R* hinted at the IV port, and by now it should&#8217;ve gone up a year in development. We may end up seeing it drop later this year,&#8221; the leaker <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1001944-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2/page/90/#comment-1072547918">posted</a> on GTAForums on May 11.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;And it&#8217;s one more reason, in addition to existing reasons, the LCPP (Liberty City Preservation Project) mod was taken down. If they still follow their plan laid out from the pandemic days, they&#8217;ll do an MP3 (Max Payne 3) port after IV.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The GTA IV remaster is something that has been rumored for quite some time. As Tez notes, fuel was only added to that fire <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/rockstar-games-shuts-down-gta-5s-amazing-liberty-city-mod-3032150/">when Rockstar shut down a Liberty City mod in GTA V</a> earlier this year.</p>
