<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Kai Cenat has warned viewers that they may face police action if they trespass on the Streamer University campus.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Back in February, Kai Cenat revealed that he had plans to launch a Streamer University in order to help some up-and-coming creators. He had big ideas,<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/mrbeast-responds-to-kai-cenats-streamer-university-as-twitch-star-wants-him-involved-3193064/"> including bringing the likes of MrBeast in</a> to help teach classes, and having his own university campus.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fast forward to May, and that idea is now a reality. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/kai-cenat-finally-launches-streamer-university-everyone-wants-in-3190825/">Kai has enrolled 150 streamers</a> to his program, and has enlisted the help of DDG and Extra Emily, as well as others, to teach the classes.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The project had well over 600,000 viewers on it&#8217;s first day, as Kai welcomed everyone to the University of Akron campus. However, fans aren&#8217;t welcome to interrupt things, and the Twitch star has the help of the police if they do.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-kai-warns-viewers-they&#8217;ll-be-arrested-for-attending-streamer-university" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Kai warns viewers they&#8217;ll be arrested for attending Streamer University</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After going live on the first day of Streamer University, Kai showed off his office and moved quickly to warn fans about trespassing on campus.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Let&#8217;s clear some s**t up real quick. If you don&#8217;t belong on this campus, I&#8217;m telling you, I am now live, so rules come into play&#8230; real life though,&#8221; he <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2465650327">said</a>.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;First of all, think, do not ruin something. If you are caught, if people know where you are at, you will be arrested for trespassing. We have cops here, this is ours. I have cameras all over campus, everywhere.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Kai added that a crowd of people had already gathered at the university, which prompted his team to slow things down.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He also noted that there are undercover police officers working with them too, so they will have a bit more protection if anyone sneaks in and tries to hide.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The streamers do have the run of the Akron campus, including their football stadium, gym, and eating halls.</p>
