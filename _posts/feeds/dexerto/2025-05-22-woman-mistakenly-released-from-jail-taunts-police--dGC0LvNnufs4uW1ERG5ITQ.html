<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A woman who was mistakenly released from jail in Canada has gone viral on TikTok for taunting the police in several videos.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tiktok/">TikTok</a> covering pretty much every corner and niche on the internet, plenty of wild topics and clips have gone <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/viral/">viral</a> over the past few years. And, well, there&#8217;s another now.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Back on April 25, Mackenzie Dawn Hardy was released from Fort Saskatchewan Correctional Centre as she had been awaiting a trial for multiple charges, including stealing cars and fleeing from police. Her release, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://globalnews.ca/news/11184610/released-inmate-tiktok-alberta/">according to Global News CA</a>, came about due to a fake letter that fooled officers into believing she was to be let go.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the weeks since, Hardy has been traveling across Canada, teasing police on her TikTok account <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kenzies.on.the.lamb/video/7505239267501755653">kenzies.on.the.lamb</a> &#8211; with several videos receiving a few hundred thousand views.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-tiktoker-taunts-police-after-early-release" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">TikToker taunts police after early release</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Hardy&#8217;s first video boasted about her release as she posted a news report showing her getting on, and included the caption: &#8220;thats me&#8221; and &#8220;thanks for freeing me piggies.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the videos since, the former inmate has continued to refer to the police as &#8220;piggies,&#8221; and has even conducted interviews with the press. She has confirmed that her whereabouts are &#8220;outside Edmonton,&#8221; but regularly uploads videos from a car.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Apparently, with these videos I&#8217;m making, its going to get me caught,&#8221; she said in one video with over 350,000 views. &#8220;But, you guys have had my back in the comments, telling me to continue running. The cops are just pissed because I&#8217;m one step ahead of them.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As of writing, Hardy is still free, and has turned to crowdfunding from her TikTok followers. She also claimed that it was a &#8220;government mess up&#8221; or &#8220;something that was done in error,&#8221; as she was due to be released within two weeks.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Cpl. Troy Savinkoff, of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, told GlobalNews CA that Hardy&#8217;s arrest is &#8220;an inevitability,&#8221; and it&#8217;ll &#8220;be interesting&#8221; what she says if he gets put back in front of a judge.&#160;</p>
