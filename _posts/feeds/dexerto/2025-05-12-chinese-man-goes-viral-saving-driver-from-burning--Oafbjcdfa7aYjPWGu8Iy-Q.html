<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Sometimes, normal people do extraordinary things. That&#8217;s exactly the case with a man in China&#8217;s Guangdong Province earlier in May when he used his bare hands to rip open a car door and save the driver inside.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3309533/china-hero-rips-open-door-burning-car-saves-injured-driver-moments-blast?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=section">South China Morning Post</a>, on May 1, a car and a petrol-driven tricycle collided. While the car pulled over to the side of the road, the tricycle was ablaze and surrounded by toxic fumes.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">35-year-old Zhong Wei, who witnessed the crash as it happened near his home, tried calling for an ambulance, but when he saw the flames were about to engulf the driver&#8217;s side of the car, he decided to take action.</p>



<h2 id="h-hero-saves-driver-from-burning-car-in-must-see-video" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Hero saves driver from burning car in must-see video</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the footage of the incident, you can see Wei trying to open the door with his bare hands and not have any luck as flames burst out of the vehicle, but he persevered and tried again.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After some pulling, he managed to open the door, which he later said was due to the strength he built up carrying heavy bags of fertilizer at work. After getting to the driver, he was able to drag him to safety from the windscreen that had been smashed during the collision.</p> 



 
 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Eventually, paramedics arrived and took care of the driver, who was able to recover in the hospital.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Video of the encounter has gone viral in China, receiving millions of views, as per SCMP.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking with Guangdong TV, Wei explained that he knew he couldn&#8217;t wait for professionals to arrive and that during the life-saving encounter, his <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tech/modder-transforms-fallout-pip-boy-into-a-compact-smartwatch-2815395/">smartwatch</a> showed that his heart rate reached as high as 151 beats per minute.</p>
