But the grisliest kill scene in Bloodlines not only unlocks a fresh fear, but you won&#8217;t see it coming.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">And that&#8217;s saying something. The first Final Destination had the element of surprise on its side, and so each entry that followed had to out-gross itself in elaborate, ironic, and often darkly funny ways.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;ve seen unwitting victims cooked alive, crushed, impaled, shredded, and disemboweled in ways so intricate they&#8217;d leave <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/saw-x-how-did-cecilia-know-about-jigsaw-and-john-kramer-2322474/">Jigsaw</a> out of a job. Even the later entries satisfied that grisly itch. Who could forget the gymnast folding like origami or the laser eye surgery from hell in Final Destination 5?</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But with <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/final-destination-bloodlines-review-3194517/">Final Destination: Bloodlines</a> arriving 14 years after the previous chapter, it had to do something special. Something horrifying. Something that turns the mundane into a bone-crunching meat grinder. And boy, did it deliver. Warning: <strong>spoilers ahead</strong>!</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The death of Erik Campbell &#8211;&#160;one of lead character Stefani&#8217;s cousins &#8211; is a case of saving the best &#8216;till (nearly) last. The short version is he&#8217;s crumpled and crushed like a sheet of paper, but there&#8217;s far more to it than that.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">You see, in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/final-destination-bloodlines-ending-deaths-explained-3195126/">Final Destination: Bloodlines</a>, Stefani learns about the Campbell family curse, which starts in 1968, when her grandmother Iris has a premonition of a truly gruesome disaster at the Skyview Restaurant Tower.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">She manages to save the attendants, including a young <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/is-tony-todd-in-final-destination-bloodlines-3055057/">William Bludworth (Tony Todd)</a>. But death is not too happy with her interfering with its design. Over the years, it&#8217;s been working its way through the guests&#8217; descendants.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Much of the new <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-horror-movies-all-time-2338495/">horror movie</a> consists of Stefani trying, and failing, to save her blood relatives. Eventually, she meets with William, who tells her there is a way to cheat the system: one of them needs to die and be brought back to life.&#160;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Since Erik finds out he&#8217;s not actually blood related to the Campbells, he decides to enact the plan through his brother Bobby, who&#8217;s deathly allergic to peanuts. They&#8217;ll purposely give him a nut-based product, and then Erik will revive him with an EpiPen.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">And, as they&#8217;re doing this at a hospital, it&#8217;s totally safe&#8230; right? Oh, wait, no, of course it isn&#8217;t. What the brothers don&#8217;t realize is that the room they choose to do this in contains an MRI scanner, which Erik accidentally sets off.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The machine malfunctions, causing it to reach the highest power levels possible. There&#8217;s two horrifying details to this equation: firstly, Erik is covered in body piercings, and secondly, MRIs contain powerful magnets.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s his earrings that go first. But before he can act, his nipple piercings are ripped from his chest, followed by the most excruciating of all&#160;&#8211;&#160;his Prince Albert (a ring on his manhood, for the uninitiated).&#160;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Finally, the magnets suck in the nearby wheelchair, pulling Erik in there with it. He&#8217;s folded in half like a human pretzel (&#224; la <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/in-a-violent-nature-grisliest-scenes-ranked-2759410/">In a Violent Nature</a>), but it&#8217;s the sound design that really makes it &#8211;&#160;metal clanking, bones crunching, and blood squelching combine to make a stomach-churning symphony.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">What makes the death even worse is the cruel irony of it all. Erik wasn&#8217;t even supposed to die according to the chain. He&#8217;s not blood related to Iris, he&#8217;s just an unfortunate soul caught in the crosshairs.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Yes, it&#8217;s unfair, but it makes for a helluva scene, one that proves death is petty, death is creative, and, apparently, death really hates piercings.&#160;</p>
