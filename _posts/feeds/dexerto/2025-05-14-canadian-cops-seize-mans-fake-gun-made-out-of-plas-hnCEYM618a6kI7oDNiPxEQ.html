<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A Canadian man armed with an &#8220;imitation firearm&#8221; made out of a plastic container had his gun seized by police after he allegedly used it to threaten a gas station.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Police in Kingston, Ontario, Canada were called to a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/gas-station-shootout-goes-viral-as-viewers-compare-it-to-john-wick-gta-2096166/">gas station</a> on the morning of Tuesday, May 12 after a man was spotted wielding what was believed to be a white handgun.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.kingstonpolice.ca/news/posts/kingston-police-arrest-individual-with-imitation-firearm/">police</a>, the man aimed the &#8220;gun&#8221; toward the glass at the front of the filling station and various items on the property.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When the cops arrived, the man was gone, but they located him nearby and uncovered the truth about the &#8220;firearm.&#8221;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The police soon determined that the gun was actually made out of a plastic container, such as one used to hold <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/food/">food</a> or a drink.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, upon investigating the 27-year-old, they learned he was bound by a release order and couldn&#8217;t possess any weapons as defined by the Criminal Code, which includes imitation firearms.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As such, the man was arrested, but in the process, he allegedly assaulted an officer by spitting in their face.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He was ultimately charged with harassment by threatening conduct, assaulting a peace officer and failing to comply with the conditions of a release order before being taken to the police headquarters.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This isn&#8217;t the first time a fake gun has gotten someone in trouble. In 2024, a boy in Missouri was suspended from school after making a rifle out of Dr Pepper cans at home and sharing a photo of it on Snapchat.</p>
