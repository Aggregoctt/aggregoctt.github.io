<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">YouTube and TikTok star Eugenia Cooney left fans worried after she began to gag during a live stream and abruptly ended the broadcast.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Eugenia Cooney is a prominent influencer across multiple platforms who specializes in fashion and beauty content.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fans have regularly expressed concerns for Cooney&#8217;s health over the years, with the star suffering from an apparent eating disorder. In 2024, TikTok even <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tiktok/tiktok-is-blocking-users-from-searching-for-eugenia-cooney-amid-health-concerns-2628368/">blocked users from searching for her content</a>, and instead directed them to the National Alliance for Eating Disorders.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In May 2025, Cooney, who has over 4M followers on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tiktok/">TikTok</a> and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/">YouTube</a> combined, once again sparked concerns from fans after suddenly ending her TikTok live broadcast when she claimed to have fallen ill.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">During the broadcast, 30-year-old Cooney suddenly appeared to collapse and began to start gagging. The influencer then told her viewers that she &#8220;wasn&#8217;t feeling that great.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I think I might just get off,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I&#8217;m kinda letting my stress get to me. I&#8217;m gonna get off for now.&#8221;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the time since, two videos have been posted to her TikTok channel, but, as reported by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14742501/YouTube-star-collapses-live-streaming-Eugenia-Cooney-TikTok.html">The Daily Mail</a>, both were pre-recorded &#8211; with one supposedly being filmed a year ago.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fans were very worried about her wellbeing following the livestream incident. &#8220;She genuinely looked so scared before she ended that live,&#8221; one commented.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We all just want to see you get better baby,&#8221; another remarked on a pre-recorded video.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;That stare she was doing when she sat back was so scary and upsetting. I think this is the worst I&#8217;ve seen her,&#8221; another chimed in.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Eugenia&#8217;s friend, fellow influencer Jeffree Star, told viewers that Cooney was &#8220;clearly not ok&#8221; and fans have &#8220;no idea what she&#8217;s going through.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At the time of posting Eugenia hasn&#8217;t responded to fans&#8217; concerns on any platform.</p>
