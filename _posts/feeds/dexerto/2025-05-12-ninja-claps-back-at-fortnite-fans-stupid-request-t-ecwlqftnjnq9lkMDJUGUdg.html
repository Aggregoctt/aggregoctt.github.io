<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Twitch star Tyler &#8216;Ninja&#8217; Blevins clapped back at a viewer who asked him why he avoids Fortnite&#8217;s popular build mode.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over the last few years, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> has undergone some pretty big changes. Building was the one big feature that used to set it apart from the rest, however,<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/fortnite-makes-no-building-mode-permanent-with-zero-build-addition-1793803/"> Epic Games have added Zero Build.&#160;</a></p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That new mode, coupled with the OG map, gave the battle royale a new lease of life. Thousands of players returned to give it another go, and they&#8217;ve stuck around for quite some time.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That includes Ninja, who made it big thanks to the original Fortnite boom. He had swapped games during the lull, but returned with Zero Build and has stuck around pretty much ever since. However, some fans want him to go back to his roots and start cranking out 90s in the build mode again.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-ninja-can&#8217;t-believe-fan-request-to-play-fortnite-build-mode" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Ninja can&#8217;t believe fan request to play Fortnite build mode</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The request for him to go back to the popular build mode came up during his May 11 stream as Blevins clapped back at a viewer&#8217;s question about it.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Imagine being subbed to the channel, your first message, and I don&#8217;t know how he got gifted a sub but he said &#8216;why are you playing Zero Build you bot?&#8217; I&#8217;m a f**king 33-year-old man, married, seven years,&#8221; Ninja said.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Do you understand that? I&#8217;m almost halfway to 40 years old and you&#8217;re asking me why I&#8217;m not playing build mode? Do you know how stupid that sounds? I want you to look in the mirror and think about that question the next time you open your mouth or type something in somebody&#8217;s chat. Really reflect on what you&#8217;re asking, ok?&#8221;</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Twitch star didn&#8217;t finish there, asking the viewer why would he choose to &#8220;sweat&#8221; against &#8220;15 and eight-year-olds&#8221; when he&#8217;s nearly 40.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, if you tune in, just expect to see Zero Build if he is playing Fortnite.</p>
