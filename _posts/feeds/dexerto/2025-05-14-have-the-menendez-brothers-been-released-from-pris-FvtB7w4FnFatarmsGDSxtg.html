title: Have the Menendez Brothers been released from prison? Truth behind new sentencing

<div> 
<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A huge break in the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/how-menendez-brothers-got-caught-arrest-explained-2920547/">Erik and Lyle Menendez</a> case arrived this week when a judge gave the brothers a new sentence for the 1989 killings of their parents, Kitty and Jose. Now, attention has turned to the big question on everyone&#8217;s lips: will they be released from prison?</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Thanks to (or, some may argue, in spite of) Ryan Murphy&#8217;s <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/monsters-the-lyle-and-erik-menendez-story-netflix-ending-explained-2904236/">Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story</a>, renewed focus was placed on the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/true-crime/">true crime</a> case. The brothers were arrested and sentenced to life in prison on parole for murdering their parents at their Beverly Hills home.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, ever since the first trial, Lyle and Erik have argued self-defense, alleging their parents subjected them to a lifetime of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-menendez-brothers-documentary-watch-now-after-calls-for-resentencing-2959202/">New evidence has emerged</a> to corroborate their claims, as well as changing attitudes towards male abuse survivors.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Despite a growing social movement to free the brothers, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/menendez-brothers-erik-lyle-guilty-or-innocent-monsters-netflix-2904735/">legal experts previously told Dexerto</a> that revisiting old cases and altering convictions is rare &#8211; but not impossible. And now, it&#8217;s all changed thanks to a new ruling.</p> 



<h2 id="h-have-the-menendez-brothers-been-released-from-prison?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Have the Menendez Brothers been released from prison?</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>No, Erik and Lyle Menendez haven&#8217;t been released from prison yet. However, they&#8217;re now eligible for parole, </strong>making them one step closer to freedom.&#160;&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 14, 2025, it was announced that Judge Michael Jesic had shortened the brothers&#8217; sentence from life in prison without the possibility of parole to 50 years to life.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Although the Menendezs&#8217; lawyers were previously hoping to have the first-degree murder charge changed to manslaughter, resentencing is the next best thing.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ll definitely be released. But Erik, 54, and Lyle, 57, are eligible for parole. If successful, they&#8217;ll leave prison under provisional release, a form of early release whereby the individual agrees to follow behavioral conditions, including check-ins with their parole officer.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-they&#8217;ve-served-already" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">How long they&#8217;ve served already</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Erik and Lyle Menendez have been in prison for <strong>35 years</strong> now, having been arrested and held in custody since March 1990. They are <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/erik-lyle-menendez-now-monster-season-2-netflix-2902999/">both currently serving their sentences</a> at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego County, California.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">They will remain behind bars while going through the parole process, which is set to get underway soon. But many of those involved believe they&#8217;ve served enough time and demonstrated rehabilitation.&#160;&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As Judge Jesic said at the hearing (via the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/13/menendez-brothers-california-judge">Guardian</a>), &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying they should be released; it&#8217;s not for me to decide. I do believe they&#8217;ve done enough in the past 35 years that they should get that chance.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/menendez-brothers-documentary-netflix-left-out-details-2922964/">The Menendez brothers&#8217; cousin</a>, Anamaria Baralt, added, &#8220;We all, on both sides of the family, believe that 35 years is enough. They are universally forgiven by our family.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Both Erik and Lyle have spent the last 35 years rehabilitating themselves and using their experiences to help other prisoners.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This was expressed in court by former judge Jonathan Colby, who said he was impressed by the brothers&#8217; programs to care for older and disabled inmates. &#8220;There&#8217;s not many prisoners I meet like Erik and Lyle that have such concern for the elderly,&#8221; he explained.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Former prisoner Anerae Brown also shared testimony in court, saying the Menendez brothers helped him lead a new life after his release. &#8220;I have children now. Without Lyle and Erik I might still be sitting in there doing stupid things,&#8221; he said.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-when-they-might-be-released" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">When they might be released</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Technically, they <strong>could be released in 2026, if parole is granted.</strong> Firstly, the parole board will schedule a hearing, which can take anywhere between a few months to a year or more &#8211; although it can take longer in high-profile cases such as the Menendez brothers&#8217;.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After the hearing, the board will either grant, deny, or defer parole. In California, there&#8217;s a review period after the decision is made, which can last up to 120 days. If parole is upheld, release typically happens a few weeks to a couple of months after that.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The reason Erik and Lyle are eligible for parole is thanks to California&#8217;s youth offender law. This allows those who committed their crimes before the age of 26 to receive a parole hearing during their 15th, 20th, or 25th year of incarceration, even if they were sentenced to 50 years to life.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Erik and Lyle were 18 and 21 years old, respectively, when they killed Kitty and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/monsters-lyle-erik-story-jose-menendez-net-worth-2904561/">Jose Menendez</a>, and since they&#8217;ve already served 35 years, they&#8217;ve long met the criteria for a hearing.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Right now there are no definitive answers, but we can expect to hear updates in the months to come.</p>
