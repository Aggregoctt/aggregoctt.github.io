<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In September 2024, WizKids announced D&amp;D Icons of the Realms: Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 Character Boxed Set. The $49.99 miniature set features seven characters from the game, including Karlach, Astarion, Shadowheart, and Gale.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, after waiting months for the release, fans were left disappointed by the overall quality of the figures. Even Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3&#8217;s Senior Cinematic Artist, Elodie Ceselli, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/HighLODLar/status/1922382189263544352">took to X to call out WizKids</a>.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;What I ordered VS what I received,&#8221; wrote the developer. &#8220;Only Gale has a decent face. It&#8217;s expensive for a 5-year-old painting work&#8230; Shame on you @Wizards_DnD.&#8221; The post highlighting the &#8220;melty&#8221; looking figures quickly went viral, with many fans also showcasing how poor the paintwork is.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Well, it seems WizKids also isn&#8217;t happy with the final product and is now issuing full refunds to disappointed fans.</p> 



<h2 id="h-wizkids-apologizes-for-&#8220;missed-mark&#8221;-bg3-miniatures" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">WizKids apologizes for &#8220;missed mark&#8221; BG3 miniatures</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a statement posted on the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://wizkids.com/recent-announcements-2/baldurs-gate-3-character-boxed-set-update/">official WizKids website</a>, the company admitted the BG3 minifigure set was not up to standard.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Unfortunately, we missed the mark on this goal with the D&amp;D Icons of the Realms: Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 Character Boxed Set. If you purchased this set through our online stores, we will be offering a full refund to those who are unsatisfied with their set.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For those who purchased the set via a local retailer, WizKids notes that fans can return the set to the store for a full refund. The company is also investigating the issues to ensure future reprints meet a better standard in the future.&#160;</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Please accept our sincerest apologies for the frustration and disappointment these quality issues caused our customers. We, too, feel the same, as the final product did not meet our expectations or that of our Wizards of the Coast partner,&#8221; said WizKids.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Our teams are working to find the best solutions to resolve this for all involved and to work with you, our customers, to fix this. We appreciate your patience as we focus on getting back to those affected and helping them with their refunds in a timely manner.&#8221;</p>
