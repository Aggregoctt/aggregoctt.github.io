<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Alan Cumming has teased a fight against another Marvel hero in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/avengers-the-kang-dynasty-release-date-cast-plot-more-1949725/">Avengers: Doomsday</a>, fueling the theory that it may secretly be an Avengers vs X-Men movie. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s been a long time coming since Disney acquired 20th Century Fox and all of its superhero assets, but after their brief appearances in Doctor Strange 2 and Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, the X-Men are finally coming to the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/marvel/">MCU</a>. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, before we get any new cast members, the original ensemble will return in Avengers: Doomsday (and possibly <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/avengers-secret-wars-release-date-cast-plot-more-1950442/">Secret Wars</a>). </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s unclear how or why the X-Men will show up in Doomsday, especially alongside the MCU&#8217;s other heroes and the Fantastic Four &#8211; but there may be at least one fight between them. </p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgiOnrGCsWc">BuzzFeed UK</a>, Alan Cumming discussed his return as Nightcrawler in Avengers: Doomsday &#8211; and delivered a big tease. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I&#8217;m playing Nightcrawler again now. I was learning stunts yesterday for the fight, some fight scene, and I just think, &#8216;I&#8217;m 60 years old,'&#8221; he said. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;23 years ago I played that superhero, I was kind of old for a superhero even then, and now I&#8217;m back doing it. That to me is hilarious, so learning these fights, I&#8217;m like, &#8216;What? Who am I fighting with?&#8217; They said, &#8216;You&#8217;re hitting Pedro Pascal against the head,&#8217; or something.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">An emerging theory is that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/is-doomsday-a-secret-avengers-versus-x-men-movie-3171336/">Robert Downey Jr&#8217;s Doctor Doom will pit the Avengers against the X-Men</a>&#8230; and, unfortunately, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/why-the-x-men-will-die-in-avengers-doomsday-3171006/">the X-Men may not survive the events of Doomsday</a>. </p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to an anonymous source (via <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://quidvacuo.cineverso.es/p/avengers-vs-mutantes-el-conflicto-que-marcar-el-futuro-del-mcu-toma-forma-en-doomsday-52f0c9454726d3">QuidVacao</a>, so take it with a large grain of salt), Doom may &#8220;orchestrate the conflict between Avengers and Mutants as part of a more ambitious plan.&#8221;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Doom would use the Avengers as a tool to confront the Mutants in order to weaken both factions. His ultimate goal would be to gain access to a power source capable of&#160;reviving his own destroyed universe&#160;, thus introducing a tragic and personal subtext to a villain who, in this version, could fuse elements of both Tony Stark and classic Doom,&#8221; the outlet added. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Given that Secret Wars is believed to be an adaptation of 2015&#8217;s Secret Wars comic, this would make sense, but it remains to be seen if it&#8217;s true. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Russo Brothers have kept their cards close to their chests regarding Doomsday, but in an interview with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://comicbook.com/movies/news/russo-brothers-avengers-doomsday-secret-wars-mcu-focused-narrative-comments/">Comic Book</a>, they expressed wishes to make it feel more &#8220;focused&#8221; than the Multiverse Saga has been since Endgame.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Yes, the MCU has got quite large, that&#8217;s for sure. I mean, frankly, we struggle with that same issue, but part of the reason Joe and I decided to go back is exactly what you&#8217;re talking about,&#8221; Anthony Russo said.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;There needs to be more of a central narrative. That was something we were very specific about when we worked with Marvel [before]. We would like to bring the focused narrative back.&#8221;</p>
