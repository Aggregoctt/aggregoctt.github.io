<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Adin Ross has claimed that KICK will overtake Twitch as the go-to platform for livestreaming if the Amazon-owned platform ditches its free Prime subscriptions.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over the years, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/">Twitch</a> has had a number of challengers try to dethrone it as the go-to platform for livestreamers. The likes of YouTube, Facebook Gaming, Mixer, and DLive have all thrown big money at content creators in the hopes of taking over from Twitch.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As it stands, the Amazon-owned platform is still the go-to site, but it has come under fierce competition from KICK in the last two years.<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/what-is-kick-twitch-new-streaming-rival-2003508/"> The Stake-backed platform </a>has not only thrown big money at some of the top streamers around, but also followed Twitch&#8217;s formula for the site&#8217;s layout, and been a bit more relaxed with rules.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If Twitch were to stumble, KICK is the site that is most positioned to take over. And, according to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/adin-ross/">Adin Ross</a>, it is only a matter of time before the Amazon-owned platform allows them to do just that.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-adin-ross-claims-twitch-will-ditch-prime-subs-soon" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Adin Ross claims Twitch will ditch Prime Subs soon</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The KICK co-owner, who was recently unbanned by Twitch, believes that they will do away with Twitch Prime subscriptions. That would allow the green platform to capitalize, he believes.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I think when Twitch takes away their Amazon Prime, their Twitch Prime, for example, KICK will automatically take over, organically, without even signing big deals,&#8221; he said during episode 456 of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZzNg2Dntdo&amp;ab_channel=IMPAULSIVE">ImPaulsive</a>.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Once Twitch takes away Amazon Prime subscriptions, which is a free subscription, I mean, dude, the sub drop will be 80% down from Twitch.&#8221;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Amazon ditching the Twitch Prime sub is something rival platforms has been harping on about for some time.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/twitch-insiders-fear-mass-layoffs-as-amazon-loses-billions-on-zombie-brand-2844252/">Twitch reportedly loses money despite $2 billion in revenue</a> and has been described as a &#8220;zombie brand&#8221; by Amazon insiders.&#160;</p>
