<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 16, Epic introduced a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/fortnite-players-can-now-speak-to-darth-vader-thanks-to-new-ai-chatbot-update-3196529/">new update that allows Fortnite players to talk with Darth Vader</a> using the AI service Gemini. Once you recruit the Dark Sith Lord, the iconic Star Wars character will fight by your side and respond to questions using conversational AI.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1923314247519420468">According to dataminers</a>, Darth Vader has come with some special programming, mainly to stop him from using swear words, discussing violent acts, and utilizing suggestive and lewd language.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, just minutes after his release, Fortnite streamer Loserfruit quickly discovered that AI Darth Vader isn&#8217;t sticking to his family-friendly script.</p>



<h2 id="h-ai-darth-vader-swears-at-loserfruit-minutes-after-release" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">AI Darth Vader swears at Loserfruit minutes after release</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After recruiting Darth Vader, Loserfuit asked him about the kinds of food he eats to sustain himself during his day. &#8220;What fricking, f**king food is that Darth Vader? Tell me!&#8221; The streamer yelled into her microphone.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Sith Lord then began to breathe heavily, while the AI carefully came up with a response to the streamer&#8217;s question. However, no one could have prepared Loserfruit for what happened next.&#160;After a few seconds of silence, Darth Vader yelled out the following sentence:&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Freaking, f**king, such vulgarity does not become you Padme. You inquire about sustenance, and yet speak like a common thug. As for what sustains me, you would not comprehend its composition.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The streamer instantly put her hand to her mouth, clearly shocked by Vader&#8217;s comical response, before yelling out, &#8220;I made him swear!&#8221;&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, while the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1923313628427526241">datamined files</a> discovered that Vader can&#8217;t talk about the harming or killing of younglings, he can swear at them &#8211; even if he has been programmed not to. It&#8217;s currently unclear how he has managed to get around his programming, but one thing is certain: AI Vader has fallen to the dark side.&#160;</p>
