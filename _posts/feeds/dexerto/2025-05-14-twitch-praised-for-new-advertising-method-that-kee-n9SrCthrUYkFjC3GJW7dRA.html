<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Twitch is being praised for its latest test, wherein, a new method of advertising is being experimented with. This new option presents ads in a picture-in-picture format, ensuring the main broadcast is always kept in focus.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Although <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/">Twitch</a> is the dominant force in the streaming industry, the product is certainly always a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/streamers-call-out-twitch-as-discovery-feed-ignores-smaller-creators-3195025/">work in progress</a>. Rival platforms like Kick and YouTube have come a long way in raising the competition.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In some cases, Twitch has been playing catch-up, only just implementing fan-favorite features from other sites such as <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/twitch-is-finally-copying-one-of-youtube-and-kicks-biggest-features-3194259/">Live Rewind, according to reports</a>. Now, we&#8217;ve heard of another new change in the works, and it&#8217;s one that could improve the viewing experience for everyone.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As first shared by reporter <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/zachbussey">Zach Bussey</a>, Twitch is testing out a picture-in-picture advertising method. One that keeps the main broadcast in focus at all times while muting video ads by default. The test has quickly been met with a wave of compliments, many users praising Twitch for the &#8220;huge W.&#8221;</p> 


 


<h2 id="h-twitch-users-heap-praise-on-new-advertising-method" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Twitch users heap praise on new advertising method</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">First seen on Canadian streamer <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.twitch.tv/rottenpapi">RottenPapi</a>&#8217;s May 13 broadcast, viewers got a glimpse at the new test in action. The broadcast automatically shrunk down, placing a smaller secondary video next to the main stream.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s in this smaller section of the screen that video ads are presented, though they are muted by default. Viewers have to manually hover their cursor over to the ad, or touch the side of their mobile screen in order to listen to the video, if they so choose.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s currently no word on when the feature may roll out in full for all streamers. However, with other recent additions slipping through the cracks, it might not be a long wait. TwitchCon Rotterdam is set to get underway on May 31, 2025. It&#8217;s likely here that we&#8217;ll learn of new changes coming to the platform, as is tradition at these events.</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One thing is clear already though, and that&#8217;s the fact fans are loving the look of the new advertising method. Rather than outright taking over the main feed, this picture-in-picture method has largely been praised as a &#8220;W&#8221; alternative.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This actually seems like such a great middle ground for incentivizing streamers to run ads and removing the worry of breaking immersion or interrupting the moment,&#8221; one individual said in response. &#8220;Seems like a solid W.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I actually LOVE this,&#8221; another chimed in.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Much of the praise centered around the fact &#8220;viewers will not be missing anything during an ad,&#8221; as one user put it. With no pause in the action, it&#8217;s being called a &#8220;great way of doing ads.&#8221;</p>
