<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;re so back. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/final-destination-6-details-1942772/">Final Destination: Bloodlines</a> is a strong addition to the franchise (there are grossout kills, aplenty). But what sets it apart is the film&#8217;s self-awareness and its elaboration on the death curse, giving us more answers than we&#8217;ve ever had before.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Final Destination is a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-horror-franchises-ranked-3190287/">horror franchise</a> no one expected to have such staying power. But thanks to creative (and grisly) deaths and the faceless killer concept, the series has carved out its own bloody path in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/horror/">horror</a> history.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The first three movies are undeniable classics. Silly? Sure. Fun? Absolutely. Plus, it left an entire generation terrified of tanning beds and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/final-destination-promotes-bloodlines-in-the-most-triggering-way-possible-3193462/">log trucks</a>. But by the time The Final Destination and Final Destination 5 rolled around, the formula felt stale, relying far too much on 3D gimmicks and CG-heavy deaths.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Enter Final Destination: Bloodlines. After more than a decade in the grave, the franchise returns with a gruesome, self-aware revival that knows exactly what it is &#8211; and doesn&#8217;t pretend to be anything more.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-what-is-final-destination:-bloodlines-about?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">What is Final Destination: Bloodlines about?</h2>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Directed by Freaks duo Zach Lipovsky and Adam Stein &#8211; and written by <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/scream-6-review-youll-be-screaming-with-delight-2079988/">Scream 6&#8217;s</a> Guy Busick and Cellar Door&#8217;s Lori Evans Taylor &#8211; Bloodlines focuses on Stefani (Kaitlyn Santa Juana), a college student plagued by a recurring nightmare involving a 1960s sky-high restaurant disaster.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When she digs into her family&#8217;s history, she discovers a chilling connection to the survivors of a near-death event that should have never been avoided. Without spoiling anything, the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/new-movies-this-month-2504960/">new movie</a> ties directly into the franchise&#8217;s mythology in a way that finally explains the origins of the death vision curse &#8211; and yes, it actually makes sense.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s a great sense of payoff here for long-time fans, giving weight to past entries and making Bloodlines feel like a worthy follow-up rather than a simple cash grab.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ultimately, it does what every good legacy sequel should: honor what came before, refine the formula, and answer some long-asked questions without overexplaining the mystery.</p> 



<h2 id="h-the-kills-are-back-and-they&#8217;re-nastier-than-ever" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">The kills are back and they&#8217;re nastier than ever</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Let&#8217;s be honest: people don&#8217;t go to Final Destination for deep character development or biting social commentary. They come for the kills, and Bloodlines delivers them in spades.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">From eye-watering piercing mishaps to a grim Gerald&#8217;s Game-esque callback, this is some of the most creative and stomach-turning carnage the series has ever produced &#8211; including the opening vision (which we won&#8217;t spoil here).&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Bloodlines continues to follow in its predecessors&#8217; footsteps by taking its time winding up each death, making you second-guess every falling object, gust of wind, and empty beer bottle. That Rube Goldberg-style chain of events remains the franchise&#8217;s greatest strength, and this entry embraces it fully.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Its greatest weakness is, unsurprisingly, the heavy use of CGI. With indie horror hits like <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/terrifier/">Terrifier</a> and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/in-a-violent-nature-grisliest-scenes-ranked-2759410/">In a Violent Nature</a> sparking renewed love for practical effects, some may grow weary of the digital, physics-defying sequences.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But let&#8217;s be real &#8211; with catastrophes this elaborate, it&#8217;d be near impossible to pull them all off without CGI assistance. As is the case with <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/every-final-destination-movie-available-on-streaming-before-bloodlines-3054987/">all Final Destination movies</a>, it&#8217;s best to embrace the absurdity if you want to have a fun time.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-a-familiar-style" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">A familiar style</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Visually, Bloodlines is clean and contemporary, but very much in line with the franchise&#8217;s signature style. There&#8217;s no shaky-cam horror here &#8211; just crisp, focused direction.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Lipovsky and Stein know how to bring dread, varying between overhead death&#8217;s-eye-view shots and close-ups that tease the horror that&#8217;s about to ensue.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Tonally, there&#8217;s a strong balance between the dark and light. Some of you may wish for a more sinister tone, but Final Destination has never been a gloomy franchise.&#160;&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Busick and Taylor demonstrate their awareness of this through the script, which packs plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor between the more serious moments. This does mean some of the deeper themes fall flat, especially when there are so many new characters.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Various family dynamics and the topic of grief are given time to play out, but they never quite hit the emotional impact they may be aiming for. Still, the film&#8217;s heart is clearly in the right place.</p> 



<h2 id="h-tony-todd-shines-one-last-time" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Tony Todd shines one last time</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The performances are solid and consistent. Juana may not be the most memorable protagonist the franchise has seen, but she does well for a relative newcomer. The supporting cast similarly play their roles straight enough for the horror to land.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One exception is Richard Harmon, who steals every scene he&#8217;s in as Erik Campbell, one of Stefani&#8217;s cousins. Charismatic, sharp-tongued, and always a little too calm under pressure, he&#8217;s easily one of the film&#8217;s most watchable characters.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Then there&#8217;s <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/is-tony-todd-in-final-destination-bloodlines-3055057/">Tony Todd</a>. Returning once more as the enigmatic William Bludworth (in his final role before his real-life death in 2024), his presence is a genuine highlight.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Without giving too much away, Bloodlines offers a fitting send-off for the franchise&#8217;s most iconic character, tying into the lore of Final Destination&#8217;s origins. Seeing him is a gut punch in the best possible way.</p>



<h2 id="h-not-perfect-but-a-damn-good-time" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Not perfect but a damn good time</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While the backstory makes Bloodlines a welcome extension, there are still plenty of questions left unanswered should a Final Destination 7 get the green light.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Among the downsides, seasoned horror fans will likely see some of the twists coming from a mile away. The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-new-movies-to-stream-this-month-2557037/">new movie</a> also leans pretty heavily on fan service, meaning its ties to the past may not land in the same way for newcomers.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, there&#8217;s more than enough here to keep you entertained.&#160; And yes, it&#8217;ll leave you terrified of everyday situations once more&#8230; you didn&#8217;t have any BBQs planned this summer, right?</p> 



<h2 id="h-verdict" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Verdict</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Final Destination: Bloodlines is the best the franchise has been in almost 20 years. Creative kills, smart callbacks, and a surprisingly poignant farewell to an iconic character make this a worthy revival. It doesn&#8217;t reinvent the franchise, it sharpens it. And honestly? That&#8217;s exactly what we needed.</p>
