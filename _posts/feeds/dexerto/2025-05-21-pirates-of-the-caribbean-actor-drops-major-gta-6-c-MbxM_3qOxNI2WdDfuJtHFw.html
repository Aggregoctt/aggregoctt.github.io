<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A Spanish actor from Pirates of the Caribbean and Rambo: Last Blood has appeared to confirm his involvement in GTA 6 after a cryptic deleted post.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ever since GTA 6 was first announced, players have been trying to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-fans-are-convinced-they-recognize-jasons-voice-actor-3190600/">figure out the game&#8217;s actors</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While no one has been confirmed just yet, in May, Rockstar revealed the second <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-rumors-story-and-more-for-the-next-grand-theft-auto-game-245713/">GTA 6</a> trailer, along with some huge info about VI and new <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-screenshot-reveals-return-of-controversial-manhunt-character-3196847/">screenshots</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The game&#8217;s <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">website</a> confirmed several new characters alongside protagonists Jason and Lucia. And although we still don&#8217;t know for sure who is playing those two, a deleted Instagram post may have revealed the identity of an important co-star.</p> 



<h2 id="h-raul-bautista&#8217;s-gta-6-actor-may-have-just-been-confirmed" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Raul Bautista&#8217;s GTA 6 actor may have just been confirmed</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One of GTA 6&#8217;s big characters will be Raul Bautista, a seasoned bank robber.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Bautista&#8217;s section on Rockstar&#8217;s website includes a screenshot of him engaging in a Heat-like police shootout alongside Jason and Lucia.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Bautista could very well end up being one of VI&#8217;s antagonists, as his bio description states: &#8220;Raul&#8217;s recklessness raises the stakes with every score. Sooner or later, his crew will have to double down or pull their chips from the table.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Well, on May 20, Spanish actor <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.instagram.com/ojaenada/">Oscar Jaenada</a> from movies such as Che, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, The Shallows, and Rambo: Last Blood made a very interesting Instagram post.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As noted by GameRoll on X, a user who had previously <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/leaker-proven-correct-about-gta-6-reveals-more-about-the-games-development-3194398/">leaked information about VI</a>, Jaenada posted a shirt with Raul&#8217;s face on it to his now-deleted Instagram story.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s him. Pretty insane to be posting that under a Rockstar NDA lol,&#8221; GameRoll remarked.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Jaenada&#8217;s look definitely matches that of Bautista. While this may not be a full confirmation, the post certainly raises quite a lot of speculation with many users now convinced that he&#8217;s in GTA 6.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Pretty hard to argue with that one if he posted that,&#8221; one user said.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely him! This was probably intentional, or he didn&#8217;t understand how the GTA community works and didn&#8217;t take Rockstar&#8217;s advice seriously,&#8221; another chimed in.</p> 



   



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;IT&#8217;S THE SPANIARD FROM POTC4, JASON AND LUCIA ARE COOKED,&#8221; someone else claimed.</p>
