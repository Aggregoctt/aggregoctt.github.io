<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Max, the streaming platform owned by Warner Bros, is changing its name (back) to&#8230; HBO Max. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Max launched in the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-streaming-services-2641341/">streaming service</a> boom of the early 2020s, with hopes of exclusively hosting Warner Bros and HBO&#8217;s library of movies and TV shows and competing against the likes of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> and Prime Video. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It was originally called HBO Max, as it succeeded both HBO Now and HBO Go. Three years later, following WarnerMedia&#8217;s merger with Discovery, it was officially rebranded as Max in an effort to be &#8220;welcoming to all and easily recognizable, including to&#8230; kids and families.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now, Warner Bros&#8217; CEO David Zaslav has announced that the platform is changing its name again &#8211; only this time, it&#8217;s going back to HBO Max. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-max-is-going-back-to-hbo-max" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Why Max is going back to HBO Max</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Max is being renamed HBO Max for a simple reason: HBO represents quality, prestige programming, and Warner Bros believes it&#8217;s a more appropriate selling point for its customers. In other words, if someone sees &#8220;HBO&#8221;, they&#8217;re more likely to sign up. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After all, HBO is responsible for <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/house-of-the-dragon/">House of the Dragon</a>, Succession, and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/the-last-of-us/">The Last of Us</a>. That&#8217;s not to say there haven&#8217;t been any good Max originals (Peacemaker and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-pitt-season-2-3178540/">The Pitt</a> are standouts), but the streamer hasn&#8217;t made the same cultural splash as its more esteemed broadcasting arm.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The powerful growth we have seen in our global streaming service is built around the quality of our programming,&#8221; Zaslav explained at the company&#8217;s upfront presentation (via <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/max-name-change-hbo-max-upfronts-1236216616/">THR</a>). </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Today, we are bringing back HBO, the brand that represents the highest quality in media, to further accelerate that growth in the years ahead.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Casey Bloys, CEO of HBO and Max content, added: &#8220;With the course we are on and strong momentum we are enjoying, we believe HBO Max far better represents our current consumer proposition. And it clearly states our implicit promise to deliver content that is recognized as unique and, to steal a line we always said at HBO, worth paying for.&#8221;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a further statement, WarnerMedia said the decision was &#8220;influenced by changing consumer needs, and the fact that no consumer today is saying they want more content, but most consumers are saying they want better content.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;With other services filling the more basic needs with volume, WBD has clearly distinguished itself through its quality and distinct stories, and no brand has done that better and more consistently over 50+ years than HBO,&#8221; it continued.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Returning the HBO brand into HBO Max will further drive the service forward and amplify the uniqueness that subscribers can expect from the offering. It is also a testament to WBD&#8217;s willingness to keep boldly iterating its strategy and approach &#8211; leaning heavily on consumer data and insights &#8211; to best position itself for success.&#8221;</p>
