<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Square Enix, the team behind <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/final-fantasy/">Final Fantasy</a>, has announced a collaboration with TBS, the Japanese TV company that created Takeshi&#8217;s Castle and Ninja Warrior, to make a brand new original game.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Most people will know Square Enix at this point. They&#8217;re the developers and publishers of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-2531964/">Final Fantasy</a>, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/nier-automata-director-thinks-game-devs-will-lose-their-jobs-to-ai-3186657/">NieR: Automata</a>, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/kingdom-hearts/">Kingdom Hearts</a>, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-2965173/">Life is Strange</a>, and so much more. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, not too many will know TBS, otherwise known as the Tokyo Broadcasting System. This TV company is best known for its production of chaotic game shows like Takeshi&#8217;s Castle and Ninja Warrior, and they&#8217;re collaborating with Square Enix to make a game.</p> 



<h2 id="h-square-enix-to-make-original-game-with-tbs" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Square Enix to make original game with TBS</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While not too much is known about what the game will entail, the news was revealed in a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/company/ja/news/files/077cbfa987cc7f8ee0eac7391eedb651.pdf">press release</a> in which (translated to English) the companies detailed that &#8220;Square Enix co., Ltd and TBS Television Co., Ltd are pleased to announced their collaboration in the game development of a completely new original IP.&#8221;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Naturally, this means it won&#8217;t be any Final Fantasy or Kingdom Hearts, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/screentime/status/1922552804217925976">despite the cancellation of the mobile game, Kingdom Hearts Missing Link</a>, and the promise that Kingdom Hearts 4 is still in development. However, what this IP will end up being is entirely speculation.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Based on the classic Square Enix style and collaboration with a TV company, it&#8217;s likely we&#8217;ll see some extremely thought-out storylines and cinematics, but its setting, gameplay, or even genre is yet to be revealed.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Luckily, as highlighted in the press release (again, translated to English), the new game will be &#8220;a completely new original IP game for both Japan and overseas,&#8221; so fans across the world will be able to enjoy the upcoming adventure, as opposed to it purely being released in Japan.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Here&#8217;s hoping it&#8217;s as chaotic and enjoyable as Ninja Warrior and Takeshi&#8217;s Castle, only maybe not as tough as those are to win.</p>
