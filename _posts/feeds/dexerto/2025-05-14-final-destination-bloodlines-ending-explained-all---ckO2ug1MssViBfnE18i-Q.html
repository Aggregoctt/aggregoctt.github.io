<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For the uninitiated, the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/every-final-destination-movie-available-on-streaming-before-bloodlines-3054987/">Final Destination movies</a> are all about cheating death. The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-horror-franchises-ranked-3190287/">horror franchise</a> follows a prescribed formula: the protagonist will have a vision of a horrifying mass casualty event and manage to save a handful of unlucky souls by freaking out just in time.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But death doesn&#8217;t like being skipped. One by one, the survivors are hunted down by an invisible force, getting killed in the most elaborate, Rube Goldberg-esque ways imaginable. Bloodlines, which arrived in UK cinemas on May 14 &#8211;&#160;14 years after the last film &#8211;&#160;follows a similar premise.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/new-movies-this-month-2504960/">new movie</a> also shakes things up. This time, college student Stefani has a premonition of a deadly accident avoided by her grandma decades before, linking their fates with previous events. Warning: <strong>spoilers ahead</strong>!</p> 



<h2 id="h-final-destination:-bloodlines-ending-explained" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Final Destination: Bloodlines ending explained</h2>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the final scene, Stefani and her brother Charlie celebrate his graduation, believing they&#8217;ve cheated death. However, they find out that their ploy didn&#8217;t work due to a technicality. By this point, it&#8217;s too late &#8211; a massive train derails and runs onto their street, killing them both.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Prior to this, Stefani learns that her grandmother Iris had the first premonition in 1968, witnessing a deadly opening night at the Skyview Restaurant Tower. She managed to save everyone from death&#8217;s design &#8211;&#160;including a young <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/is-tony-todd-in-final-destination-bloodlines-3055057/">William Bludworth (Tony Todd)</a>.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But as we know, death doesn&#8217;t let things slide. Instead, it started picking off the survivors &#8211; and eventually, their descendants &#8211; one by one, viewing their continued existence as a cosmic glitch.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over the years, Iris tried to outsmart death by documenting every omen and pattern she noticed. She put all of her findings into a book, using it to prolong her family&#8217;s lives.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The issue is, no one believed her. Living in fear messed up Iris&#8217; daughter Darlene (Stefani and Charlie&#8217;s mother) and her son Howard. As such, when Stefani asks her family for Iris&#8217; contact details, they&#8217;re reluctant to give them to her.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With a little help from Howard&#8217;s wife Brenda, she is able to find her grandmother locked away in a maximum-security cabin in the woods. Iris tries teaching Stefani about death&#8217;s design, and when she doesn&#8217;t believe her, she decides to show her instead.&#160;</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Iris steps outside of the house and death wastes no time in killing her off&#160;&#8211; a chain reaction leads to her being impaled through the mouth, right in front of Stefani.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The rest of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/final-destination-6-details-1942772/">Final Destination: Bloodlines</a> involves Stefani trying to save her living biological family from suffering the same fate. Eventually, Stefani, Charlie, and their cousins meet up with the William Bludworth after discovering his link to the curse. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He tells them that there&#8217;s only two ways to cheat death: either killing someone else or dying and being brought back to life. Since they don&#8217;t want to go around murdering an innocent person, they decide their best bet is to bring one of their own back from the dead.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A lot of chaos ensues as they attempt to enact the plan &#8211; including plenty of deaths &#8211; which culminates in Stefani, Charlie, and their mother Darlene heading to Iris&#8217; cabin. While there, another catastrophic chain of events unfolds, with Stefani ending up trapped in their RV underwater.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Darlene saves Charlie and urges him to help Stefani, sacrificing herself in the process (she&#8217;s killed by a falling lamp post). Charlie is able to cut Stefani&#8217;s seatbelt, but by the time he takes her out of the water, she&#8217;s unconscious.&#160;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He performs CPR and is able to save her, seemingly bringing her back to life and therefore breaking death&#8217;s curse. But at the very end of Final Destination: Bloodlines, they learn a horrifying truth.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After a series of sinister clues, Charlie introduces Stefani to his girlfriend Jenny&#8217;s father, a doctor. She sings her brother&#8217;s praises, saying, &#8220;He brought me back from the dead.&#8221; But the father points out, &#8220;Well, technically you weren&#8217;t dead. I mean, if you were unconscious and Charlie got you breathing again then your heart didn&#8217;t stop&#8230; regardless, way to go Charlie.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Charlie and Stefani realize they were wrong &#8211;&#160;they didn&#8217;t stop death after all. Moments later, a train derails, breaking out onto their street and causing a trail of destruction. As a callback to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/final-destination-promotes-bloodlines-in-the-most-triggering-way-possible-3193462/">Final Destination 2</a>, the siblings are killed by logs that break free from the train&#8217;s cargo.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-who-dies-in-bloodlines?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Who dies in Bloodlines?</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There are <strong>eight deaths in Final Destination: Bloodlines</strong>, including Stefani and Charlie right at the end. This obviously isn&#8217;t counting the Skyview Restaurant Tower disaster premonition at the start. So, the kills shown on screen are:&#160;</p> 



<ul class="pl-10 mt-1 overflow-y-hidden font-body text-body-1 text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white dark:text-body-1 dark:font-body mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text List_list___uTwY wp-block-list">
<li>Iris</li>



<li>Howard</li>



<li>Julia</li>



<li>Erik</li>



<li>Bobby</li>



<li>Darlene</li>



<li>Charlie</li>



<li>Stefani</li>
</ul>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Due to the bloodline curse, only the Campbell family are targeted &#8211; except for Erik, who gets caught in the crossfire. You see, he&#8217;s Bobby&#8217;s brother and the son of Howard (Iris&#8217; son) and Brenda.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As such, earlier on in the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-horror-movies-all-time-2338495/">horror movie</a>, Stefani believes Erik is the next target. And in a particularly grisly scene, his nose piercing gets stuck on a chain, which itself gets stuck on a ceiling fan. He gets dragged up by his nose and spun around as a fire breaks out at his place of work: a tattoo parlor.&#160;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, he survives the incident. When relaying this information to his family, Brenda reveals a family secret &#8211;&#160;he&#8217;s not the biological son of Howard after all, and instead the result of a previous relationship.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This spares him from the curse&#8230; until later. But first, let&#8217;s talk about Howard&#8217;s death. You may have seen this teased in the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/final-destination-bloodlines-trailer-easter-eggs-3169444/">Final Destination: Bloodlines trailer</a>. After a chain reaction kicks off at a family barbecue, poor Howard steps on a stray shard of glass and falls to the floor.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A nearby lawn mower is activated and heads straight for him, shredding his face and killing him. Then there&#8217;s his daughter Julia, who is hit in the head by a football, pushing her into a trash can.&#160;This is lifted by a rubbish removal truck, chucking Julia in the back where she gets crushed to death.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Now, for Erik and Bobby. After learning about Bludworth&#8217;s cheat sheet, they decide the best way to carry out the plan is to give Bobby some peanuts, to which he&#8217;s deathly allergic.&#160;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This takes place at a hospital, so all they have to do is wait for him to die temporarily and then revive him with an adrenaline shot. However, death is one step ahead of them.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While enacting their plan, they accidentally lock themselves in an MRI room and activate the machine, which continues to rise without them noticing. For the uninitiated, MRI scanners contain powerful magnets, hence why you need to remove any jewelry before entering the room &#8211;&#160;and anyone with metal in their bodies can&#8217;t use them.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Soon enough, the machine rips Erik&#8217;s piercings from his body &#8211;&#160;including one on his nether regions &#8211;&#160;before sucking in the wheelchair behind him, crushing Erik to death. Finally, a metal spring from a nearby vending machine flies through, killing Bobby.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-a-final-destination-7?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Will there be a Final Destination 7?</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Warner Bros. has yet to give Final Destination 7 the green light, but that&#8217;s not to say it can&#8217;t happen. Thanks to the Bloodlines ending, the death curse&#8217;s diary is wide open, meaning the story could very well continue.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A lot of this decision will be based on box office performance. Although the budget hasn&#8217;t been revealed, reports estimate it to be around the $40 million mark, in which case it&#8217;ll need to make around $100 million at the box office to be considered a success.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This is due to movies generally needing to make approximately 2.5 times their original budget to break even due to the additional costs such as fees to exhibitors, merchandising, and taxes.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The margin might not be quite as tight for a film of this kind compared to, say, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/marvel-cinematic-universe-movies-ranked-2623206/">MCU movies</a>, which tend to spend more on marketing.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Opening weekend box office predictions vary, but <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.boxofficepro.com/long-range-forecast-what-does-fate-have-in-store-for-final-destination-bloodlines/">Box Office Pro</a> puts its domestic estimations between $35 million and $50 million, boosted by its IMAX release and positive reviews (it&#8217;s received a 92% Rotten Tomatoes score at the time of writing).&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For now, we&#8217;ll just have to wait and see how it performs, and whether this means fate has a Final Destination 7 in store for our future.&#160;</p>
