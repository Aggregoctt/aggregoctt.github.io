<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/cbs-show-renewals-2025-2026-ghosts-georgie-mandy-fire-country-3139837/">CBS</a> spinoff began by reintroducing Mary, Meemaw, and Missy to the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/tv-shows-to-watch-this-month-streaming-2559500/">new TV show</a>, shortly followed by other Medford members including Pastor Jeff, Coach Wilkins, and Sheryl Hutchins. Even <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/georgie-and-mandys-first-marriage-george-return-mistake-3052146/">George made a return</a> from the grave, fleeting seen in zombified form in one of Georgie&#8217;s dreams. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With the McAllister residence in the same town &#8211; and no signs of Georgie and Mandy moving out anytime soon &#8211; it makes sense that more familiar faces will be coming out of the woodwork.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For Georgie star Montana Jordan, there&#8217;s only clear frontrunner for who, if anyone, should return for Georgie &amp; Mandy&#8217;s First Marriage Season 2&#8230; aside from <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/will-sheldon-be-in-the-georgie-mandy-spinoff-2691293/">Sheldon</a> (that&#8217;s a whole separate issue). </p>



<h2 id="h-young-sheldon-star-wants-reba-mcentire-return-in-georgie-&amp;-mandy" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Young Sheldon star wants Reba McEntire return in Georgie &amp; Mandy</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking to Dexerto, Jordan claimed he&#8217;d like to see <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/is-reba-mcentire-in-young-sheldon-2556974/">Reba McEntire</a> &#8211; who guest-starred as June in Young Sheldon &#8211; back for new episodes of the spinoff. </p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"> &#8220;If you ever talk to Reba McEntire, you tell her to come on back to Georgia and Mandy. That&#8217;s who we need back,&#8221; he explained.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It&#8217;s always great to have anyone come back, whenever they&#8217;re able to,&#8221; he added. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">June is introduced in the episode &#8216;A Boyfriend&#8217;s Ex-Wife and a Good Luck Head Rub,&#8217; where Meemaw meets her at one of Missy&#8217;s baseball games. Through stilted conversation, the pair work out that each has a romantic connection to Dale, with Meemaw currently dating him. From there, the pair become fast friends &#8211; but it doesn&#8217;t mean that this is Reba&#8217;s only connection to Young Sheldon.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Brenda, the Cooper family&#8217;s troublesome neighbor played by Melissa Peterman, is also a former co-star of McEntire&#8217;s, with the pair both appearing on Reba&#8217;s self-titled 2001 sitcom. Peterman has also yet to be seen in Georgie &amp; Mandy&#8217;s First Marriage, despite behind-the-scenes set photos. </p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking to TV Line on why the duo have never shared a scene in Young Sheldon, executive producer Steve Holland <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://tvline.com/interviews/reba-mcentire-melissa-peterman-young-sheldon-reunion-season-6-1234871829/">said</a>: &#8220;They&#8217;ve never shared a scene, I know! It&#8217;s a thing that Melissa reminds us of often. She would love to be in scenes with Reba. Part of the reason Reba&#8217;s on the show is because she and Melissa are close friends, and Melissa let us know that Reba was a fan.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Young Sheldon also helped Reba McEntire to cement her relationship with partner Rex Linn &#8211; who plays Principal Petersen &#8211; according to an <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaYDENYiXMA&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vulture.com%2F&amp;source_ve_path=MzY4NDIsMjg2NjY&amp;feature=emb_logo">interview</a> with Andy Cohen. &#8220;Throughout the years, we just stayed in contact,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;Till 2020, before the pandemic, we were both on Young Sheldon. We went out to dinner, and we&#8217;ve been inseparable ever since.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Peterson has also not been seen in the spinoff.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Everybody is so close and so loving. No matter where we&#8217;re at, it always feels like a family,&#8221; Jordan continued. &#8220;It&#8217;s always great when they come visit us on our set. They had to create a Cooper house on Georgie and Mandy set, and it&#8217;s incredible how they can make it look exactly the same.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It&#8217;s like we never left Young Sheldon, it&#8217;s pretty incredible. Anytime that we get to have them back on the show, we love it.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Georgie &amp; Mandy&#8217;s First Marriage Season 2 is expected to premiere this fall.
