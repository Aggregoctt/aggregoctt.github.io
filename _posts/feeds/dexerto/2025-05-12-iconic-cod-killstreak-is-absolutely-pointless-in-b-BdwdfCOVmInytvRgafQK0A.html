<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One of the most iconic killstreaks in Call of Duty history is &#8220;absolutely pointless&#8221; in Black Ops 6, and you actually put yourself at a &#8220;disadvantage&#8221; by using it.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There have been plenty of big changes to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/">Call of Duty </a>and its multiplayer in the last few years. That has included tweaks to Create-A-Class, weapon tuning, and a few other things. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/black-ops-6/">Black Ops 6</a> brought omnimovement to the mix, but it has still tried to reuse some of the classic things fans love.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A lot of those have mainly come in the form of classic maps, perks, and killstreaks, but Treyarch has even tweaked them.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fans have complained about the changes to the Care Package killstreak, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-fans-blast-killstreak-change-making-fan-favorite-unusable-3014655/">claiming it is &#8220;unusable&#8221; now because of how quickly teammates can capture them too</a>. However, it isn&#8217;t the only killstreak that is labelled as useless by players.</p>



<h2 id="h-death-machine-is-&#8220;pointless&#8221;-in-black-ops-6" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Death Machine is &#8220;pointless&#8221; in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Death Machine, which was<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-season-3-update-3144783/"> added to Black Ops 6 during Season 3</a>, has also been called &#8220;absolutely useless&#8221; by some fans.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Your movement speed is slowed down by more than half and there&#8217;s about 500ms of fire delay, and it still takes about 3 bullets to kill,&#8221; Redditor s0und7 <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1kkanwz/the_minigun_killstreak_is_absolutely_pointless/">said</a>. &#8220;By equipping the Minigun, i am putting myself at a disadvantage compared to just running a normal assault rife, which does the same thing but better.&#8221;<br><br>Others agreed too. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t gotten this in multiplayer but I got it as a support in zombies and it was pretty horrid. It makes you so freaking slow it&#8217;s debatably more of a detriment to you than the zombies,&#8221; one added.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It&#8217;s cool and the feel is great but it&#8217;s a little mid,&#8221; another commented. &#8220;It wall bangs pretty good, but that&#8217;s about it lol,&#8221; another chimed in.</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Some fans argued that the killstreak does have its uses, and that is mainly locking down objectives on smaller maps like Nuketown.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It is 100% better than AR LMG Sniper&#8230; at range. &#160; However, there is no reason to summon until I am in position,&#8221; one argued. &#8220;This is def a skill issue bud. You really should have it put away until you&#8217;re in a good position, and then you can pull it out,&#8221; another said.</p>
