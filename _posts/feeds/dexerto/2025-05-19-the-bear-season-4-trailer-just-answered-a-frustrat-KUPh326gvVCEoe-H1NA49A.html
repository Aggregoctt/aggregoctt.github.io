<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Yes, chef! A new trailer for <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-bear-season-4-2800575/">The Bear Season 4</a> has arrived, and it appears to answer the biggest question we had after the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-bear-season-3-recaps-ending-explained-2799510/">Season 3 ending</a>.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/the-bear/">The Bear&#8217;s</a> third chapter proved to be the most divisive yet, with many fans suggesting it should have been marketed as Season 3 Part 1 due to the many questions that were left unanswered.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That frustration has morphed into anticipation for Season 4, which is set to land on FX and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/hulu/">Hulu</a> on June 25, 2025, with all 10 episodes dropping at once.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ahead of its release, a new 30-second trailer has arrived, showing Carmy, Sydney, Richie, and co. in the aftermath of the restaurant&#8217;s opening night &#8211; and that make-or-break review.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-the-review-hangs-over-carmy-in-the-bear-season-4" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">The review hangs over Carmy in The Bear Season 4</h2>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-bear-season-4-footage-reveals-major-sydney-scene-that-could-change-everything-2977861/">The Bear Season 4 trailer</a> confirms that the Chicago Tribune&#8217;s review wasn&#8217;t completely positive.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the clip, Uncle Jimmy and The Computer say, &#8220;Unless everything changes&#8230; this restaurant needs to officially cease operations.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you remember, in Season 3, Carmy and the team discovered that the Chicago Tribune&#8217;s food critic had already written a review for their restaurant &#8211; without anyone realizing they were there.&#160;&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While waiting for the review to come through, Uncle Jimmy gave them an ultimatum: if it&#8217;s bad, he&#8217;ll cut them off financially. No pressure then.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One of the reasons last year&#8217;s chapter received so much criticism is because it ended on a cliffhanger.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Carmy received a Google alert of the review, but rather than show whether it&#8217;s good or bad, we see a flash of ambiguous words ranging from &#8220;excellent&#8221; to &#8220;disappointed.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But this new trailer at least alludes to the idea that it&#8217;s bad. Sugar says, &#8220;Because keeping it open would be like&#8211;,&#8221; with The Computer finishing, &#8220;Beating a dead horse.&#8221;</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Of course, this isn&#8217;t confirmed, but it certainly seems like there were some harsh words. There&#8217;s another little clue in there about The Bear Season 4: Syd and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/how-old-is-carmy-in-the-bear-2801846/">Carmy</a> are still working side-by-side.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In Season 3, Syd secretly met with Ever&#8217;s former CDC, who offered her the main position at his new restaurant. She was still undecided by the finale, but it appears she said no &#8211;&#160;or she&#8217;s still thinking about it.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;ll have to wait for solid answers when the new chapter drops, but until then, it&#8217;s got fans speculating.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;So&#8230; then the review was bad? Ugh, these next few weeks are gonna drive me nuts,&#8221; wrote one on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBear/comments/1kpnm42/new_season_4_commercial/">Reddit</a>.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But another suggested, &#8220;I think the review was probably mixed. Just good enough to attract people in, but also bad enough to point out the flaws in the system.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It seems like Computer and Cicero are saying that they need to fix these flaws, or else the restaurant won&#8217;t work or long-term (working in this current toxic environment with a lack of communication and efficiency is like beating a dead horse).&#8221;</p>
