<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">KFC is back when yet another viral concoction that will surely leave the internet completely baffled.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Do you like ice cream? How about <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/kfc/">KFC</a>&#8217;s iconic gravy? Well, the chicken chain has opted to combine those two delicacies into one wild new item, and it&#8217;s only available for a short time.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The colonel has teamed up with Hackney Gelato to transform its gravy into a sweet frozen treat in the form of Gravy Gelato.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">And it turns out that Hackney needed some convincing before they were able to step up and make good on this collab when Kentucky Fried Chicken first reached out.</p>



<h2 id="h-kfc-is-launching-its-own-gravy-flavored-ice-cream" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">KFC is launching its own gravy-flavored ice cream</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.gbnews.com/lifestyle/food/kfc-new-ice-cream-popular-gravy-gelato">GB News</a>, the company&#8217;s CEO, Tom Lister, was surprised when KFC wanted to team up on this project.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;We&#8217;re no strangers to pushing flavor boundaries, but gravy? This is a first for Hackney Gelato,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;When KFC asked if we could do this, it took some convincing of Enrico and our chefs, but as ever they stepped up and delivered &#8211; we can&#8217;t wait for fans to try this intriguing and savory delight.&#8221;</p> 



 
 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This new flavor will only be available at KFC Shop in the UK starting May 15 at 1PM and will come in 460ml Tubs.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One tub will cost &#163;5.50, around $7.31 USD, and all proceeds will go to the KFC Youth Foundation.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">KFC&#8217;s <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://kfcshop.co.uk/products/gravy-gelato-by-kfc-x-hackney-gelato">website</a> describes the product as an &#8220;unexpected savory delight inspired by KFC&#8217;s legendary gravy&#8221; and includes notes of peppercorn and the company&#8217;s famous fried chicken.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This isn&#8217;t the first time KFC has released a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/viral/">viral</a> product in 2025. On April 1, the chain announced <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/food/kfc-releases-fried-chicken-flavored-toothpaste-and-its-already-sold-out-3180492/">chicken-flavored toothpaste</a>, and it turned out to be a real item and not an April Fool&#8217;s joke. The surprise collab with Australian dental care brand Hismile ended up being a huge hit and sold out in 48 hours.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;ll have to see if this gravy gelato ends up being just as big of a hit, but fans should be warned that once stocks are depleted, KFC says it&#8217;ll be &#8220;gone for good,&#8221; so you&#8217;ll have to act fast.</p>
