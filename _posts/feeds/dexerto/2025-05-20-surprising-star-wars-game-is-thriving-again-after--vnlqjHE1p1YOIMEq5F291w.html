<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Following the conclusion of Andor Season 2, it&#8217;s clear Star Wars fans are hungry for more. Thousands are turning to an older game as the player count of Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2017) soars once again.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Cassian Andor&#8217;s story is now complete as Season 2 of the Rogue One prequel wrapped on Disney+. For many, it&#8217;s not only one of the best bits of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> content ever, but <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/andor-season-2-shatters-rotten-tomatoes-record-star-wars-tv-show-movie-3184083/">among the best television ever created</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As such, viewers are eagerly seeking out more Star Wars material to keep the spark of rebellion alive. One avenue they&#8217;re turning to is video games, though perhaps not the type you&#8217;re expecting.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">EA&#8217;s 2017 release of Star Wars Battlefront 2 is seeing an unexpected resurgence following the show&#8217;s finale. With each passing day, more players are jumping in, to the point it&#8217;s now nearing all-time highs on Steam.</p>



 
 



<h2 id="h-star-wars-battlefront-2-resurges-after-andor-season-2-finale" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Star Wars Battlefront 2 resurges after Andor Season 2 finale</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Battlefront 2, not to be mistaken with the 2005 game sharing the name, has been on a gradual incline since Andor Season 2 began rolling out on Disney+. Now, as of May, 2025, the EA title has recorded its most concurrent players since January, 2021.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Just shy of 8,000 players were engaging with the now eight-year-old game at the same time. It&#8217;s the second biggest spike in players the game has ever seen. At least, that&#8217;s the case on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://steamdb.info/app/1237950/charts/#max">Steam</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s worth bearing in mind the game originally launched on EA&#8217;s own Origin, with the Steam port years behind. This means Steam data wasn&#8217;t accounting for the entire PC player base at launch, which was no doubt far greater than what we see here.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Furthermore, Battlefront 2 leaped ahead on the Xbox charts as well, becoming the 22nd most-played game on the platform, propelling past titles like Halo, Destiny, and Forza.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This is a remarkable surge in activity, especially when considering there hasn&#8217;t been an update from EA in five years.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Within a month of its release back in November, 2017, Battlefront 2 went on to sell nine million copies. That wasn&#8217;t enough for the publisher, however, as <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/30/16952396/star-wars-battlefront-2-sales-loot-boxes-returning">EA declared the game a failure</a>, having missed its sales target of 10 million units in that same window.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At launch, the game was mired in controversy due to its in-game economy and a reliance on loot boxes for character progression. &#8220;The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment,&#8221; an EA spokesperson said at the time, a now-infamous quote in the gaming industry.</p>
