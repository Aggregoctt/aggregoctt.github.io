<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to Forbes journalist Paul Tassi, a longtime Destiny reporter with inside contacts at Bungie, things at the studio are not looking great after news of art being stolen hit the studio.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A relatively small artist who&#8217;s part of the Antireal noticed her art in the Alpha test version of the game, and, after publishing her findings, got a response from Bungie confirming that her art was stolen by a former employee.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This, combined with mixed reception to the Alpha test itself in terms of gameplay, has the company scrambling and fearing that Marathon may flop on release.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As a result, Bungie is reconsidering their strategy entirely and pushing back major game reveals <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/17/new-marathon-info-bungie-morale-launch-worries-and-changing-plans/">according to Tassi&#8217;s reporting</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-bungie-completely-rethinking-marathon-release-strategy" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Bungie completely rethinking Marathon release strategy</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After internal playtests in 2023, Marathon already got delayed once. People who played it back then <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/marathon-reportedly-flopped-amongst-playtesters-amid-bungie-chaos-2364032/">weren&#8217;t sold on it</a>, forcing Bungie to push the game back and create a more engaging gameplay formula.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Around two years later, they got the same response from the early Alpha. Creators didn&#8217;t think the game was bad, but they said it <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/marathon-players-claim-bungie-needs-to-delay-it-as-alpha-disappoints-3187210/">needs a lot more work</a> and more content to really capture audiences and make a dent in the live service market.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This sentiment, combined with the stolen art controversy, has people scrambling internally. According to Tassi&#8217;s sources, &#8220;the vibes have never been worse.&#8221;</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s no date on how long the internal audit of all Bungie&#8217;s assets will be, with their legal team trying to work on sorting things out. They&#8217;ve also pulled planned advertising for the game that was supposed to launch in June according to this report, with the Beta likely getting pushed back as well.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, despite everything, there is no discussion of a delay amongst normal Bungie employees. The company isn&#8217;t even considering it, leaving many concerned at what may happen to the studio if Marathon flops.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Additionally, the report reveals that there were questions about the direction of Marathon from the very beginning, with developers urging top brass to incorporate a PvE component and not make it exclusively a multiplayer game. They were allegedly ignored as the studio went forward with the project regardless.</p>
