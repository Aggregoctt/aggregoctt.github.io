<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Nemik only briefly appeared in Andor, but his manifesto helps turn the character into one of the most influential figures in the Star Wars universe.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In Episode 5 of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/andor/">Andor</a> Season 1, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/andor-episode-5-review-star-wars-writing-has-never-been-this-good-1950065/">Cassian joins up with a team of Rebels</a> who are planning a heist on an Imperial outpost on Aldhani. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One of their number is Karis Nemik (Alex Lawther), an idealist writing a manifesto about the cause of the Rebellion, as well as how the insurrection can ultimately succeed.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He befriends Andor, and tells him about his work in progress. Then, after being mortally wounded, Nemik ensures the manifesto ends up in Cassian&#8217;s hands, a decision that has far-reaching consequences in the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> universe. <strong>SPOILERS</strong> ahead&#8230;</p>



<h2 id="h-why-nemik&#8217;s-manifesto-becomes-so-important-in-andor" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Why Nemik&#8217;s manifesto becomes so important in Andor</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At the end of Andor, the Rebels learn about the existence of the Death Star, and while there are naysayers, we know from the events of Rogue One that the information Luthen got to Cassian precipitates the destruction of the Empire&#8217;s ultimate weapon.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But the Rebellion requires numbers, meaning the galaxy needs to be inspired, and that&#8217;s where Nemik&#8217;s manifesto comes in.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Towards the end of the finale, Partagaz is listening to an audio version of what Nemik also calls &#8216;The Trail of Political Consciousness.&#8217; When Nemik mentions that &#8220;Oppression is the mask of fear,&#8221; Partagaz turns the recording off, and reveals that the manifesto &#8220;just keeps spreading.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It&#8217;s been hard to contain,&#8221; responds Supervisor Lagret, and with that, Partagaz knows he&#8217;s failed, by allowing so powerful a message to escape, and to thrive, within the Rebellion. That information &#8211; combined with knowledge of the punishment heading his way &#8211; inspires Partagaz to take his own life.</p>  



<h2 id="h-nemik&#8217;s-&#8216;trail-of-political-consciousness&#8217;" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Nemik&#8217;s &#8216;Trail of Political Consciousness&#8217;</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Here&#8217;s what Nemik wrote, and the exact words that Partagaz is listening to until he switches off: &#8220;There will be times when the struggle seems impossible. I know this already. Alone, unsure, dwarfed by the scale of the enemy. Remember this &#8211; freedom is a pure idea. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It occurs spontaneously and without instruction. Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies; battalions that have no idea that they&#8217;ve already enlisted in the cause. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Remember that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward. And then remember this. The Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear. Remember that. And know this, the day will come when all these skirmishes and battles, these moments of defiance, will have flooded the banks of the Empire&#8217;s authority, and then there will be one too many. One single thing will break the siege. Remember this. Try.&#8221;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While speaking to StarWars.com about those words at the end of Season 1, Andor showrunner Tony Gilroy <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.starwars.com/news/tony-gilroy-andor-season-1-interview">underlined their importance</a> by revealing &#8220;One of our happiest, proudest things in the show is when [Andor actor] Diego [Luna] is listening back to [Nemik&#8217;s] manifesto.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;He opens Nemik&#8217;s manifesto that night before the funeral. And Nemik is, in the manifesto, saying, &#8216;We&#8217;re going to win because oppression is unnatural, and freedom is a natural [thing].&#8217; And he has a whole big speech about how acts of rebellion are springing up all across the galaxy. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;All the people that are out there trying to make a rebellion, and they&#8217;re all atomized and spread apart. And so the show is really about watching this thing coalesce, and in the end we will coalesce into Yavin.&#8221;</p>
