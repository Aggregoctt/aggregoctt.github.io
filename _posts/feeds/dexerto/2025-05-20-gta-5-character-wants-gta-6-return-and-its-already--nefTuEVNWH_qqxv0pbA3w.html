<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rapper Danny Brown hopes to get the call from Rockstar Games and return in Grand Theft Auto 6 after he appeared in GTA 5.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rockstar Games have always utilized celebrities and famous faces in their Grand Theft Auto series. Ray Liotta, Samuel L Jackson, Phil Collins, Joe Rogan, Axl Rose, and Jason Sudeikis have all appeared in different games, either voicing main characters or cameoing as themselves at some point.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With fans looking forward to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-rumors-story-and-more-for-the-next-grand-theft-auto-game-245713/">GTA 6</a>, they&#8217;ve been speculating for quite some time on who might appear. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-fans-demand-easter-egg-for-iconic-gta-character-2809762/">They&#8217;d love a nod to Liotta&#8217;s iconic character</a> Tommy Vercetti, and<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6-leak-reveals-dj-khaleds-role-big-plans-for-vice-city-radio-stations-3136848/"> DJ Khaled has been reported to host his own radio station</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Detroit rapper Danny Brown hosted his own station in GTA V, and played Yung Ancestor in GTA Online&#8217;s Diamond Casino Heist update. He&#8217;d also love to come back in GTA 6.&#160;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The rapper spoke to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://variety.com/2025/music/news/danny-brown-gta-6-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1236393817/">Variety</a> about his work in video games and his hope to get back in with Rockstar.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I&#8217;ve done a lot of things with GTA. Hopefully they have me back, last time I was a drunk fool,&#8221; Brown said, noting that he is now two years sober and has gone on a journey of recovery following his struggles.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">His return to the game might have already been hinted at by Rockstar. Some fans have noticed a logo resembling Yung Ancestor&#8217;s brand appearing in the screenshots for Boobie Ike, a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/all-confirmed-gta-6-characters-3190548/">new character in GTA 6.</a></p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As noted, he could very easily return as a radio host. That has become a popular way for the GTA developers to get celebrities and musicians into the mix. Frank Ocean was the big one in GTA 5, as an example.</p>
