<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Genshin Impact is set to roll out a new requirement for US players that they need to complete before a certain date to avoid getting a permaban.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Since its release in 2020, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/genshin-impact/">Genshin Impact</a> has been one of the biggest <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/best-upcoming-gacha-games-3009756/">gacha games</a>, alongside titles like Arknights and Honkai Star Rail.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Despite the game&#8217;s popularity and its abundance of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/genshin-impact/genshin-impact-collab-2893310/">real-life collabs</a> and merch, however, it was also met with controversy due to the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://gamerant.com/genshin-impact-fine-gacha-minor-data-ftc/">gacha system itself</a> and how the game <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental">reportedly handled the data of minors</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The open world title was hit with a $20 million fine back in January 2025. With miHoYo eventually complying with the FTC settlement, they have now announced a new requirement for US-based players that they need to follow if they&#8217;d like to keep their account.</p>



<h2 id="h-genshin-impact-will-require-age-verification-for-us-players" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Genshin Impact will require age verification for US players</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155805">blog post</a>, miHoYo announced that they&#8217;ll start rolling out an age verification process, as it&#8217;s required by the law.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This requirement is in line with their statement after agreeing with the settlement just a few months prior, in which they said they&#8217;ll be introducing a &#8220;new age-gate and parental consent protections for children and young teens&#8221; in the US.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to them, they&#8217;ll start implementing this to all US players on May 20, 2025, and it&#8217;ll be available to access while they&#8217;re logged in, or during account registration.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As for the process itself, players will need to provide their age by July 18, 2025. If they don&#8217;t do so, or if their account fails to get verified, then that account will be met with suspension. When this happens, in-game records and chats in that account will be deleted.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">To top it off, devs have also mentioned that there&#8217;ll be &#8220;No further notifications post-suspension due to inaccessible account information as required by law.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The most important part to keep in mind is that if the verification isn&#8217;t completed by <strong>July 20, 2026</strong>, then that HoYoverse account will be <strong>permanently deleted</strong>.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, if you&#8217;d like to keep your whole account as someone in the US, then you&#8217;ll need to make sure to go through this age verification process once it goes live.&#160;</p>
