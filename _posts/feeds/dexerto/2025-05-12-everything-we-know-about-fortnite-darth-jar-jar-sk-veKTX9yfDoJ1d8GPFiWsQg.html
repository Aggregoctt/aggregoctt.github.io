<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Darth Jar Jar Binks got everyone in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> talking when he appeared in the Galactic Battle trailer, especially when fans realised they could get him as a skin.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/full-star-wars-update-schedule-in-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-3186591/">Star Wars</a> has completely taken over Fortnite, with the map getting a sci-fi overhaul and all of the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/best-weapons-fortnite-ultimate-gun-tier-list-1535100/">weapons being replaced by blasters</a> with the signature sounds.  Plus, a number of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/all-fortnite-bosses-how-to-defeat-them-2269277/">iconic characters</a> can be found on the island, including Darth Maul and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/how-to-get-mace-windu-in-fortnite-use-his-lightsaber-3193458/">Mace Windu</a>. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But one face that was shown in the trailer that&#8217;s yet to appear is Darth Jar Jar Binks, leaving fans wondering how to unlock him. Here&#8217;s everything you need to know. </p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Darth Jar Jar <strong>will be available from the Fortnite store by spending V-Bucks</strong> when he&#8217;s added to the game. It hasn&#8217;t been confirmed exactly when he arrives, but leaks are pointing towards the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/fortnite-35-10-patch-notes-3194066/">35.10 update</a>, which drops on <strong>Thursday, May 15</strong>.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Many fans were hoping that he would be a Battle Pass skin that could be unlocked simply by playing, however, this spot was taken by Emperor Palpatine and General Grievous.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Based on previous store skins, we expect Darth Jar Jar to cost around 1,500 V-Bucks, which works out at around $12. Or, there will likely be a bundle that contains bonus cosmetics like Pickaxes, Back Blings, and Emotes, which will be closer to 2,200 V-Bucks. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Jar Jar Binks was seen in Star Wars: Episode I &#8211; The Phantom Menace back in 1999, the first of the prequel trilogy. The character was fairly divisive because of his goofy personality, but still appeared in the following two movies and The Clone Wars series.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Then, in the years since, a popular fan theory emerged which argued that Binks wasn&#8217;t the silly Gungan everyone thought, and that he is actually the mastermind behind The Empire. And so, &#8220;Darth Jar Jar&#8221; was born. </p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This has never been officially canonized by Disney or George Lucas, and probably never will, but his appearance in Fortnite is a nice nod for those familiar with the theory.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;ll be sure to update this page with a full breakdown of how much the Darth Jar Jar skin and how much the bundle costs as soon as it&#8217;s revealed by Epic Games.</p>
