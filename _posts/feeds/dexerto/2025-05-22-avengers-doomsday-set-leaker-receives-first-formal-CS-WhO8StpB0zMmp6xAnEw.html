<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/marvel/">Marvel</a> fan who snuck onto the set of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/avengers-the-kang-dynasty-release-date-cast-plot-more-1949725/">Avengers: Doomsday</a> and shared a now-viral video has now received a formal warning from the MCU, according to their latest update.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s no surprise that details surrounding Avengers: Doomsday are being kept tightly under wraps, although we do know the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/every-marvel-cinematic-universe-movie-tv-show-in-development-1849946/">upcoming MCU movie</a> will bring together every <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-superhero-movies-2653472/">superhero</a> but the kitchen sink for an Endgame-style battle.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">What&#8217;s more, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/robert-downey-jr-mcu-return-explained-doctor-doom-2843765/">Robert Downey Jr. will be returning to the franchise</a>, only as Doctor Doom instead of Tony Stark. However, with filming taking place in London, UK, as we speak, one fan managed to break onto the set.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Operating under the handle @theyneversawitcomingg, they <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/avengers-doomsday-set-video-leak-madripoor-marvel-3197056/">shared a video of the set on TikTok</a>, which quickly went viral. When it was removed, they reuploaded it to Instagram, and now Marvel has reportedly stepped in.&#160;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On Wednesday (May 21), the leaker added an Instagram Story to their <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.instagram.com/theyneversawitcomingg/?hl=en">account</a>, stating, &#8220;Received my first &#8216;formal threat&#8217;. I might be cooked.&#8221; Marvel has yet to publicly comment on the situation, although it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if the studio had taken action.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In the bio, they also wrote, &#8220;Video got removed, posting on Instagram.&#8221; It&#8217;s received hundreds of comments, with fellow fans warning them to be cautious.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;If it&#8217;s real, be careful, they can sue you and you know it,&#8221; said one, while another wrote, &#8220;Bro is getting sued to pieces.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A third added, &#8220;Yeah Kevin fiege is definitely going to come find you,&#8221; and a fourth chimed in, &#8220;Yeah you&#8217;re cooked buddy.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As well as the video, which showed a bar situated in the Marvel location of Madripoor, the user shared what appeared to be a blueprint of the home of Annie Reynolds &#8211;&#160;the mother of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/thunderbolts-villain-the-void-explained-3060888/">Thunderbolts&#8217; Bob Reynolds</a>. However, this appears to have been removed.</p>  



 
 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Although many of the comments are tongue-in-cheek, leaking footage from a Marvel set can carry serious legal consequences. Disney and Marvel Studios are notoriously protective of their intellectual property, and leaking unreleased content could land a person in court.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Depending on how the footage was obtained, the individual could face criminal trespassing charges, copyright infringement claims, or even civil suits over the disclosure of confidential material.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This wouldn&#8217;t be the first time Marvel has pursued leakers. In 2023, the studio filed a DMCA subpoena against Reddit to uncover the identity of users who leaked dialogue from <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-review-marvels-phase-5-gets-off-to-dull-disappointing-start-2060778/">Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</a> ahead of release.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a similar incident, The Expendables 3 was leaked online weeks before its debut, prompting Lionsgate to sue the anonymous uploaders for damages, claiming it impacted the movie&#8217;s box office performance. Whether Marvel or Disney will escalate this new case beyond a warning remains to be seen.</p>
