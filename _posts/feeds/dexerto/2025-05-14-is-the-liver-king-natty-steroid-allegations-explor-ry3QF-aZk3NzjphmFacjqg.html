<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Brian Johnson, aka <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/liver-king-confesses-that-hes-back-on-steroids-2276135/">the Liver King</a>, has found great success promoting his ancestral lifestyle (translation: eating cow testicles). But as is explored in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/netflix/">Netflix&#8217;s</a> latest Untold documentary, he&#8217;s been plagued by allegations that he uses steroids to achieve his physique.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Each episode of the Untold series centers on a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/true-crime/">true crime</a> case or scandal related to the world of sports. Following on from the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/gilbert-arenas-javaris-crittenton-now-netflix-untold-shooting-guards-3190707/">Gilbert Arenas and Javaris Crittenton</a> documentary is Untold: The Liver King.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Unless you&#8217;ve been living under a rock (which he&#8217;d probably prefer), you&#8217;ll know the name. The social media juggernaut gained millions of followers by championing a primal lifestyle. From <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/logan-paul-disgusted-as-brother-jake-paul-eats-bull-testicles-with-the-liver-king-1821525/">chomping on raw organs</a> to dragging trucks shirtless across fields, his viral antics earned him fame, ridicule, and a guest spot on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/impaulsive/">Logan Paul&#8217;s Impaulsive</a>.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Off-camera, Johnson built a supplement empire through his brands, including Ancestral Supplements, raking in millions in the process &#8211;&#160;all while swearing his ripped body was 100% natural. But is it true?</p> 



<h2 id="h-is-the-liver-king-on-steroids?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Is the Liver King on steroids?</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to Brian himself, the answer is <strong>no</strong> &#8211;&#160;but this has been a recent development. A few years back, a series of blood tests and emails between the Liver King and a body-building coach revealed he was on human growth hormones, steroids, and performance-enhancing drugs.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This contradicted his public claims of achieving his physique solely through natural means. Derek from More Plates More Dates exposed the leaked materials on his YouTube channel back in November 2022.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In Brian&#8217;s email, sent in June 2021, he listed the various medications he&#8217;d been taking, including:&#160;</p>



<ul class="pl-10 mt-1 overflow-y-hidden font-body text-body-1 text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white dark:text-body-1 dark:font-body mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text List_list___uTwY wp-block-list">
<li>Deca-Durabolin &#8211; 0.6cc per week</li>



<li>Winstrol &#8211; 50mg per day</li>



<li>Testosterone cypionate &#8211; 0.6cc per week</li>



<li>Omnitrope &#8211; Four 5.8mg vials per week</li>



<li>IGF-1 LR &#8211; Amount unspecified</li>



<li>CJC with Ipamorelin &#8211; Amount unspecified</li>



<li>Ibutamoren &#8211; Amount unspecified</li>
</ul>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">These substances include a mix of anabolic steroids (like Deca-Durabolin and Winstrol), synthetic testosterone, and growth hormone agents such as Omnitrope, IGF-1 LR, and Ibutamoren.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Collectively, they are used to increase muscle mass, reduce fat, and enhance recovery, providing the Liver King with a clear performance edge and making his previous &#8220;all natural&#8221; claims difficult to defend.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As is revealed in Netflix&#8217;s latest <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/netflix-untold-new-movies-2025-2893540/">Untold documentary</a>, he was still taking some form of performance-enhancing substances up until recently&#160;&#8211; he even injects himself on screen, although doesn&#8217;t reveal which specific drug it is.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, in a six month flash forward, Brian claims he&#8217;s no longer on any substances and has now started incorporating fruit and vegetables into his diet. &#8220;I guess I want the world to know I was wrong,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I got it wrong.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Prior to the 2022 leaks, Brian denied all of the allegations, claiming he was &#8220;natty&#8221; (natural). But when the More Plates More Dates video dropped, he ended up admitting the truth in an <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/liver-king-confirms-steroid-use-in-apology-video-i-lied-2001176/">apology video</a>.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Johnson&#8217;s wife Barbara, aka the Liver Queen, admits that she was pushing Brian to keep quiet. In the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/shocking-netflix-documentaries-2890798/">Netflix documentary</a>, she maintains her position.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;You&#8217;re not even an athlete. You&#8217;re just the Liver King on social media. You&#8217;re just trying to spread to the world how we live, you know? So yeah, I was all behind it not to share that part,&#8221; she says.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-did-he-get-sued?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Did he get sued?</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As well as impacting his social media following and reputation, <strong>Brian Johnson was hit with a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/liver-king-sued-for-25m-over-deceiving-customers-with-steroid-use-2019825/">$25 million class-action lawsuit</a></strong> claiming he used deceptive marketing to sell products from his Ancestral Supplements and The Fittest Ever lines of pills and powders.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The lawsuit was filed in New York&#8217;s Supreme Court on behalf of Christopher Altomare and other &#8220;vulnerable and health-conscious consumers,&#8221; but in March 2023, the case was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking about the results at the time, Richard D. Collins &#8211;&#160;who specializes in sports nutrition law at Collins Gann McCloskey &amp; Barry PLLC &#8211;&#160;told <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.supplysidesj.com/supplement-regulations/news-exclusive-viral-25-million-liver-king-lawsuit-finished-kaput-dead-">SupplySide SJ</a> that this means the case is &#8220;finished, kaput, dead.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing in the filing that says why [Altomare] killed off his own case,&#8221; Collins added. &#8220;In fact, no motions were ever filed in the case. It&#8217;s a bare-bones court docket.&#8221; However, the likelihood is that they reached a settlement.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Collins explained, &#8220;Ordinarily, that means the defendant paid money, and perhaps took some other remedial action. But we won&#8217;t know whether or not that happened here because the existence of settlement agreements and their terms are usually protected by a confidentiality clause.&#8221;</p> 



<h2 id="h-is-his-business-ancestral-supplements-still-active?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Is his business Ancestral Supplements still active?</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Yes, <strong>Brian Johnson&#8217;s organ-based supplement company, Ancestral Supplements, remains active as of May 2025</strong>. Despite the controversies surrounding his steroid use and the subsequent lawsuit, Johnson continues to operate his business.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ancestral Supplements, along with its sister brand The Fittest Ever, reportedly generated over $100 million in annual revenue at the height of Brian&#8217;s popularity. These brands continue to market and sell a range of supplements.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This ranges from male optimization product King, which combines testicle, heart, liver, and bone marrow &#8220;to support manhood and virility,&#8221; to Grass Fed Beef Organs, said to &#8220;support energy, digestion, detox, iron levels, and whole body health.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He still has a strong following on social media, too &#8211;&#160;6.1 million on TikTok and 2.9 million on Instagram. While Johnson&#8217;s public image has been affected by the revelations, his business operations and online presence no doubt keep him afloat.&#160;</p>
