<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Andor has now drawn to a close, and showrunner Tony Gilroy has been discussing why Darth Vader doesn&#8217;t show up in the finale.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/how-tall-is-darth-vader-2585627/">Darth Vader</a> looms large over <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> &#8211; both metaphorically and literally &#8211; and is a major reason why the franchise so captured the imagination of moviegoers worldwide. That&#8217;s because a good adventure needs a great villain, and Vader isn&#8217;t just the ultimate bad guy, but arguably the greatest antagonist in all of cinema.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The character&#8217;s brief cameo at the end of Rogue One had audiences clapping and cheering, so when a prequel series revolving around Rogue One character Andor was announced, fans started speculating over whether Vader might appear.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, although the construction of his Death Star is the driving force behind the events of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/andor/">Andor</a> Season 1 and Season 2, Darth Vader doesn&#8217;t appear onscreen during the climax.</p>



<h2 id="h-andor-&#8220;didn&#8217;t-need&#8221;-darth-vader" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Andor &#8220;didn&#8217;t need&#8221; Darth Vader</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Andor Season 2 ends as Rogue One is beginning, with Cassian about to join up with Jyn Erso&#8217;s rag-tag band of rebels to steal the Death Star plans. Meaning there was no place for Darth Vader in this particular part of the story.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Deadline asked Tony Gilroy why Vader and his equally evil colleague Grand Moff Tarkin don&#8217;t show up at any point in the climax, and the showrunner bluntly <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/andor-season-2-finale-tony-gilroy-1236387522/">responded with</a>: &#8220;If I&#8217;d needed them, I would&#8217;ve brought them in.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">And there&#8217;s little reason to doubt Gilroy could have used Vader if he&#8217;d wanted, as in a different interview, he maintained that Disney gave him &#8220;total freedom.&#8221;</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;What they did is such a huge gamble, and it&#8217;s such a credit to them,&#8221; Gilroy <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/andor-finale-diego-luna-tony-gilroy-star-wars-1236394652/">told</a> Variety. &#8220;They really were Medicis on this. They watched what we did. We had economic reasons for changing things, and certainly conversations on a weekly basis about that as the shrinking pie came around. But no one ever said, &#8216;Man, don&#8217;t do this,&#8217; or &#8216;Do that,&#8217; or &#8216;Hey wait, what are you doing?&#8217; Never. It&#8217;ll never happen again for&#160;me, I don&#8217;t think.&#8221;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So without Darth Vader cameoing at the end, Andor instead ends on a brief moment of hope, that we know will ultimately result in the Rebellion&#8217;s victory.</p>
