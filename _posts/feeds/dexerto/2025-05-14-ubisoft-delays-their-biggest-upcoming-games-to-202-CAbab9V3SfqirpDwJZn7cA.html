<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ubisoft says it&#8217;s &#8220;biggest productions&#8221; won&#8217;t arrive until 2026 at the earliest. While fans wait, the publisher will rely on core franchises and back-catalog favorites to carry the weight.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In recent years, Ubisoft has seen varying results across its biggest series. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-dlc-3053786/">Assassin&#8217;s Creed</a> continues to perform well. Rainbow Six remains a reliable live-service success. Other franchises like Far Cry and The Crew have delivered solid, if uneven, results.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That momentum, however, will have to stretch a while longer. Ubisoft announced in its <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/investors">latest financial report</a> that its most anticipated new games are now scheduled for release in 2026 or later. The publisher is extending its development timelines, focusing on quality and long-term player engagement.</p> 



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-delays-biggest-games-until-2026&#8211;27" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Ubisoft delays biggest games until 2026&#8211;27</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This year, Ubisoft reported $2.01 billion in revenue, slightly below its target. The company attributed the shortfall to &#8220;lower than expected partnerships&#8221; and &#8220;timing impacts,&#8221; suggesting that key content arrived too late to influence the bottom line.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Assassin&#8217;s Creed Shadows launched in March following a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-reason-revealed-by-ubisoft-and-its-not-what-you-think-2916387/">delay</a>. Ubisoft noted it had the second-best day-one sales revenue in the franchise&#8217;s history, behind 2020&#8217;s Valhalla. It also reported 160 million hours played to date, though it declined to share new player numbers since passing <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-player-count-3166259/">3 million</a> shortly after launch.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Meanwhile, the company highlighted steady engagement across its top brands: both Assassin&#8217;s Creed and Rainbow Six drew around 30 million unique players this year, while Far Cry drew around 20 million. These back-catalog figures have become increasingly important as the company moves toward longer development cycles.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Cost-cutting also played a major role in Ubisoft&#8217;s fiscal strategy. The company trimmed $217.2 million in fixed costs ahead of schedule, in part by reducing its headcount by 3,000 employees since 2022. It now plans to save an additional $108.6 million over the next two years.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Looking ahead, Ubisoft plans to launch a new <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/assassins-creed/ubisoft-reportedly-preparing-anti-harassment-plan-for-ac-shadows-launch-3164136/">Tencent</a>-backed subsidiary to manage its top brands: Assassin&#8217;s Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The focus will be on improving single-player storytelling, expanding live-service features, and growing in mobile and emerging markets like China.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Despite delays, Ubisoft is positioning itself for long-term growth. Its core franchises remain strong, but the next few years will test how long that strength can hold without new flagship releases.</p>
