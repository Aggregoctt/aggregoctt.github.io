<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Disney has filed a lawsuit against YouTube after the Google-owned platform poached one of its top executives, fearing he will leak confidential information.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In May, Justin Connolly resigned from his position as Disney Entertainment&#8217;s president of platform distribution and looked to sign with <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/">YouTube</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Connolly was responsible for bringing <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/disney/">Disney</a>&#8217;s TV networks to providers and overseeing contract agreements to bring Disney&#8217;s content, such as movies, to streaming services.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Disney claims that Connolly had signed a deal with them to keep him with the company until 2027 and was barred from engaging in dealings with competitors &#8211; something that would prevent him from joining YouTube.</p> 



<h2 id="h-disney-fears-top-executive-will-leak-confidential-information-to-youtube" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Disney fears top executive will leak confidential information to YouTube</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As reported by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.c21media.net/news/disney-sues-youtube-over-hiring-of-platform-distribution-president-justin-connolly/">C21</a>, Disney filed a lawsuit in state court in Los Angeles to stop the appointment, alleging breach of contract, tortious interference with contractual relations and unfair competition.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-22/youtube-poaches-disney-official-to-oversee-global-media-sports">Bloomberg</a>, Connolly was set to join YouTube as part of a new position at the company where he would be in charge of the platform&#8217;s relationship with major media companies and growing the service&#8217;s live-sports portfolio.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Disney reportedly fears that Connolly could reveal confidential information or their trade secrets. The company&#8217;s distribution deal with YouTube TV expires in the fall and Connolly&#8217;s inside knowledge could put Disney at a disadvantage in the upcoming renegotiations.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Connolly has intimate knowledge of Disney&#8217;s other distribution deals, the financial details concerning Disney&#8217;s content being licensed to YouTube, and Disney&#8217;s negotiation strategies, both in general and in particular with respect to YouTube,&#8221; Disney lawyer Kavin Gaut said in the complaint.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It would be extremely prejudicial to Disney for Connolly to breach the contract which he negotiated just a few months ago and switch teams when Disney is working on a new licensing deal with the company that is trying to poach him.&#8221;</p>
