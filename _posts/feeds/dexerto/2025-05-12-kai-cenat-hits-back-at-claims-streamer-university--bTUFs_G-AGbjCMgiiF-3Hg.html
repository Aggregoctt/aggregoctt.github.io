<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Kai Cenat has hit back at claims that his Streamer University is a &#8220;scam&#8221; and &#8220;money grab&#8221; as he has started accepting some content creators.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Back in February, Kai Cenat<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/kai-cenat-has-massive-university-plan-to-help-twitch-streamers-with-mrbeast-involved-3131895/"> announced that he had plans to start a Streamer University</a> in one of his biggest ideas yet. The AMP star revealed that he wanted to bring content creators together in a school environment and have some of the biggest streamers around teach them the ropes on a few things.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fast forward to May, and the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/kai-cenat-finally-launches-streamer-university-everyone-wants-in-3190825/">Twitch superstar finally rolled out his application process </a>for those who want to learn and also for those who want to teach.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, Los Pollos TV&#8217;s dad claimed that the whole thing is a &#8220;money grab&#8221; for Kai. &#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s a money grab. Thats a f**king money grab!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Thats like these f**king idiots who take stand-up comedy classes. You ever see that f**king scam? You&#8217;re gonna teach somebody how to be a streamer? Ok!&#8221;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The claim quickly got onto Kai&#8217;s radar and he responded to it during his May 11 broadcast, saying it &#8220;broke my heart&#8221; to hear it from Los Pollos&#8217; dad.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I think I seen like Los&#8217;s dad, I&#8217;m a big f**king fan of Los&#8217; father, gang. The n***a gone said my sh*t a scam. Los, I f**k with Los pops so heavy. When he said this sh** gonna be a scam, that sh*t broke my heart,&#8221; he said.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Kai added that people are &#8220;not doing research&#8221; on his plans. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s kind of like, I think it&#8217;s hard to fathom that this is actually happening, gang. You feel me?&#8221; he concluded.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As noted, Kai does want some big names involved, and he initially name-dropped MrBeast and Mark Rober as ideal mentors.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/mrbeast-responds-to-kai-cenats-streamer-university-as-twitch-star-wants-him-involved-3193064/">MrBeast did respond to his application process being open</a>, asking if he could come on board and &#8220;teach&#8221; creators how to do YouTube.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Twitch streamer ExtraEmily has also applied to join Kai&#8217;s faculty team. Though, who knows if she&#8217;ll make the cut.</p>
