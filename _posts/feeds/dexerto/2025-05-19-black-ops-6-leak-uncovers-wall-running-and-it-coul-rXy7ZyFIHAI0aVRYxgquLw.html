<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/black-ops-6/">Black Ops 6</a> completely reinvented the movement system with the addition of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-dev-addresses-whether-omnimovement-will-be-used-in-future-cods-3006834/">omnimovement</a>, allowing for sprinting in all directions and flashier jumps and slides. However, it&#8217;s still a far cry from the jetpack era of CoD. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In these games, such as Black Ops 3 and Advanced Warfare, players could fly through the air and even run along walls to get the drop on their enemies. Now, it appears that the devs might be considering bringing wall running back, as dataminers have found the feature within Black Ops 6.</p> 



<h2 id="h-wall-running-found-in-bo6-ahead-of-cod-2025" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Wall running found in BO6 ahead of CoD 2025</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 18, videos began surfacing on both TikTok and X of players wall running in Black Ops 6. Although clearly a rough version of the feature, the clips show players sticking to and running along surfaces just by jumping towards them, allowing for much easier traversal around the map. </p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Videos have also popped up of the feature being used in Warzone, although it&#8217;s unclear if it can be used in real matches or just in private lobbies.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to &#8216;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.youtube.com/@CALLOFDUTYWARFARE-z4f">CALL OF DUTY WARFARE</a>,&#8217; a leaker known for showing off skins and bundles before they arrive, this has been made possible after it was added to the BO6 and Warzone files in the Season 3 Reloaded update. He shared a screenshot of code that specifically says &#8220;AllowWallRun.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s unclear right now why this was added, but it has been speculated that it could be to test wall running before it&#8217;s added to the next game in the series. </p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Leaks have revealed that <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-2025-details-2439485/">Call of Duty 2025</a>, which is reportedly a Black Ops 2 sequel, will feature an upgraded version of omnimovement, so it&#8217;s not impossible that it would include wall running. In fact, leaks from as far back as November 2024 from <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1862961948138119487">TheGhostOfHope</a> indicated that a &#8220;more realistic&#8221; version wall running is coming in the next title. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Previous leaks have claimed that &#8216;Black Ops 7&#8217; will feature a remake of every BO2 map, just like MW3 did with the original MW2 maps. So, if wall running is coming to CoD 2025, it remains to be seen if the maps will need to be tweaked to fit in the extra mobility. </p>
