<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When the HBO show first debuted in 2019, it captured the cultural zeitgeist. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/euphoria/">Euphoria</a> became to Gen Z what Skins was to millennials, following a group of high school students as they struggle with drugs, love, social media, and identity.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It also made Sydney Sweeney the star she is today. Since her epic performance as the ever-troubled Cassie Howard, she&#8217;s gone on to land roles in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-white-lotus-season-3-mistake-3134080/">The White Lotus</a>, Anyone But You, Immaculate, and Madame Web, with plenty more in the pipeline.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As for Cassie, she went from naive hero to despicable villain in Season 2 when she started dating her bestie&#8217;s toxic ex Nate (<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/jacob-elordi-explains-why-he-turned-down-superman-role-without-hesitation-2382261/">Jacob Elordi</a>), but that&#8217;s not the last we&#8217;ve seen from her&#160;&#8211;&#160;far from it.</p>



<h2 id="h-sydney-sweeney-talks-about-long-awaited-euphoria-season-3" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Sydney Sweeney talks about long awaited Euphoria Season 3</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a new interview with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/sydney-sweeney-the-empire-interview/">Empire</a>, Sweeney revealed she&#8217;s currently filming for <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/euphoria-most-criticized-character-returns-in-season-3-3132885/">Euphoria Season 3</a>, and that the new chapter is going to be &#8220;unhinged.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I am filming Euphoria right now, but I had a little bit of time off,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m shooting a beauty campaign in Barcelona.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Sweeney continued, &#8220;I have such a spot in my heart for Cassie, and I hold her really close and dear. She is crazy. She makes so many mistakes. She&#8217;s flawed on so many levels, but she does it all from a place of love.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It could be a sad version of love, as well. It&#8217;s so much fun to play a character that is as crazy as she is.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Sam [Levinson] is such a brilliant filmmaker to work with, because I&#8217;ll read something, then I&#8217;ll call him, and I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Let&#8217;s go crazier.&#8217; And he&#8217;s like, &#8216;I&#8217;m all in.&#8217; And this season is unhinged.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When asked if it&#8217;s &#8220;more unhinged&#8221; than previous chapters, she confirmed, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Of course, no plot details can be shared at this time, but it&#8217;s good news, especially given <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/euphoria-cast-2629801/">the wait for Season 3</a> has been particularly long.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For some time, it was believed that Euphoria would never return due to scheduling conflicts with the show&#8217;s star-studded cast, including <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/euphoria-season-3-delay-pits-zendaya-and-sam-levinson-against-each-other-2835323/">Spider-Man&#8217;s Zendaya</a>.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Thankfully, these concerns were quashed, and it sounds like Levinson isn&#8217;t holding any punches now that the cast is back together.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As for Cassie&#8217;s arc, a leaked clip from the set last month showed Sweeney in a wedding dress walking down an aisle with the initials &#8216;C &amp; N&#8217;, leading to rumors she&#8217;ll be marrying Nate in Season 3.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s an issue with this, however. Not only has the leak not been confirmed by any official source, but the initial might be referring to someone else.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">What&#8217;s even likelier is that it&#8217;s for a fantasy scene. Remember in Season 2 when Nate dreamed of Cassie being pregnant with his child? Maybe this is Cassie&#8217;s version, walking down the aisle to her bestie&#8217;s ex.</p>
