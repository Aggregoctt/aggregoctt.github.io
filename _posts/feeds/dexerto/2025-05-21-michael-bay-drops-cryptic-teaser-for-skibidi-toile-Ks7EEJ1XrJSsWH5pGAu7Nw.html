<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Production on Michael Bay&#8217;s <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/what-is-the-skibidi-toilet-viral-singing-toilet-videos-explained-2228747/">Skibidi Toilet</a> movie has officially begun, and the director has already shared a weird teaser that&#8217;s left fans confused&#8230; and excited. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In February 2023, Alexey Gerasimov &#8211;&#160;via his YouTube channel DaFuq!?Boom! &#8211; uploaded an 11-second video of a man&#8217;s head emerging from a toilet singing a nonsensical version of Timbaland&#8217;s &#8216;Give It To Me.&#8217; It spawned the world of Skibidi Toilet, one of the internet&#8217;s strangest and biggest sensations. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Without getting too deep into the lore, it has a simple story: the Skibidi Toilets try to take over the human race, sparking a war against the Cameramaen, Speakermen, and TV-men. However, down the line, they need to contend with the Astro Toilets, a race of extraterrestrial toilets that pose a grave threat to Earth. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Okay, maybe it&#8217;s not that simple, but Bay&#8217;s involvement makes sense; it is one of the most explosive and irreverent web series ever made, and he&#8217;s made some of the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-action-movies-of-all-time-2755952/">best action movies</a> of all time. Now, the film is shooting, and the director is giving fans a taste of what to expect. </p> 



<h2 id="h-michael-bay&#8217;s-skibidi-toilet-teaser-leaves-fans-confused-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Michael Bay&#8217;s Skibidi Toilet teaser leaves fans confused </h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After Invisible Narratives (Bay&#8217;s media company) dropped a press release announcing Skibidi Toilet was in production, the filmmaker posted an Instagram Reel that may indicate what the film is actually about. </p>



 
 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The reel shows the Bayhem logo (a term Bay has now trademarked), before you see two people looking up at the sky. &#8220;They are coming,&#8221; the text on the video reads. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Could it be that the film will mostly revolve around the conflict with the Astro Toilets, with the movie giving more of an overview of the battles between the Skibidi Toilets and humanity&#8217;s alliances? </p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Wonder if the Skibidi Toilets are going to be aliens invading Earth. If so, that sounds cool,&#8221; one user commented. &#8220;Skibidi toilet alien invasion type of movie?&#8221; another speculated. &#8220;The Skibidi Toilets/Astro Toilets are about to invade Earth,&#8221; a third wrote.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Others are still baffled, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re not hyped. &#8220;I seriously, SERIOUSLY cannot f**king believe this is real. Wtf is the STORY even going to be?&#8221; one user wrote. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;This needs to be the most violent, action-packed movie you&#8217;ve ever made,&#8221; another commented. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Four days prior, Bay posted another reel of an AI-generated street with battered buildings and raging fires. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, not going to use AI in my films &#8211; but there is a clue here,&#8221; he wrote, and it&#8217;s clear now that it&#8217;s linked to Skibidi Toilet. </p>



 
 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Beyond this, little has been confirmed about what shape the movie will take; will it be live-action or a hybrid with animation, will it include dialogue, and who will star in it? Hopefully these questions are answered soon. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We know the project has tapped VFX supervisor Rob Legato (who served in the same role on Avatar and Titanic), so you should expect an enormous spectacle. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In an earlier statement, Invisible Narratives CEO Adam Goodman promised that if they ever &#8220;decided to go film or television&#8221; that it would be &#8220;lifted beyond the resources that creators have on the internet.&#8221;</p>
