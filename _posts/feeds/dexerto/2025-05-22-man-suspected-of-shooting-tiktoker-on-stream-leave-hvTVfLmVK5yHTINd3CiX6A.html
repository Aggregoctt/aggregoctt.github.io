<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Police say the man suspected of assassinating 23-year-old TikToker Valeria M&#225;rquez at her salon left a note with a bouquet of red roses at the murder scene.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 13, 2025, before M&#225;rquez arrived at her salon in Zapopan, Mexico, a masked man entered the building <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mystery-influencer-shot-dead-livestream-35259275">posing as a delivery driver</a> claiming to have a &#8220;very expensive&#8221; gift for her that had to be given in person.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When the influencer eventually showed up, she appeared concerned, telling her stream: &#8220;Maybe they were going to kill me. Were they going to come and take me away, or what?&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Just hours after, another man showed up and asked for the influencer by name before proceeding to shoot her three times and then fled the scene alongside an accomplice.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The live-stream murder became international news and footage of the murder was scrubbed from her page as a manhunt for the suspect began.</p>



<h2 id="h-suspect-leaves-note-where-tiktoker-was-killed-on-stream" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Suspect leaves note where TikToker was killed on stream</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Days after the murder, a bouquet of red roses and a note was <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/35044654/suspect-killer-valeria-marquez-bouquet-red-roses/">left at the salon</a>. The authorities were quick to intercept the package, believing it was from the suspected killer.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The note simply contained the words &#8220;Sorry&#8221; and nothing else.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://derechadiario.com.ar/us/argentina/valeria-marquez-crime-escape-of-the-hitman-and-sinister-bouquet-with-forgiveness">La Derecha Diario</a>, the package was delivered by someone through an anonymous individual through an app, and have incorporated the delivery into their investigation.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The police say M&#225;rquez had no links to criminal activity. Denis Rodr&#237;guez, a spokesperson for the Jalisco State Prosecutor&#8217;s Office believes the TikToker was targeted by hitmen.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;It appears he didn&#8217;t know her. With that, you can deduce &#8211; without jumping to conclusions &#8211; that this was a person who was paid&#8230; obviously someone who came with a purpose,&#8221; he <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://people.com/influencer-shot-dead-during-livestream-may-have-been-killed-by-hit-men-prosecutors-say-11737095">said</a>.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Authorities are also investigating the murder of a former congressman in the area mere hours before M&#225;rquez was fatally shot. In that instance, two men escaped on a motorbike as well, leaving police to believe the two could be connected.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Meanwhile, Jalisco Governor Pablo Lemus Navarro has reportedly claimed that the police have a composite sketch of the killer and &#8220;precise data&#8221; of those involved.</p>
