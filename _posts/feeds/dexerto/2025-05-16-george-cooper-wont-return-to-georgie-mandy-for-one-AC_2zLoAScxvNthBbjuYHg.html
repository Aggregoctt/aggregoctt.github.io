<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Episode 12 of the Georgie &amp; Mandy spinoff saw <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/georgie-and-mandys-first-marriage-george-return-mistake-3052146/">George return</a> from the grave &#8211; and for a split second, it was the most traumatizing experience possible. George appears in Georgie&#8217;s dreams while he&#8217;s off sick from work with a fever, briefly turning into a zombie to get Georgie back to work.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We don&#8217;t see him after this episode, and we had only seen Georgie talking to his tombstone beforehand. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/young-sheldon-george-cooper-sr-obituary-2714637/">George&#8217;s death</a> broke our hearts at the end of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/young-sheldon-ending-explained-season-7-finale-breakdown-2727425/">Young Sheldon Season 7</a>, with <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/young-sheldon-season-7-episode-13-recap-2727382/">the funeral episode</a> finishing off anyone who still had a will to live.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Before the spinoff, George&#8217;s return seemed totally impossible, yet it happened. So could be become a recurring character? According to the spinoff&#8217;s cast, you shouldn&#8217;t hold your breath. </p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking to Dexerto, star Montana Jordan explained further that George Cooper cameos &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t&#8221; be likely thanks to the show&#8217;s overarching storyline.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I mean, that would kind of be going against the storyline,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He&#8217;s passed away and now you&#8217;ve seen Georgie become the man of the household. But hey, maybe we&#8217;d see him as a ghost someday. There ain&#8217;t no telling.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If anything, fans should feel lucky there was a return at all. &#8220;His dad visits him in a dream,&#8221; Holland <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://tvline.com/news/georgie-and-mandys-first-marriage-lance-barber-returning-george-young-sheldon-dad-1235404183/">explained</a> [via TV Line] at the time. &#8220;George is thinking about his dad, and he&#8217;s worried that his dad might be disappointed in him&#8230; [The idea] came out of a conversation we&#8217;d had with Chuck, even early on, talking about the show.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Chuck had said about his own father that he still dreams about him, he still visits him, so that was a thing we had thought about. And then when we were breaking this episode, it just seemed like a great opportunity to bring George back.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Dexerto spoke to actor Lance Barber, who played George, before the spinoff even began airing about the same possibility. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;If the writers decided to do that, they would do that in a thoughtful and classy way as opposed to a stunt to get people to watch the ghost of George Cooper return. If that could be done, then I would consider it. Otherwise, I&#8217;m really satisfied,&#8221; he <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/george-cooper-georgie-mandys-first-marriage-cameo-lance-barber-2920945/">told</a> us.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A happy medium was clearly found, but two times in a row? It&#8217;s probably the most unlikely thing to happen in the show&#8217;s new season. </p>
