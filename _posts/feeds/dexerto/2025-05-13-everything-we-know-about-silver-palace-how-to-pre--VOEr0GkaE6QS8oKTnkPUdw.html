<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Silver Palace is an upcoming fantasy world ARPG that combines flashy <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/genshin-impact/">Genshin Impact</a>-style combat with Victorian-inspired aesthetics.

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Silver Palace, otherwise known as &#8220;Victorian&#8221; Genshin Impact, has quickly caught the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/best-upcoming-gacha-games-3009756/">gacha game</a> community&#8217;s attention.

<h2 id="h-trailers-are-there-any-trailers-for-x" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Trailers </h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Silver Palace&#8217;s first trailer was revealed on May 13, 2025. It showcases the female protagonist as she walks through the streets of Silvernia, an industrialized metropolis inspired by Victorian-era Britain. </p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The 10-minute trailer also showcases how players can use a mechanized horse to gallop through environments, while also utilizing a grappling hook to latch onto railings that help speed up traversal. Silver Palace&#8217;s traversal mechanics don&#8217;t just stop there, though, as the mount can also fly through the air, allowing you to explore the city rooftops. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We also got a great look at the game&#8217;s combat, with the MC switching between both melee and ranged attacks. You can see the full trailer above. </p> 



<h2 id="h-x-gameplay-leaks-story-details" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Silver Palace gameplay </h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Like Genshin Impact, Silver Palace enables you to freely switch between four characters, allowing you to unleash powerful skills and combos. There are also quick time events (QTEs), which enable the use of deadly attacks that deal huge amounts of damage. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Characters can also block incoming damage and deliver deadly finishers, with one character shown using a syringe to kill a target and deliver a deadly AoE explosion. Adding to this are stealth sections, where the MC is shown sneaking behind enemies, using takedowns to eliminate and get information from targets. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As we mentioned earlier, traversal is a big part of Silver Palace, with characters having access to a mount that can gallop around the city and fly through the skies above. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to the official description, Silver Palace gameplay revolves around hunting for clues and battling the factions that inhabit Silvernia.</p>



<h2 id="h-story" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Story</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We currently don&#8217;t have too many details regarding Silver Palace&#8217;s story, but we know players assume the role of a &#8220;detective tasked with investigating crimes and uncovering hidden truths.&#8221; </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Silvernia is also home to various factions, from corporate monopolies, underground syndicates, royal affiliates, and cults, who are all vying for control of Silverium. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This resource is the key to the city&#8217;s industrialization and has &#8220;transformed technology and daily life beyond imagination, attracting numerous residents and fostering innovation.&#8221; </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Players will likely need to stop this &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; resource from falling into the wrong hands and prevent any disasters. </p>

After leaving Silvernia for three years following a disaster, the detective has returned to the city. </p>
