<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A Valorant Mobile leaker has revealed the game will be receiving a plethora of social features, with one of them reportedly working similarly to TikTok.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/valorant/valorant-mobile-leak-seemingly-reveals-full-gameplay-and-controls-1811597/">Leaks regarding Valorant Mobile</a> have been circulating around the internet for a while, but it was only on April 21, 2025, that we gotten an official confirmation from Riot the game is actually real and coming soon. Naturally, there was a lot of hype around the official announcement, considering the idea of playing the game on the go is an enticing one.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Regardless of fans&#8217; excitement, though, there&#8217;s a huge catch. Not much is known about the game&#8217;s global release date at the time of writing, as Riot is only holding playtests exclusively in China to begin with.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That said, almost a month after this announcement, new <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/valorant/valorant-mobile-everything-we-know-1585425/">details regarding the game</a> have already emerged. Based on leaked information, it appears Valorant Mobile could introduce a new feature that&#8217;s similar to TikTok.</p> 



<h2 id="h-all-leaked-features-for-valorant-mobile" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">All leaked features for Valorant Mobile</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to a leaker in a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/ValorantMobileX/status/1924095750080020526">post on X</a>, the game will have features not available in the PC version&#8212;and if there&#8217;s one that stands out more than the rest, it has to be the &#8220;TikTok-style feature.&#8221;&#160;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The way this feature works is described as a &#8220;TikTok-like shorts system&#8221;, allowing players to be able to post clips and like others&#8217; clips. Other social features could also be present, such as the Global Chat system, the gifting system, and the In-game recruitment.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">These have yet to be elaborated on, but it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how exactly they&#8217;ll be implemented later.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Additionally, though it&#8217;s still in the early days, it&#8217;s safe to assume these are likely possible. Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, a well-known title on the same platform, has already done something similar, albeit with watching other players&#8217; live streams directly in the game.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Aside from these social features, other ones that have leaked and are worth mentioning are the replay system, Spectator Mode (VCT format), custom rooms, highlight clips, and custom load-outs for each agent&#8217;s cosmetics, among <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/valorant/valorant-mobile-leaks-reveal-features-everyone-wants-on-pc-console-2894630/">other additions</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Meanwhile, cosmetics-wise, it&#8217;s suggested that there&#8217;ll be free skins that can be obtained from missions. Either way, the title is already shaping up to be quite an exciting one so far.</p>
