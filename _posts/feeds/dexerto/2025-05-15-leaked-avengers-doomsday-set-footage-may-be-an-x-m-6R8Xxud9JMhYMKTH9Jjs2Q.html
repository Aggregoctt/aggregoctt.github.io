<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Footage from the set of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/avengers-the-kang-dynasty-release-date-cast-plot-more-1949725/">Avengers: Doomsday</a> has been leaked online, and while the video is brief, it may be a hint of what to expect from the X-Men&#8217;s introduction to the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/marvel/">MCU</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s not a spoiler to say the X-Men are part of the Avengers: Doomsday cast. After all, their names (Ian McKellen, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/avengers-doomsday-alan-cumming-nightcrawler-fights-reed-richards-pedro-pascal-3194237/">Alan Cumming</a>, Kelsey Grammar, James Marsden, Channing Tatum, Rebecca Romijn, and Patrick Stewart, to be exact) were included in the livestream announcement in March. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">What remains unclear is why and how they&#8217;re in the new movie; will the MCU&#8217;s heroes travel to their universe, or will they be transported to the Earth-616 timeline? </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you&#8217;ve seen supposedly leaked images of Marsden and McKellen, there&#8217;s a good chance they&#8217;re AI-generated. However, this clip appears to be real. </p>



<h2 id="h-avengers:-doomsday-leak-may-contain-a-sentinel-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Avengers: Doomsday leak may contain a Sentinel </h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The clip, posted to the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Avengers/comments/1kir9yq/inside_view_of_the_set_of_avengers_doomsday/">Avengers subreddit by booletproof_dummy</a>, shows a garden with a few statues. Notably, there&#8217;s something covered with a blue tarp&#8230; and it looks like a leg. </p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This could be anything, but amid the speculating, one answer is the likeliest: we may be looking at a garden at the Xavier Institute, and that could be a Sentinel. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For those who aren&#8217;t au fait with X-Men, Sentinels are basically mutant-hunting robots, and they&#8217;re incredibly strong (if you don&#8217;t believe me, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/x-men-97-saddest-show-of-2024-2993106/">watch the &#8216;Remember It&#8217; episode of X-Men &#8217;97</a>). They appeared in Days of Future Past, but if they are Sentinels, they could look a bit different (and more comic accurate, given the purple and blue) in Doomsday. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;HOLY CRAP THAT IS 100% X-MANSION AND YOU CAN SEE A DESTROYED SENTINEL ON THE FLOOR,&#8221; one user wrote. &#8220;Looks like the Xavier Institute. And that might be indeed a Sentinel,&#8221; another commented.</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Sentinel? That was already averted during Days of Future Past, remember?&#8221; one fan pointed out, but it&#8217;s worth remembering that this could be an alternate version of Fox&#8217;s X-Men. Another fan suggested it could be a Doombot, which is feasible, considering the film&#8217;s big bad will be Robert Downey Jr&#8217;s Doctor Doom.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While unconfirmed, it&#8217;s rumored that Doomsday will involve an &#8220;epic fight&#8221; between the Avengers and the X-Men, possibly incited by Doctor Doom for his own agenda. <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/why-the-x-men-will-die-in-avengers-doomsday-3171006/">The question is, will the X-Men survive?</a></p>
