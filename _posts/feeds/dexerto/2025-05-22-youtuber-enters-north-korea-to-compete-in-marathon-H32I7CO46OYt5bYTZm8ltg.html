<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">North Korea opened its borders for its annual Pyongyang Marathon, and one YouTuber who competed was stunned by what he discovered in the country.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">North Korea is notoriously isolated from the rest of the world, but every April, it allows foreigners to compete in the Pyongyang Marathon.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The race, also known as the Mangyondae Prize International Marathon, first allowed foreign runners to participate in 2014 &#8212; 33 years after it was <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://rockyroadtravel.com/pyongyang-marathon-tours/#1">first founded in 1981</a>. A decade later, 27-year-old <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/">YouTuber</a> Harry Jaggard entered the competition and was shocked by what he saw.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Jaggard is a self-described &#8220;professional idiot completing side missions.&#8221; Boasting over 2 million subscribers, he records his travels in &#8220;less-visited areas of the world&#8221; like Syria and Papua New Guinea and shares his adventures online.</p>



 
 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In April 2025, Jaggard decided to cross North Korea off his list of travel destinations after the country finally opened its borders to tourists, having closed them for the last five years.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, he wasn&#8217;t visiting as a tourist; instead, he was running in the Pyongyang Marathon under the Amateur Athletics Association to experience North Korea&#8217;s capital city freely, without supervision.</p> 



<h2 id="h-youtuber-gets-unprecedented-view-of-north-korea-as-country-opens-to-tourists-for-first-time-in-5-years" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">YouTuber gets unprecedented view of North Korea as country opens to tourists for first time in 5 years</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Much to his surprise, he was allowed to film content for his channel without many restrictions, remarking at how easygoing the North Korean people and government were about his vlog.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I was not expecting [to be able to vlog] at all,&#8221; he said in a statement to the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/world-news/youtuber-uses-international-marathon-to-infiltrate-north-korea-i-left-with-1000-more-questions/">New York Post</a>. &#8220;I thought that it would be very minimal, maybe a few clips that I would voice over. To have the freedom that I was given was crazy. They were very relaxed.&#8221;</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That being said, he was keenly aware that he was only seeing the &#8216;perfect&#8217; parts of North Korea, describing it as a sort of &#8220;highlight reel.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;They showed us the tour that they wanted to show,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s like going on a tour of America but only seeing Las Vegas, like the shiny parts.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On his trip, Jaggard was stunned to see &#8220;modern houses,&#8221; &#8220;super clean&#8221; streets, and even bustling nightlife, visiting a beer house to sample some of the country&#8217;s local drinking fare.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I had so much fun, I&#8217;ve enjoyed every single minute of this tour,&#8221; he said in a vlog. &#8220;It&#8217;s been eye-opening, incredible, amazing.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Jaggard was even more impressed after completing the marathon, successfully running the 42km course in 3 hours and 40 minutes despite only training for one month.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, North Korea shut down tourism quickly following Jaggard&#8217;s trip for the marathon and suddenly canceled dozens of visas &#8211; something <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/cnc/date/2025-05-20/segment/12">CNN speculated</a> might have been a result of his vlog.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Overall, the YouTuber was thoroughly impressed by North Korea&#8217;s kind citizens, describing his interactions with them as &#8220;heartwarming&#8221; and making it clear that its people are far different from the country&#8217;s impression overseas.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;For me, the experience was more about the people that I met,&#8221; he told the Post. &#8220;They are portrayed to hate all foreigners and hate the West, but that&#8217;s not really true. We had so many interesting conversations off camera that were just very heartwarming.&#8221;</p>
