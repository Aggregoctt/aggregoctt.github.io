<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Twitch is making it much easier for one group of streamers to gain Partner status on the Amazon-owned platform after some complaints.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Attaining Partner status on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/">Twitch</a> opens up a world of possibilities for streamers. Being a Twitch Partner means you are able to get subscribers, access Twitch ad deals, and make money off the bounty board.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/twitch-makes-big-viewership-change-to-partner-goals-at-long-last-2917277/">The requirements for becoming a Partner have been tweaked a little bit over the years</a>, but it is all about being consistent in your streaming, building a fanbase, and dedicating yourself to Twitch.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, for Latin America streamers, it has been difficult to attain Partner status &#8211; especially Partner Plus. Twitch noted that this is due to &#8220;cultural nuances and economic realities in LATAM,&#8221; and, as a result, they&#8217;re making a big change.&#160;</p>



<h2 id="h-twitch-lowers-latam-requirements-for-partner" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Twitch lowers LATAM requirements for Partner</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That&#8217;s right, Twitch is now making it much easier for Latin American streamers to gain Partner status, halving the points required to do so.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Level 1, the 60/40 revenue share level, will now be attainable with 50 Plus Points for three consecutive months. This is down from the previous requirement of 100 Plus Points. Level 2, the 70/30 revenue share level, requires 200 Plus Points for three consecutive months. This is down from 300 Plus Points.&#160;&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The data we have tells us that cultural nuances and economic realities in LATAM have made it difficult for creators of similar size to meet Plus program requirements compared to those in other regions. Given this, we see an opportunity to better support creators in LATAM by making higher revenue shares more accessible,&#8221; Twitch <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1924515600371511590">said</a>.&#160;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Naturally, the change was welcomed by plenty of streamers. &#8220;This is amazing news,&#8221; one said. &#8220;Wow, what a thoughtful approach!&#8221; another added.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Amazon-owned platform noted that they are &#8220;committed to making more improvements that benefit our global creator community moving forward,&#8221; with creators from the United States and Europe asking if they&#8217;ll have their requirements reconsidered as well.</p>
