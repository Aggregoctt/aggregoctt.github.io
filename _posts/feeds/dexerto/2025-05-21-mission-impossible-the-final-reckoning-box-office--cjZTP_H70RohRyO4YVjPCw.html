<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Dead Reckoning (Part 1, which has since been axed from the title) was a great M:I movie, but it underperformed. Fallout grossed over $790 million, while its sequel made $571 million worldwide.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Issues with its Part 1 title and anything in the film itself aside, it was a victim of theatrical scheduling: it released one week before Barbie and Oppenheimer (aka Barbenheimer), the defining cinematic event of 2023, which also happened to take all of the IMAX screens. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In short, there&#8217;s no reason to believe <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/mission-impossible/">Mission: Impossible</a> 8 will flop; it&#8217;s the final entry, Tom Cruise is a bankable movie star, and it&#8217;s enjoyed a long, successful marketing rollout. However, it&#8217;s still a risk. </p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning is estimated to make between $70-80 million domestically in its opening weekend, though that figure could go as high as $100 million. </strong></p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Final Reckoning marks the first time the franchise has released a new movie over the Memorial Day weekend since Mission: Impossible 2, which opened with a four-day total of $70.8m (as per <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.boxofficepro.com/long-range-forecast-paramount-looks-for-memorial-day-magic-with-mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning/">Box Office Pro</a>).</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Its three predecessors &#8211; Dead Reckoning, Fallout, and Rogue Nation &#8211; all opened at number one, but they didn&#8217;t have a competitor like <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/lilo-and-stitch-remake-review-3197705/">Lilo and Stitch</a>, which has been attracting Disney&#8217;s strongest pre-sales since 2019&#8217;s The Lion King remake (which became one of the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/top-50-highest-grossing-movies-of-all-time-1856841/">highest-grossing movies ever made</a>).</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;ll be a great weekend for theaters regardless, as it may be one of the biggest Memorial Day weekends in box office history. The question is: how much will Lilo and Stitch affect Mission: Impossible? Fun fact: the original Lilo and Stitch opened on the same weekend as Minority Report in 2002.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Final Reckoning has a big advantage: it has exclusivity on IMAX screens for three weeks until the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/how-to-train-your-dragon-live-action-movie-release-date-cast-plot-2063071/">How to Train Your Dragon remake</a>, which could help retain sales and even lead to re-watches. </p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning reportedly has a budget of at least $400 million.</strong></p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://puck.news/the-untold-story-of-tom-cruises-career-resurrection/">Puck</a> newsletter published earlier in May, the film&#8217;s price tag is said to &#8220;start with a four (as in, hundred million)&#8230; [it&#8217;s] in contention for the most expensive movie ever made.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For the record, if we estimate Mission: Impossible 8&#8217;s budget at $400 million, this is where it&#8217;d rank among the priciest films ever made: </p>

<li>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker &#8211; $416 million</li>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It should be noted that it&#8217;s not an indulgent budget. Yes, Cruise&#8217;s bi-plane stunt and his underwater sequence will have cost a lot of money, as will the movie&#8217;s globetrotting plot, but The Final Reckoning was in development through the COVID pandemic, so it&#8217;s absorbed the costs of shutdowns and other restrictions. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One insider told the publication: &#8220;It&#8217;s a big, expensive movie &#8211; no doubt &#8211; but it has enormous value [beyond theatrical revenue]. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;d do it all over again.&#8221; </p> 



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-mission:-impossible-&#8211;-the-final-reckoning-need-to-break-even?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">How much does Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning need to break even?</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>Mission: Impossible &#8211; The Final Reckoning may need to make $1 billion to break even. </strong></p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That may seem a little confusing, but it&#8217;s generally believed that a movie needs to make 2.5x its budget to break even (consider all of the costs; fees to exhibitors, merchandising, taxes, and much more).</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, Mission: Impossible&#8217;s budget hasn&#8217;t been strictly confirmed, and that $400 million figure may include press and advertising costs, so it may be able to break even on a slightly smaller haul. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If it does crack the $1 billion barrier (which seems unlikely, given its current tracking and the fact Lilo and Stitch is projected to be the first billion-dollar movie of 2025), it&#8217;d be the biggest M:I movie ever. Here&#8217;s how much they&#8217;ve all made: </p>
