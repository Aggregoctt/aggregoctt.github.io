<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/borderlands/">Borderlands</a> publisher Take Two just dropped a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e8841ad4-15c4-4572-b4c4-0df5548df6ba">financial report;</a> turns out the franchise has sold a jaw-dropping 93 million copies.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That&#8217;s ninety-three million vault-hunting, loot-chasing, wisecrack-filled units. And with Borderlands 4 barreling toward launch, the hype train isn&#8217;t slowing down anytime soon.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fans are cautiously thrilled. The series, after all, has been a mixed bag over the years. Borderlands 2 is a genre classic, and although Borderlands 3 has its critics, it&#8217;s been defined as the franchise&#8217;s &#8220;fastest selling&#8221; entry.</p> 



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-has-big-shoes-to-fill-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Borderlands 4 has big shoes to fill&#160;&#160;</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Borderlands 4 wants redemption. A State of Play showcase revealed a new planet, Kairos, filled with rebellion, vertical terrain, and actual exploration. No minimap. Just a compass. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The new <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/all-vault-hunters-in-borderlands-4-3188972/">Vault Hunters</a> bring deep customization, unique skills, and, allegedly, real personality. Weapons now pull traits from multiple manufacturers, thanks to the &#8220;Licensed Parts&#8221; system. </p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Tone-wise, it&#8217;s dialing back toward the snarky sweet spot of Borderlands 2. A new team of writers promises punchier, smarter humor.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But the sales numbers are absolutely wild. Page 16 of 2K&#8217;s 2025 investor presentation confirmed it: Borderlands 3 has sold over 22 million units, making it the publisher&#8217;s fastest-seller ever. Borderlands 2 remains their all-time best-selling game at 30 million.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Tiny Tina&#8217;s Wonderlands didn&#8217;t get sales numbers, which probably says enough. But 40% of its players were brand-new to the series. Borderlands is still bringing in fresh blood.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">2K and Take-Two clearly see Borderlands as a key piece of their fiscal puzzle. It&#8217;s not just a looter-shooter anymore, it&#8217;s a cornerstone. The slick investor slides placed it prominently among the publisher&#8217;s top earners, a clear vote of confidence ahead of its next major release.</p>
