<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After almost a year, The Chi Season 7 is finally here &#8211; and if you want to watch it for free, there&#8217;s one way you can stream the premiere without paying anything. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Created by&#160;Lena Waithe, the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-netflix-shows-3130863/">binge-worthy TV show</a> first premiered on Showtime in January 2018. From its first season, the show follows &#8220;a fateful turn of events that sends shockwaves through a community on the Southside of Chicago and connects the lives of Emmett (Jacob Latimore), Brandon (Jason Mitchell), Ronnie (Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine), and Kevin (Alex R. Hibbert) in unexpected ways.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">After Season 6 shocked viewers by killing off Douda in the finale, the seventh season presents a big opportunity to the women of The Chi, who &#8220;rise to reclaim their power,&#8221; according to the official synopsis. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With Episode 1 premiering today (May 16), there&#8217;s a couple of ways you can watch it &#8211; and you may even be able to stream it for free. </p> 



<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-the-chi-season-7-for-free-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">How to watch The Chi Season 7 for free </h2>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><strong>You can watch the first episode of The Chi Season 7 for free with a seven-day free trial for Paramount+ with Showtime. </strong></p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Here&#8217;s the thing: The Chi drops new episodes online before their debut on normal TV. So, Episode 1 is now available to stream via a Paramount+ with Showtime subscription, but it airs on Showtime&#8217;s cable channel on Sundays at 9pm ET/PT. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Watching the show via Paramount+ is the quickest way to watch it, but if you already have cable and you&#8217;re willing to wait a couple of days, you can watch it for free already. </p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There are other options. For example, you can get a free trial for YouTube TV, but you&#8217;ll need to pay an extra cost for Showtime (unfortunately, the likes of Fubo and other cable streamers don&#8217;t offer Showtime by default). If you have a Sling subscription, you can add Paramount+ to your plan for just $5 for the first month. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Also, there are reportedly 12 episodes in The Chi Season 7. If you hold off until nearer the finale, you could bag a free trial and binge the series in one week.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While this can&#8217;t be guaranteed, Showtime has offered 30-day free trials in the past, so you may be lucky if you bide your time if you don&#8217;t want to pay anything right now. </p>
