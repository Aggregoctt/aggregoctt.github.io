<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Twitch is being slammed over a new feature that lets streamers &#8220;give back&#8221; to their communities by sending their money back to the platform.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 20, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/">Twitch</a> announced that it was testing a new program where streamers can buy Bits and gift subs with the money they make from broadcasting.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Give back to your community or support other streamers you love using your spendable balance,&#8221; the platform said.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, streamers and viewers on the Amazon-owned site were a bit baffled by this, especially because of how Twitch&#8217;s revenue split works, arguing that it could just end up generating more money for the platform.</p> 



 



<h2 id="h-streamers-accuse-twitch-of-&#8220;double-taxing&#8221;-them-with-new-feature" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Streamers accuse Twitch of &#8220;double taxing&#8221; them with new feature</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Immediately after the announcement was made, streamers began to argue that Twitch supposedly benefits more from this than viewers.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Wait, so: Chat donates 100 -&gt; 50 goes to Twitch. Creator uses the other 50 -&gt; 25 goes to Twitch. So 75 to Twitch, 25 to creators &amp; community?&#8221; streamer Sir Hans Vader <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/SirHansVader/status/1925170082658853114">questioned</a>. &#8220;Are you high?&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;You get double taxed (by Twitch) on your money viewers give you,&#8221; another <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/Celsusboltfire/status/1925316287720198405">said</a>. &#8220;Smaller content creators will be getting less payouts if they use this feature which means Twitch doesn&#8217;t have to pay as many processing fees.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;So people gift subs to support creators and you take 50%, then creators use their cut to buy bits or gift subs to support others and then Twitch takes ANOTHER 50%? That&#8217;s basically double taxing lmao,&#8221; commented ABYSS.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Kick co-founder Trainwreck also chimed in, accusing the platform of having streamers in a &#8220;a perpetual Stockholm syndrome.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, Twitch stars Knut and Nmp disagreed, pointing out that Twitch wasn&#8217;t making anyone use the feature.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I see a lot of people complaining. Just don&#8217;t use the money on Twitch if you don&#8217;t want to. No one is forcing you&#8230;. Stop complaining about things that isn&#8217;t a problem,&#8221; Knut said.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I think people at this point just enjoy complaining about sh*t that don&#8217;t matter in the slightest,&#8221; Nmp added.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We&#8217;ll have to see if Twitch decides to make some changes to how this feature is implemented to make it more appealing to creators.</p>
