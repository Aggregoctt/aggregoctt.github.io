<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rematch, the third-person perspective 5v5 soccer game, releases on June 19, but you can play early through the closed beta.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Developed by Sloclap, the studio that made <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/reviews/sifu-review-1756222/">Sifu</a>, Rematch has often been described as <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/rocket-league/">Rocket League</a> without cars. Instead of the top-down view you&#8217;d expect from a soccer game like <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/ea-sports-fc/">EA Sports FC</a>, it puts you in control of an individual player from the third person.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The first beta was a roaring success with 1.3M players signing up, so if you want to give it a try yourself, here&#8217;s how to play May&#8217;s closed beta. </p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Rematch closed beta runs from <strong>Wednesday, May 28, until Friday, May 30</strong>. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The last beta started at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET / 4 PM BST, but the devs haven&#8217;t revealed when this one starts yet. The last beta was also extended, so we&#8217;ll need to wait and see whether they do it again. </p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Rematch closed beta is available on <strong>PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</strong>. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The first beta was PC-only, but following a short console technical test on May 9, the next closed beta will include all platforms. It&#8217;s not clear whether it&#8217;ll have crossplay, though, with the devs unable to confirm whether it&#8217;ll be there at launch either.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a Discord message in April, one of the devs, nobugz, said, &#8220;we&#8217;re doing our best efforts to have cross platform Day 1 but I can&#8217;t confirm it yet unfortunately. If we don&#8217;t manage it at launch, it will be made available in an update very soon after &#8211; as soon as possible actually.&#8221;</p>
