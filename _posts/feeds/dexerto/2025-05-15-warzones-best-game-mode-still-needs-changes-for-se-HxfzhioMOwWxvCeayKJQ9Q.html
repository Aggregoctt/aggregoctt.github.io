<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Call of Duty: Warzone fans have, again, praised the battle royale&#8217;s casual mode but believe it still needs a big change to be made to it.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/warzone/">Warzone</a> first launched in 2020 as a part of Modern Warfare, it had the main battle royale mode, and Plunder. Since then, limited-time modes have become part and parcel of things.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Modern Warfare actually had some of the best, including Iron Trials, Vehicle Royale, and Mini Royale. There have been events for Godzilla and King Kong at times over the years, and even Resurgence overtook the main mode in popularity at times.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, it&#8217;s <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/black-ops-6/">Black Ops 6&#8217;</a>s take on things with Battle Royale Casual that has earned the most praise of any since Iron Trials. As the name suggests, it is a much more casual battle royale experience and removes a lot of the stress of a usual Warzone game. And, while fans love it, they&#8217;d also like some changes.&#160;</p> 



<h2 id="h-warzone-players-praise-casual-battle-royal-as-&#8220;best-thing&#8221;" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Warzone players praise casual battle royal as &#8220;best thing&#8221;</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">That&#8217;s right, the mode has been rightfully praised again as one of the &#8220;best things&#8221; that could have ever been added, but players would love a few tweaks.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Just need a solos playlist on it. Also, in quads, it&#8217;d be nice if the bots were squadded together,&#8221; one fan <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/1km44xy/still_the_best_thing_they_could_ever_add_for/">said</a>. &#8220;Solos for sure. Even Duos would be manageable,&#8221; another agreed.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I agree it&#8217;s beautiful, I wish there was one with a little bit better bots, though. The current ones are not even a threat to your plates,&#8221; another suggested. &#8220;I would like to see them add how many real players you&#8217;ve killed on the scoreboard,&#8221; another chimed in.&#160;</p>  



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Other players noted the inclusion of the casual mode &#8220;makes for less easy players to fight in regular BR,&#8221; and that has a knock-on effect with Ranked play too.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Obviously, only the devs can make tweaks to the mode, and it&#8217;d be interesting to see if they do. It is clearly popular.</p>
