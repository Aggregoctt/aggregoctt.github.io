<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The Overwatch 2 Street Fighter collab for one particular hero has left a bitter taste to fans due to one cosmetic.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-street-fighter-6-event-challenges-rewards-3197864/">Overwatch 2&#8217;s Street Fighter collab</a> is a much bigger undertaking than fans may have guessed. As Blizzard finally revealed through the official trailer, it&#8217;s bigger in scope than most crossovers we&#8217;ve seen prior. For the first time in forever, there&#8217;s a crossover that includes eight characters in one single wave, making it a huge addition to the game.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Much like previous collabs, though, it&#8217;s almost always <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-players-devastated-as-kiriko-mercy-get-more-skins-while-venture-rots-2864443/">expected that Kiriko would get her own skin</a>. This time, the support hero has received an all-new makeover based on Juri from the popular fighting game franchise.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Though her getting a new skin isn&#8217;t exactly surprising, there&#8217;s one thing that has caught many off guard and even left them disappointed: that being her highlight intro.</p>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-2-fans-slam-kiriko&#8217;s-street-fighter-highlight-intro" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Overwatch 2 fans slam Kiriko&#8217;s Street Fighter highlight intro</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Included in Kiriko&#8217;s bundle is a highlight intro called Time to Play, which has her riding a motorcycle and maneuvering it by sliding sideways, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/kiriko-bike-overwatch-2-akira-mod-ultimate-ability-1993649/">a nod to the famous scene</a> from the Akira anime. The problem with this is that this particular intro has already been given to Tracer before.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you&#8217;re wearing the Juri skin, the animation at the end does slightly differ. However, as a user showcased in a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1krcvel/blizzard_reused_a_tracer_highlight_intro_for_the/">Reddit thread</a>, Kiriko can be seen doing the exact animation as Tracer&#8217;s highlight intro when equipping other skins.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It also doesn&#8217;t help that the overall angle and bike effects are essentially the same, leading to fans expressing their disappointment to the point some people are calling it an &#8220;asset flip.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I knew it looked familiar. Also, they&#8217;re getting too comfortable if they think this is something they get to do,&#8221; said one person.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Another pointed out: &#8220;They couldn&#8217;t even remove the Tracer logos from the bike, let alone reskin it to match Juri&#8217;s black and pink one from the SF6 cutscene they&#8217;re referencing. It&#8217;s the total re-use of a Tracer asset with no shame and no attempt to alter it that&#8217;s the issue.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Seeing this, one user joked: &#8220;The first time we see her on a bike and it&#8217;s not hers. Lol,&#8221; referring to Kiriko&#8217;s in-game voice line that says: &#8220;Wait till you see me on my bike.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">This isn&#8217;t the first time players have spotted highlight intros being used for other heroes. Tracer&#8217;s Lion Dance highlight intro was also previously given to Mei and Lucio.</p>
