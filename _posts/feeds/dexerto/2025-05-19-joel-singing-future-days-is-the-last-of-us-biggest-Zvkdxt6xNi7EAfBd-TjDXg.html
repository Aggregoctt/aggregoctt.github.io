<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">We finally got Joel playing the guitar and singing &#8216;Future Days&#8217; to Ellie in <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-3176859/">The Last of Us Season 2</a> Episode 6, but here&#8217;s the thing: it doesn&#8217;t make any sense. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The newest episode of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/the-last-of-us/">The Last of Us</a> focuses almost exclusively on Joel and Ellie in the years before Season 2, exploring how their relationship turned sour as Ellie got older and grew wise to his lie(s). </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Before we get to what happened with <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-2-eugene-explained-3177656/">Eugene</a> and their fateful talk on the porch after the barn dance, we see them celebrating Ellie&#8217;s 15th birthday in Jackson. Joel trades his way to a cake (baked by <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/why-the-last-of-us-fans-are-angry-about-seth-after-episode-3-3186288/">Seth</a>, of all people) and refurbs a &#8220;gee-tar&#8221; as a present. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">She asks him to play and sing something, and while he&#8217;s reluctant at first, he lands on &#8216;Future Days&#8217; by Pearl Jam. It&#8217;s a wonderful, emotional moment ever-so-slightly retooled from the game, but there&#8217;s something wrong with it that you probably haven&#8217;t realized.</p> 



<h2 id="h-why-&#8216;future-days&#8217;-doesn&#8217;t-make-sense-in-the-last-of-us" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Why &#8216;Future Days&#8217; doesn&#8217;t make sense in The Last of Us</h2>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8216;Future Days&#8217; was released in October 2013. In The Last of Us, the Cordyceps outbreak began on September 26, 2003. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In other words, the song came out over 10 years after Outbreak Day. Unless Pearl Jam survived the pandemic and still had the facilities to make and release new music on a wide scale, &#8216;Future Days&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t exist within the world of the show &#8211; so, why would Joel sing it? </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In defence of the original game, the outbreak originally started in 2013, so it&#8217;s not too much of a stretch for Joel to know it by the time we reach this moment in Part 2. </p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Also, it&#8217;s just a fun continuity error. The song has thematic weight in the context of The Last of Us&#8217; story (&#8220;If I ever were to lose you, I&#8217;d surely lose myself,&#8221; sums up Joel&#8217;s actions at the end of Season 1 and how violent Ellie becomes in her pursuit of Abby), and more importantly, the showrunners simply don&#8217;t care about the song&#8217;s chronology. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Neil [Druckmann] and I had, you know, a solid conversation and arrived at the following conclusion: We didn&#8217;t give a sh*t because it is an important song to the story,&#8221; Craig Mazin said on the show&#8217;s official podcast. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;And thematically, it&#8217;s incredibly important because Joel is trying to figure out what his future is with Ellie, and Ellie is trying to figure out what her future is as herself, not as someone&#8217;s kid. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;And where they&#8217;re heading into the future, which we accelerate them into five years later, they have arrived at &#8216;Future Days&#8217;. It is, in fact, the past that is the anchor that is still holding them back.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At the end of the day, The Last of Us is fictional; if the showrunners want to include a song because it means a lot to fans and feels emotionally appropriate, why shouldn&#8217;t they? </p>
