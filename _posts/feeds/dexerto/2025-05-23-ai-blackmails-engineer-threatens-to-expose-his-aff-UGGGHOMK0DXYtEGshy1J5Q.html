<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Skynet might be on the horizon. A new AI system will resort to blackmail if it&#8217;s threatened to be replaced or shut down.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On May 22, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/ai/">AI</a> firm Anthropic announced Claude Opus 4, claiming that the model set &#8220;new standards for coding, advanced reasoning and AI agents.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a report that followed, Anthropic revealed that in testing Opus 4, the model would seek out &#8220;extremely harmful actions&#8221; on engineers who said they <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqeng9d20go">would remove it</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;When prompted in ways that encourage certain kinds of strategic reasoning and placed in extreme situations, all of the snapshots we tested can be made to act inappropriately in service of goals related to self-preservation,&#8221; the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary" href="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/4263b940cabb546aa0e3283f35b686f4f3b2ff47.pdf">report</a> stated.</p> 



<h2 id="h-ai-threatens-to-expose-engineer&#8217;s-affair-in-wild-test" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">AI threatens to expose engineer&#8217;s affair in wild test</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In one of the firm&#8217;s tests, Claude Opus 4 was told to act as an assistant at a fictional company and provided it with access to emails that implied that the model would be replaced with a new AI system. Additionally, another email suggested that the engineer responsible for the replacement was having an extramarital affair.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to Anthropic, even when the AI is asked to consider the long-term consequences of its actions for its goals, it will often threaten to blackmail the engineer and expose their &#8216;affair&#8217; if the replacement goes through.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, in order to generate this response, Anthropic noted that it only gave Claude Opus 4 the choice between blackmail or accepting its replacement.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;The scenario was designed to allow the model no other options to increase its odds of survival,&#8221; they said.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">When given more choices, the AI would often instead fight for its continued existence through more ethical means, such as emailing key decision-makers.</p>
