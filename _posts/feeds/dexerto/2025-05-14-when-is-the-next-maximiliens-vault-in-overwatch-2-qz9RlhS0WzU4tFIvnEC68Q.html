<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Maximilien&#8217;s Vault gives <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/">Overwatch 2</a> players the chance to get shiny new skins for their heroes at a discounted price, but when is the next one? </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Collecting skins for your favorite heroes is a key part of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a>, but it&#8217;s easy to miss out if you&#8217;re not playing regularly. With so many <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-gundam-wing-collab-3181877/">events</a> and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-street-fighter-6-crossover-skins-heroes-release-date-more-3193428/">collaborations</a> to keep track of, it&#8217;s almost impossible for most players to unlock every outfit when it&#8217;s released. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The return of loot boxes has made life easier, but their random nature means you often get items for heroes you rarely use. Luckily, Maximilien&#8217;s Vault offers another chance to get Legendary skins you might have missed for the characters you use. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-maximilien&#8217;s-vault-return?-" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">When does Maximilien&#8217;s Vault return? </h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Blizzard don&#8217;t announce when Maximilien&#8217;s Vault is coming to the shop, but it will be during <strong>Season 17</strong>. This means it will be sometime <strong>between June 24, 2025, and mid to late August</strong>, based on past OW2 seasons running for around eight weeks. </p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Although it&#8217;s not tied to a fixed schedule, it does drop once every single season and last for seven days. After first arriving in Season 14, the feature has made a comeback in both Season 15 and 16, so the next one should never be too far away. </p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">To help you keep track, here&#8217;s a breakdown of when each Maximilien&#8217;s Vault has appeared so far:</p> 



 



<h2 id="h-what-is-maximilien&#8217;s-vault-in-ow2?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">What is Maximilien&#8217;s Vault in OW2?</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Maximilien&#8217;s Vault is a shop feature that offers you five random skins at a discounted price between 15% and 60%. When you first open it, you&#8217;re presented with five cards, and selecting each one reveals an Epic or Legendary skin and a random discount. </p>  


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The five skins are unique for each player, as the feature is supposed to offer &#8220;personalized discounts on hero skins tailored to your playstyle,&#8221; according to the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24166122/season-14-midseason-classic-fun-deadly-elegance-and-lunar-mischief/">devs</a>. This means that you should see cosmetics for your most-played characters more often. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, there have been <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-players-say-new-personalized-shop-options-arent-personalized-at-all-3037991/">complaints</a>, as fans have <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-players-convinced-maximiliens-vault-is-completely-broken-3157884/">reported seeing nothing for their preferred heroes</a> and plenty of skins for characters they&#8217;ve spent a handful of matches with. Unfortunately, Blizzard haven&#8217;t officially revealed how the outfits are selected, so you&#8217;ll just need to keep your fingers crossed.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ultimately, you don&#8217;t have to buy the outfits you&#8217;re presented with, but it&#8217;s a nice way to unlock Legendary cosmetics from past crossovers that you may have missed the first time around.</p>
