<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Kim Ha-rin has proven to be one of the most divisive <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-devils-plan-season-2-death-game-cast-contestants-netflix-3189934/">contestants of The Devil&#8217;s Plan Season 2</a>, but after the latest chapter of the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> competition show, her fans are fighting back.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Following the first chapter in 2023, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-devils-plan-rules-explained-netflix-2308902/">The Devil&#8217;s Plan</a> has made its triumphant return, with a host of tricky new main matches and prison challenges. Along the way, the players are tasked with collecting as many pieces as they can.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">At the end, the contestant with the most pieces wins the game &#8211; including a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-devils-plan-prize-season-2-winner-fund-explained-3192685/">whopping cash prize</a> of up to 500 million won ($356k). In Season 2, officially subtitled Death Room, the player count has been bumped up to 14.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The pool includes celebs like <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/singles-inferno-season-4-netflix-hosts-3031805/">Single&#8217;s Inferno host</a> Kyuhyun and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/beef-cast-all-actors-characters-cast-netflix-series-2103602/">Beef star</a> Justin H.

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Despite proving to be a tactical, smart player, Kim Ha-rin was <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-devils-plan-season-2-winners-eliminations-match-results-3190302/">eliminated in The Devil&#8217;s Plan Season 2</a> Part 2. Viewers are now taking to social media to praise her after she received hate comments online.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">For context, following the debut of the second chapter, the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/new-netflix-shows-3058259/">Netflix show&#8217;s</a> subreddit saw posts <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDevilsPlan/comments/1kh8u5o/harin_is_annoying/">saying</a> things like, &#8220;Ha-rin is annoying,&#8221; <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDevilsPlan/comments/1kh6vgq/harin/">and</a> that &#8220;she is manipulative&#8221; and &#8220;unsettling.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In response, one fan <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDevilsPlan/comments/1kit0la/i_love_harin/">wrote</a>, &#8220;I love Ha-rin. The hate towards her is so funny, because if she was a man people would be praising her for how smart and strategic she is, but they hate seeing a woman play ruthlessly like their favorite male players do, instead of being all smiley and not taking any initiatives.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;&#8216;She&#8217;s selfish because she&#8217;s trying to win for herself&#8217;, it&#8217;s almost like that&#8217;s the point of the game&#8230; they&#8217;re all here to win, not make friends. I also saw many people saying she has a villainous face LMAO the misogyny couldn&#8217;t be any clearer.&#8221;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Another agreed, &#8220;I think that she deserves to get far, possibly top five. She has shown throughout the matches that she has what it takes to win.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I am biased due to my soft spot for Justin, but I can recognize good gameplay. I also think that some of the Ha-rin criticism is arguably valid but I don&#8217;t think it warrants some of the attacks I&#8217;ve seen on this subreddit.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A third added, &#8220;How is her play even ruthless? It&#8217;s just normal gameplay, I don&#8217;t know how people are saying she&#8217;s aggressive.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In a separate post, one fan <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDevilsPlan/comments/1km1q9x/i_dont_get_you_people/">commented</a>, &#8220;I came to watch this show for the liars, the cutthroaters, the backstabbing, and the betrayal. I am enjoying the double dealing through and through.&#8221;</p>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Exactly, I will never understand why people watch these shows and hate the &#8216;villains&#8217;, I love them, even if I love the nice ones too,&#8221; said a second.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;These people are the same that love all <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-sci-fi-movies-2817352/">sci fi movies</a> talking about revolutions and then are conservative. Like the message goes over their head every time.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">But even if you love Ha-rin&#8217;s tactics, sadly you won&#8217;t be able to watch her compete anymore, as she was eliminated in the third prison match.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Although she hasn&#8217;t shared an update on her social media channels, Ha-rin will be going home and continuing her career as a plastic surgeon.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In her final solo interview on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-devils-plan-season-2-netflix-viewers-complaint-contestants-3191419/">The Devil&#8217;s Plan Season 2</a>, she discusses the gruelling work she went through to earn her credentials, even forfeiting TV as a child.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Appearing on the Netflix show was &#8220;the first time in my life that I prioritized a passion over an obligation, something that I wanted to do, and I had the time of my life,&#8221; she says tearfully.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you want to keep tabs on Ha-rin&#8217;s moves after the series, you can follow her on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.instagram.com/harinn_nn/">Instagram</a>.&#160;</p>
