<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over the last few years, IShowSpeed has become one of the biggest streamers on the planet. He initially started out by playing FIFA (now EA SPORTS FC), chatting on Omegle, and reacting to videos. However, his content has become a lot crazier since.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">His<a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/ishowspeed-breaks-another-huge-youtube-milestone-amid-china-stream-chaos-3168486/"> recent growth has been helped by some massive streaming tours</a>.

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There have been requests from fans for him to travel to countries that he has missed off so far. Speed has obliged with a few of those, traveling to Australia, New Zealand, and China at times. However, it looks like he won&#8217;t be streaming from Canada anytime soon.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The YouTube streaming star was asked about traveling to the Great White North during his May 12 stream, but revealed that it isn&#8217;t going to happen out of respect to his family.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Toronto? Chat, I told y&#8217;all chat. My grandad got killed by a Canadian, bro. That&#8217;s why, out of respect, I don&#8217;t think I will. Chat, maybe I&#8217;ll go to Canada, but out of respect for my grandad, I just don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s, like&#8230; you know what I&#8217;m saying?&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speed expanded on it when Bayern Munich and Canada defender Alphonso Davies joined him on stream for a game of EA FC 25.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;Back in the war, a Canadian killed my grandpa,&#8221; he said before being asked if he was being &#8220;serious&#8221; about it. &#8220;Yeah, man. I&#8217;m sorry to kill the vibe like that. Like, the vibe kinda got killed by that. That&#8217;s the reason I didn&#8217;t really want to bring it up.&#8221;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The YouTuber has already promised fans a handful of other tours, including returning to Peru, where he was named an ambassador.&#160;</p>
