<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It was only a matter of time before someone cracked open the Hellmouth again. That time has come, with a pilot order from Hulu set to revive the supernatural <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-horror-tv-shows-2918563/">horror series</a>, which finished its seven-season run in 2003.&#160;</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Although she&#8217;s only 15 years old, Armstrong has many acting credits to her name, including the recent <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> series <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/skeleton-crew-was-brilliant-but-its-probably-getting-canceled-and-its-your-fault-3032363/">Skeleton Crew</a>, in which she played Fern. Her first big role was as Minnie May Barry in the 2017 drama series Anne with an E.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">She made her big screen debut at age eight, starring in the 2019 comedy drama The Art of Racing in the Rain, alongside <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/kevin-costner/">Kevin Costner</a>, Milo Ventimiglia, Amanda Seyfried, and Gary Cole.</p>

At 11, she became the youngest actor to be in the main cast of <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/american-horror-story/">American Horror Story</a>, having played the child prodigy Alma Gardner in Double Feature.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While Armstrong was born in New York, her parents are Canadian. Her father is actor-producer Dean Armstrong, best known for playing Blake Wyzecki in Queer as Folk and appearing in shows like <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/sullivans-crossing-season-3-did-sully-die-3192780/">Sullivan&#8217;s Crossing</a> and Supernatural.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With a background in both acting and producing, Dean&#8217;s resume spans TV, film, and stage, so it&#8217;s no surprise Ryan caught the performance bug early.</p>

<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While the big details of the Buffyverse show are being kept under wraps, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/buffy-reboot-ryan-kiera-armstrong-new-slayer-1236398811/">Deadline</a> revealed that she will be playing the main slayer and that her character is described as an &#8220;introverted high-school student.&#8221;</p>



 
 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The outlet also stated that Sarah Michelle Gellar is reprising her role as Buffy Summers, while also serving as executive producer. She celebrated Armstrong&#8217;s arrival by sharing a clip on Instagram in which she breaks the good news.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;How do you feel about helping me save the world?&#8230; You wanna be my Chosen One?&#8221; she says, to which Armstrong excitedly replies, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Speaking about her new co-star, Gellar said, &#8220;From the moment I saw Ryan&#8217;s audition, I knew there was only one girl that I wanted by my side.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;To have that kind of emotional intelligence and talent at such a young age is truly a gift. The bonus is that her smile lights up even the darkest room.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Writers Lilla and Nora Zuckerman also said in a shared statement, &#8220;We are so overjoyed to have found this generation&#8217;s slayer in Ryan Kiera Armstrong, she absolutely blew us away &#8211; there is no question in our mind that she is the Chosen One.&#8221;</p>
