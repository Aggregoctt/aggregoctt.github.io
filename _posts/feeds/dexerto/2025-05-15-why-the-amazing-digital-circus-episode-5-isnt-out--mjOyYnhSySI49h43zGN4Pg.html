<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-amazing-digital-circus-netflix-voice-cast-rotten-tomatoes-2921538/">The Amazing Digital Circus</a> is an absurd fever dream of a show (in the best way possible), proving to be a viral hit when it debuted in 2023 and even <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/disturbing-youtube-cartoon-the-amazing-digital-circus-coming-to-netflix-2907488/">landing a deal with Netflix</a>. So, where is Episode 5?</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Chances are you&#8217;ve heard the name, or you&#8217;re one of 373 million people who watched the pilot episode on YouTube. From Glitch Productions, The Amazing Digital Circus is based on an incredibly simple yet highly effective premise: a group of humans trapped inside a <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/vr/">virtual reality</a> game.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Ripped straight from our nightmares, the VR game is circus-themed, kicking off with the most recent entrapped individual, Pomni (voiced by Lizzie Freeman). It&#8217;s like ReBoot took edibles and wandered into Don&#8217;t Hug Me I&#8217;m Scared.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Not only did it become the most watched <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-animated-movies-2569318/">animated</a> pilot in YouTube history, but in 2024, after the third episode dropped, the show landed a deal to be aired simultaneously on <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a>. Only one more has been added since then, and there&#8217;s a simple reason why.</p> 



<h2 id="h-where-is-the-amazing-digital-circus-episode-5?" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Where is The Amazing Digital Circus Episode 5?</h2>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no official release date just yet &#8211; and fans might be waiting a little longer than expected. While it&#8217;s easy to assume something big is around the corner (especially with that Netflix deal in play), the reality is far more human: the creators are busy.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Glitch Productions may now be collaborating with the world&#8217;s biggest <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/best-streaming-services-2641341/">streaming service</a>, but it&#8217;s still a relatively small team making high-quality animation with tight turnarounds.&#160;</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">What&#8217;s more, creator Gooseworx shared in a social media post, which appears to have been removed, that she&#8217;s feeling burned out. &#8220;I think I might be burning out, boys,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;The creative energy I need to be giving these episodes just isn&#8217;t there right now, and I can&#8217;t focus for sh*t.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;I&#8217;d take a break, but I&#8217;m already so far behind that I&#8217;m blocking entire departments. Kinda failing the team right now, and that&#8217;s stressing me the f**k out.&#8221; Fans shared their support, with one <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDigitalCircus/comments/1jyyc0m/new_gooseworx_post/#lightbox">writing</a>, &#8220;Oh that&#8217;s concerning,&#8221; and another stating, &#8220;Hope she gets some rest for real.&#8221;</p> 



<h2 id="h-glitch-productions-drops-new-show" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Glitch Productions drops new show</h2>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">There&#8217;s another reason for the delay: the team is juggling multiple projects. Most notably, Glitch&#8217;s next big animated series The Gaslight District made its recent debut and demands a lot of the same creative energy.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As the company <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/glitch_prod/status/1900623325811884045">shared</a> back in March this year, &#8220;Thank you for patiently waiting for more Digital Circus! We&#8217;re working hard on Episode 5 as we write this and are so excited to show you guys. But as we&#8217;re just one animation studio working on multiple shows, it will still be some time before the next episode is ready.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">&#8220;HOWEVER, we are alllllllmost ready to release the pilot of our new show; The Gaslight District &#8211; which you&#8217;re going to start hearing more about very, very soon. We can&#8217;t wait to release this. This show is like nothing we&#8217;ve EVER seen before and every inch of it was made with the love and passion of all our artists!&#8221;</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">What we know for sure is that the team are planning on eventually releasing nine episodes of The Amazing Digital Circus and Netflix will be airing them all when they&#8217;re ready.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, while you wait, you&#8217;ll have to make do with the four that are available, as well as The Gaslight Direct, which can be viewed on Glitch&#8217;s YouTube channel.&#160;</p>
