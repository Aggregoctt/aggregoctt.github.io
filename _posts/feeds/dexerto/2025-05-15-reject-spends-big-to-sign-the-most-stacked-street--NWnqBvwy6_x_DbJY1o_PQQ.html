<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Japanese esports org REJECT just made the biggest set of roster moves in fighting game history, signing several top-tier players and putting them all under one banner for Street Fighter.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While Street Fighter is popular globally and dwarfs every other title at major tournaments in terms of entrants, it&#8217;s especially popular in Japan. Big names like Daigo, Tokido, and Fuudo are genuine celebrities there and are still competing despite all three of them being middle-aged at this point.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">And, as it so happens, Japanese esports org REJECT has opted to sign all three of them at the same time, along with the now-former DRX player Leshar who took third at <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/street-fighter/15-year-old-street-fighter-6-prodigy-wins-100k-at-capcom-cup-11-final-3158460/">Capcom Cup 11</a>.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Growing their full roster of Street Fighter players out to seven, this is the most an organization has ever invested in a single game within the FGC. It&#8217;s <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/street-fighter/">Street Fighter</a> history in the making.</p>



<h2 id="h-reject-make-historic-street-fighter-6-roster-moves" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">REJECT make historic Street Fighter 6 roster moves</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In an announcement video, it was confirmed that REJECT would not only be renewing SF legend Tokido&#8217;s contract through the 2025 Street Fighter League, they were signing three new players: Daigo, Fuudo, and Leshar.</p> 



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/street-fighter/daigo-says-street-fighter-6-is-keeping-him-young-at-43-years-old-2835682/">Daigo</a> almost needs no introduction at this point. He&#8217;s been competing since 1998 and has found his resolve, going completely sober in 2025 and focusing on Street Fighter fully to try and win more titles before he retires.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Fuudo is in a similar boat, still competing at 39. He&#8217;s still a force to be reckoned with in Street Fighter 6 and has had top-tier placements at multiple majors through both 2024 and 2025, really leveling up his play and getting consistent podium finishes.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Leshar is the unique one here, a relatively young Korean player who&#8217;s been taking over the circuit since Ed game out. He&#8217;s one of the best in the world at playing this deeply technical character and has cemented himself as one of the biggest up-and-comers in the scene.</p>


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">These four players join AngryBird, BigBird, and Akira, three competitors who consistently podium finish at major events, to create the most stacked Street Fighter roster ever devised. The FGC has never seen a show of force like this all focused on one game. </p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It&#8217;s at the point where one of REJECT&#8217;s biggest worries should be players teamkilling each other in bracket and knocking each other out at majors.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It isn&#8217;t known just how much it cost to get all of these players united under one banner, but it certainly wasn&#8217;t cheap to buy out the world&#8217;s best talent all at once. The fact that one org is willing to invest so heavily in the future of Street Fighter is a good sign for both the Street Fighter League and fighting game esports as a whole.</p>
