<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">The <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/pokemon-tcg/">Pokemon TCG</a>&#8216;s upcoming expansion, Black Bolt and White Flair, will reportedly see some severe shortages when it releases, with some stores receiving absolutely no product.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">A new <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/pokemon-tcg-release-2629243/">Pokemon TCG expansion</a> isn&#8217;t exactly anything new. New expansions and cards are regularly dropped, like the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/pokemon-tcg-fans-should-brace-for-prismatic-evolutions-stock-shortages-3021934/">infamous Prismatic Evolutions</a>. When that release, we saw <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/retailer-accused-of-scalping-pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-set-by-their-own-staff-3062554/">scalpers dive in to buy up all the product</a> and sell it at a higher price, fans reported broken packs, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/pokemon-tcg-scammers-cost-collectors-crazy-six-figure-sum-in-just-one-month-3058948/">collectors got scammed</a> as they desperately tried to grab whatever they could, and plenty of the community ended up disappointed.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It seems, alongside all the above issues, the upcoming expansion, Black Bolt and White Flair will see some major shortages. But it&#8217;s all part of The Pokemon Company&#8217;s plan.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-pokemon-company-limits-black-bolt-and-white-flare-stock" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">The Pokemon Company limits Black Bolt&#160;and&#160;White Flare&#160;stock</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As initially reported by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/05/black-bolt-and-white-flare-to-experience-severe-shortages-but-tpci-now-catching-up">Pokebeach</a>, who spoke to distributors of the upcoming set, the Black Bolt&#160;and&#160;White Flare&#160;allocations for stores will be considerably less than&#160;that of Prismatic Evolutions. In fact, it will be so severe that most stores won&#8217;t end up receiving the product at all.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">According to the distributor, TPCi, this is an intentional move from The Pokemon Company, who are seeking to do this so they can catch up on the older and equally as in-demand sets, like <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/most-expensive-pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-cards-2975641/">Surging Sparks</a> and even Prismatic Evolutions. Both of which were met with plenty of stock issues and scalping.</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, on one hand, it&#8217;s going to be a real challenge to get hold of the Black Bolt&#160;and&#160;White Flare Pokemon TCG expansion in July. Luckily, unless you&#8217;re intending on buying it on release day, you&#8217;ll be able to get the product later on in the year, as sets are constantly printed for two years.</p>  



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On the other hand, this means the expansion will be a prime target for scalpers as players swarm to buy the extremely limited stock.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Nevertheless, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/pokemon-tcg-release-2629243/">previous expansions</a> will become more available during this time, so it&#8217;s perfect if you need to catch up on a few sets or grab a few previously limited cards.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">How this impacts the release of Black Bolt&#160;and&#160;White Flare remains to be seen, but given the extremely limited stock, it&#8217;s likely it&#8217;ll get chaotic fast.</p>
