<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In Counter-Strike 2, winning championships and pulling off clutch plays isn&#8217;t the only way to flex. For some pro players, their inventory is just as eye-catching as their skill. From rare knives and weapon skins to iconic stickers worth more than a luxury car, professional players have turned their inventories into showcases of both personal taste and pure value.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">With the <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/counter-strike-2/most-expensive-cs2-csgo-skins-1340162/">CS2 skin market</a> booming more than ever in 2025, some of the biggest stars in the game have assembled impressive collections, some worth over six figures. Whether it&#8217;s Twistzz&#8217;s iconic Wild Lotus plastered with Reason Gaming stickers, or ZywOo&#8217;s flashy AWP plays with the flashiest of AWPs, these players know how to combine style with firepower.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In partnership with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://skin.club/en?utm_source=serm&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=DEXERTO">Skin.club</a>, we&#8217;re diving into the Top 10 most expensive inventories owned by CS2 pro players, and highlighting some of their standout skins.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Skin.club is one of the leading case opening sites, very connected to the esports scene, including partnerships with professional teams like Vitality and The MongolZ.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">If you have your eye on any of the skins these pro players have in their collections, Skin.club offers users the chance to unbox rare skins, or even upgrade your current skins for higher-tier counterparts.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">It should be noted that some of these skins will not be owned by these pros, and instead borrowed to them from other high-tier collectors. But all the same, we&#8217;re calculating the highest total value in each inventory.</p>



<h2 id="h-top-10-cs2-pro-player-loadouts" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Top 10 CS2 pro player loadouts</h2>



<h3 id="h-10:-ropz-&#8211;-$36,000-inventory-(tied)" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-3 wp-block-heading">10: ropz &#8211; $36,000 inventory (Tied)</h3>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Team Vitality&#8217;s newest star, Robin &#8216;ropz&#8217; Kool has always been into skins, but he&#8217;s keeping his inventory pretty low-key right now.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Much of the value in his collection comes from his knife and glove combo. He rocks a Ruby Karambit and max red Crimson Kimono Specialist Gloves &#8211; a combo that will set you back over $20,000. He doesn&#8217;t currently have many super high-tier skins though, with his most impressive being a Glock Fade, M4 Hot Rod, and Desert Eagle Blaze.</p>  



<h3 id="h-10:-m0nesy-&#8211;-$36,000-inventory-(tied)" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-3 wp-block-heading">10: m0NESY &#8211; $36,000 inventory (Tied)</h3>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">m0NESY&#8217;s inventory is currently private, but we can see the most recent public version from March 2025, which boasts approximately $36,000 worth of skins.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Among his flashiest items is the AWP Dragon Lore, which is kitted out with four different Katowice 2014 Holo stickers, including a $70,000 Titan Holo.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He also has an incredibly valuable knife, the Nomad Knife Case Hardened Blue Gem. The exact value of this knife is hard to determine, but it&#8217;s likely over $10,000 alone.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">His other knife is a Ruby Butterfly Knife, which he is often seen using in combination with his Vice Gloves, which are in Minimal Wear condition.</p>



<h3 id="h-9:-niko-&#8211;-$41,000-inventory" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-3 wp-block-heading">9: NiKo &#8211; $41,000 inventory</h3>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Like ropz, NiKo&#8217;s inventory value is mostly tied up in his knives and gloves. He too has a pair of Crimson Kimono Specialist gloves, which he pairs with an Emerald Karambit. He also has a Vanilla Butterfly knife.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Some of NiKo&#8217;s iconic weapon skins include his &#8220;juaNiKo&#8217; Desert Eagle Blaze, a Glock Fade, and AK-47 Vulcan.</p> 



<h3 id="h-8:-karrigan-&#8211;-$47,000-inventory" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-3 wp-block-heading">8: Karrigan &#8211; $47,000 inventory</h3>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Karrigan&#8217;s knife of choice is a Ruby Butterfly Knife, and he is pairing that with Field-Tested Pandora&#8217;s Box gloves. Despite being Field-Tested, these rare gloves are worth over $10,000.&#160;</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Some of his other skins include an M9 Bayonet Marble Fade, a Karambit Slaughter, an AK-47 Fire Serpent, and an AWP Lightning Strike.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Over on Skin.club, you can open <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://skin.club/en/cases/open/eco-rush-b?utm_source=serm&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=DEXERTO">Karrigan&#8217;s choice cases</a>, including the &#8216;Eco Rush B&#8217; Case, which features a Glock Fade.</p> 



<h3 id="h-7:-rain-&#8211;-$58,000-inventory" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-3 wp-block-heading">7: rain &#8211; $58,000 inventory</h3>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Karrigan&#8217;s teammate rain has an even more valuable skins collection. He also has Field-Tested Pandora&#8217;s Box gloves, as well as a Karambit Ruby, and Phase 2 Doppler Butterfly Knife and M9 Bayonet.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">As for his weapons, he&#8217;s rocking a StatTrak FT Fire Serpent AK-47, which will set you back over $2,000, as well as Glock Fade and Desert Eagle Blaze.</p>



<h3 id="h-6:-zywoo-&#8211;-$71,000-inventory" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-3 wp-block-heading">6: zywOo &#8211; $71,000 inventory</h3>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Just outside the top 5 most expensive pro player inventories in CS2 is French phenom zywOo.&#160;</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Rocking a $20,000 Ruby Butterfly Knife, and owning not one, but two AWP Gungnirs, the Vitality star has some serious value stored in skins.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Other items in his collection include an M4 Fade, Glock Fade, and Desert Eagle Ocean Drive.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">On Skin.club, you can open <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://skin.club/en/cases/open/sniper-case?utm_source=serm&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=DEXERTO">Vitality&#8217;s Sniper choice case</a>, which includes an AWP Fade as the high-tier reward.</p>



<h3 id="h-5:-b1t-&#8211;-$92,000-inventory" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-3 wp-block-heading">5: b1t &#8211; $92,000 inventory</h3>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">NaVi&#8217;s headshot machine b1t clearly loves his skins, with an inventory just shy of $100,000 in value. In addition to his Ruby Butterfly Knife and Emerald Karambit, he has two of the highest-tier weapon skins in the game.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">First up is the AK-47 Wild Lotus, which is in Minimal Wear condition and costs about 17 grand. And, for the CT side, he&#8217;s popping heads with a Factory New M4A4 Howl, worth around $10,000.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He also has a bunch more knives and gloves, plus a Glock Emerald, M4 Hot Rod, Glock Fade, and a Desert Eagle Blaze.</p> 



<h3 id="h-4:-jl-&#8211;-$99,000" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-3 wp-block-heading">4: jL &#8211; $99,000</h3>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">b1t&#8217;s teammate jL just has him pipped for the most expensive inventory on NaVi, and it&#8217;s largely thanks to the Lithuanian&#8217;s absurd gloves collection.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While you can only wear one pair at a time, jL&#8217;s inventory has Hedge Maze, Pandora&#8217;s Box, Vice, Emerald Web, and Superconductor gloves &#8211; with a total value of more than $30,000.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In addition to all these gloves, jL also owns an AWP Gungnir, Black Pearl Karambit, AK-47 Hydroponic, two Glock Fades, and many more besides.</p>



<h3 id="h-3:-flamez-&#8211;-$104,000-inventory" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-3 wp-block-heading">3: FlameZ &#8211; $104,000 inventory</h3>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While you might expect zywOo to have the flashiest inventory on Team Vitality, that crown actually belongs to his teammate flameZ.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Thanks to his Ruby Butterfly Knife, Emerald M9 Bayonet, AK-47 Wild Lotus and M4A4 Howl, flameZ is the first player on the list to crack six figures in his Steam account.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He also has high-tier gloves like Hedge Maze and Amphibious, as well as Desert Eagle Blaze, M4 Hot Rod, and M4 Fade.</p> 



<h3 id="h-2:-donk-&#8211;-$128,000-inventory" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-3 wp-block-heading">2: donk &#8211; $128,000 inventory</h3>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">While many of these skins are almost certainly lent to donk rather than owned by him, his inventory is still a mighty impressive sight.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">One of the coolest skins in his collection is a Factory New Dragon Lore, which he runs alongside a Factory New AK-47 Wild Lotus &#8211; both of which are worth north of $20,000. He also has a very, very low float M4 Knight &#8211; which is used in trade-up contracts for the Dragon Lore &#8211; likely worth five figures too.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Knife-wise, donk has an Emerald Butterfly Knife and M9 Bayonet, plus a Ruby Karambit.&#160;</p>



<h3 id="h-1:-twistzz-&#8211;-$173,000-inventory" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-3 wp-block-heading">1: Twistzz &#8211; $173,000 inventory</h3>



 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Comfortably, the most expensive pro player inventory in CS2 is owned by Team Liquid&#8217;s Twistzz.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Twistzz has held this crown for a long time too, thanks to owning some of the most expensive individual items in all of CS. His most valuable item is a Factory New pair of Crimson Kimono Specialist gloves, which will set you back a cool $30,000. He also has Minimal Wear Pandora&#8217;s Box and Well Worn Hedge Maze gloves.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Easily Twistzz&#8217; most recognizable skin however, is the Factory New AK-47 Wild Lotus, which has a 0.0009 float, and 4x Dignitas Cologne 2014 Holo stickers. This skin is almost certainly lent to Twistzz from a Chinese collector.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">In terms of high-tier knives, Twistzz owns an Emerald Butterfly Knife and a Sapphire M9 Bayonet.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">He also has an M4A4 Howl, AK-47 Gold Arabesque and Fire Serpent, plus Vice Gloves, Glock Fade and a Desert Eagle Blaze.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So those are the top 10 most valuable skin collections owned by professional players. You will no doubt see some of these flashy skins at the upcoming IEM Dallas Major, as pros typically equip their finest items for the biggest event.</p>
