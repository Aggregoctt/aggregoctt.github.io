<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"><a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/schedule-1/">Schedule 1</a> has been pulled from Steam stores, stopping any up-and-coming fan from purchasing the drug-dealing game. Luckily, creator TVGS has promised a fix as quickly as possible.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Despite being released to immense fanfare, Schedule 1 was instantly placed on tricky ground given its subject matter. You play as a drug dealer, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/best-mixing-recipes-in-schedule-1-how-to-mix-3170674/">creating mixes</a> for your <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/best-weed-mixes-in-schedule-1-for-profit-beginners-3173116/">weed</a>, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/best-meth-mixes-in-schedule-1-3173061/">meth</a>, and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/best-cocaine-mixes-in-schedule-1-3173732/">cocaine</a> all while <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/schedule-1-infinite-money-glitch-explained-3171599/">making the most money possible</a>. Despite that, hundreds of thousands of players flooded in to <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/how-to-automate-in-schedule-1-3172852/">automate product</a>, <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/all-cars-in-schedule-1-3172901/">drive around the map</a>, and <a class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/best-barn-layout-for-schedule-1-3174288/">create the best drug base possible</a>.</p> 



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">However, if you&#8217;re looking to become one of its players, then you may be sorely disappointed as Schedule 1 has been pulled from Steam in Australia.</p>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-pulled-from-steam-stores-in-australia-thanks-to-classification" class="text-neutral-grey dark:text-neutral-white font-display font-bold mb-5 external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text text-title-2 wp-block-heading">Schedule 1 pulled from Steam stores in Australia thanks to classification</h2>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Anyone logging into Steam in Australia is currently unable to purchase Schedule 1 due to a classification issue.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Essentially, as highlighted by the game&#8217;s creator in a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary border-b-2 border-vertical-primary dark:hover:text-primary-accent" href="https://x.com/Tyler_TVGS/status/1922046440874115565">post on X</a>, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, the game hasn&#8217;t been banned, but it turns out all games sold in Australia need to receive a classification/age rating. I thought this was only required for console and physical releases.&#8221;</p> 


 


<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">So, given the subject matter, Schedule 1 will need an age rating before it&#8217;s allowed back onto Steam in Australia. Though he continues by explaining, &#8220;I&#8217;m contacting the ratings agency today and getting this resolved ASAP. Apologies for the inconvenience,&#8221; so we can expect it to come back pretty soon.</p>



<p class="w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text">Interestingly, this isn&#8217;t the first game that&#8217;s faced the watch of Australia&#8217;s classification board. The likes of Fallout 3, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and even Saints Row have all been banned on Steam for the same reason. Though, like Schedule 1, the ban is quickly overturned when the game is given the correct classification.</p>
