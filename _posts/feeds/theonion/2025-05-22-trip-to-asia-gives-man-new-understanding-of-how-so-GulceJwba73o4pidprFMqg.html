<p class="theonion-dingbat">BANGKOK&#8212;Taking a moment to reflect on the ways in which his time abroad had expanded his horizons, Cleveland native Dan Steifel told reporters Thursday his trip to Asia had given him an entirely new understanding of how soup could be breakfast. &#8220;Wow, I finally see how ignorant I&#8217;ve been my whole life,&#8221; said Steifel, adding that he had not previously been aware of how his own closed-minded, shamefully pancake-centric ideas had shaped his thinking about breakfast until he tried a traditional Thai morning meal of jok moo sap, a pork, rice, and garlic soup. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I was ever so stupid. I never would&#8217;ve considered that there are people just like me, half a world away, eating soup in the morning instead of cereal or a bagel. I definitely thought soup could be for brunch, or even an early lunch, but breakfast? It just goes to show how we all live in our own little cultural bubbles, especially when it comes to soup. But then again, that&#8217;s why you travel. To learn new things about yourself, about the world, and about what meals soup can be for.&#8221; At press time, Steifel was said to have quietly resolved to eat at his hotel&#8217;s complimentary continental breakfast the next morning.</p>
