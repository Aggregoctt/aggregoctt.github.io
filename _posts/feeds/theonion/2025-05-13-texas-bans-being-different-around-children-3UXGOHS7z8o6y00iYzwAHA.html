<p class="theonion-dingbat">AUSTIN, TX&#8212;In a landmark piece of legislation designed to stifle individuality across the state, the Texas Legislature passed a bill Friday that legally banned being different around children.&#160;&#8220;Starting today, adults are no longer permitted to be unique or to deviate from a narrow set of cultural norms while in the presence of a minor,&#8221; Gov. Greg Abbott said at a press conference, arguing that the possession of any distinctive, unconventional personality traits was a slippery slope on the way to being outright weird. &#8220;No longer will parents have to live in fear of their children one day encountering a quirky, eccentric adult who marches to the beat of their own drum. Anyone who owns a funky wardrobe, exhibits niche interests, or can be considered a free spirit in any sense of the term must stay at least 500 yards away.&#8221;&#160;Abbott added that all adults would now be subject to mandatory &#8220;quirk checks&#8221; to ensure they were boring and uptight enough to be near a minor.</p>
