<p>Wow, what a lovely backyard! It sure was kind of that family to hoist me so high into the air so I could enjoy swaying back and forth in the breeze and taking in this beautiful view. From way up here, I can&#8217;t help but notice all the sparkly streamers and balloons. Say, is it someone&#8217;s birthday today?&#160;</p>



<p>Oh hey! Here comes the birthday boy himself! Hello, little boy! I like your blindfold! And what an adorable little stick you&#8217;re carrying. Did you get that stick for your birthday? My, my, what a wonderful stick! You could use it for twirling or sword-fighting or digging in the dirt&#8212;ow!</p>



<p>Hey, what was that for?&#160;</p>



<p>Listen, little boy, I need you to be gentle with Mr. Pi&#241;ata. Whacking me like that hurts. You wouldn&#8217;t want to hurt me, now, would you? I know I look like a big, tough multicolored donkey, but this papier-m&#226;ch&#233; is actually quite&#8212;ow! Seriously?&#160;</p>



<p>What did I just say?&#160;</p>



<p>Why don&#8217;t we just set down the stick and talk for a minute, okay, buddy? You&#8217;re a nice boy. Strong, but nice. And though I&#8217;m not sure exactly what&#8217;s going on here, it has to be some sort of misunderst&#8212;ow!&#160;</p>



<p>Whoa! What the fuck? You just made a huge dent in my side! This is my body. You can&#8217;t just hit it. I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s your big day. That last smack almost took off my ear. What the hell is wrong with you?</p>



<p>Aghh! Ow! Do you not hear that I&#8217;m in pain? Or do you not even care how much damage you do to me? Please! I&#8217;m begging you! Stop this now, before something terrible happens. Where are your parents? Ow! Oh God, the parents&#8212;they&#8217;re filming me! They&#8217;re filming, and they&#8217;re laughing!</p>



<p>You monsters! Police, police!</p>



<p>Oh, thank God. He&#8217;s stopped. Thank you, little boy. Thank you for coming to your senses. Yes, put down the stick&#8212;wait&#8212;no! No! Don&#8217;t hand it to the bigger child! Why is he being spun around in circles like that? What kind of sick bastard would do something like this at a party?</p>



<p>Shit! Fuck! No! No! My leg! My back right leg&#8212;you just smashed it in! Have mercy! No! Not the belly! Not my beautiful ruffled belly!&#160;</p>



<p>At least&#8212;ow&#8212;take the blindfold off&#8212;ow&#8212;and look me in the eye when you whack me, cowards!&#160;</p>



<p>Enough is enough! Hear me now: When I get down from here, I will hunt you down and ruin your lives in ways you could never anticipate. Do you understand threats, children? When you least expect it, I&#8217;ll show up in your life and I will tear you apart. You and all your goddamn families! Oh God, you aren&#8217;t going to stop, are you?&#160;</p>



<p>Sweet Jesus, my chest is caving in. I&#8217;m losing candy&#8212;I&#8217;m losing candy fast. This wound is too great for any duct tape to patch. Tell my wife I love her. She was the most gorgeous pi&#241;ata in the whole factory, a tasseled neon star. I&#8217;m going to the big Party City in the sky now&#8230;goodbye&#8230;</p>
