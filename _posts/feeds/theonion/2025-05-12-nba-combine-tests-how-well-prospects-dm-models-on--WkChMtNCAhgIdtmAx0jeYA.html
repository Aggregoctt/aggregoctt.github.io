<p class="theonion-dingbat">CHICAGO&#8212;Evaluating whether top college talent like Ace Bailey, Dylan Harper, and Kasparas Jaku&#269;ionis can actually clean up on a professional level, the NBA Draft Combine started this week by testing how well prospects direct-message models on Instagram. &#8220;Sometimes these players&#8217; messages look good on paper, or they&#8217;re showing off on Instagram Reels, but then you see them in person and realize they don&#8217;t have what it takes to DM at an NBA level,&#8221; said Charlotte Hornets scout Cam Twiss, who explained that prospects are assessed on their timing, emoji form, shot selection, and a host of other essential DMing skills. &#8220;Some of them are volume players firing off 30 or 40 DMs a night, while others guys are going to mix it up in the chat and fight for every reply, and the combine gives us a chance to see how they measure up. These aren&#8217;t some local college girls they are dealing with. These are elite women with careers and skills and a professional-level block game. You need a lot more speed and finesse than just texting &#8216;What&#8217;s up?&#8217; with an eggplant. These models are getting hit up by DM legends like LeBron James and Paul George, and we need to predict how these kids will compete with that.&#8221; At press time, top NBA prospect Cooper Flagg was plummeting down draft boards after reportedly getting blocked by three Chicago-area models in a row.</p>
