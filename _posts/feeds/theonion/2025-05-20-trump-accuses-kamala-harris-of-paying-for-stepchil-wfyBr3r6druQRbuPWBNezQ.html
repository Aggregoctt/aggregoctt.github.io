<p class="theonion-dingbat">WASHINGTON&#8212;Calling for a major investigation into her husband&#8217;s son and daughter from a previous marriage, President Donald Trump leveled allegations Tuesday in which he accused Kamala Harris of paying for her stepchildren&#8217;s endorsement in the 2024 presidential election. &#8220;How much money did Kamala give the Emhoff kids to support her during her campaign for president?&#8221; Trump wrote in a Truth Social post, claiming the former vice president had operated under the guise of stepmotherhood to cover up &#8220;illegal&#8221; and &#8220;unpatriotic&#8221; public appearances by Ella and Cole Emhoff. &#8220;There is no reason these stepchildren would have ever come on stage with Kamala if she hadn&#8217;t bribed them. Do you mean to tell me those $250 checks she wrote to each of them last year were just their usual birthday gifts? Not a chance!&#8221; At press time, Trump asserted it was corrupt and unlawful for a person seeking public office to help raise children in exchange for their endorsement.</p>
