<p class="theonion-dingbat">LOS ANGELES&#8212;Appearing nervous as he acknowledged that he had concealed the truth from his fianc&#233;e for far too long, actor Tom Holland confided to reporters Thursday that he was working up the courage to tell Zendaya he was only 17.&#160;&#8220;Oh man, I think I&#8217;m in over my head&#8212;when we go to get our marriage license, they&#8217;re bound to ask for some form of ID with my date of birth on it,&#8221; said Holland, who admitted that while there had been a number of opportunities to come clean over the many years of their relationship, he had always found an excuse to put off telling the award-winning actress that he was legally underage. &#8220;I know it&#8217;s scary, but I&#8217;ve got to do it. If she really loves me, she&#8217;ll accept me for who I am no matter what my age. And maybe she already knows! She has to have some kind of idea considering I haven&#8217;t even gone through my growth spurt yet.&#8221;&#160;Holland later added that he hoped Zendaya would be okay with a long-distance relationship once he started college next fall.&#160;</p>
