<p><strong>The Onion: Why did you create your show Songs For Littles?</strong></p>



<p>Ms. Rachel: I figured if that dipshit Blippi could make it big, anyone could.</p>



<p><strong>The Onion: What song do children love most?</strong></p>



<p>Ms. Rachel: &#8220;Toxicity&#8221; by System of a Down.</p>



<p><strong>The Onion: What inspired you to speak out about Gaza?</strong></p>



<p>Ms. Rachel: While I&#8217;ve enjoyed a great deal of success, my real dream has always been getting called an &#8220;antisemitic cunt&#8221; online.</p>



<p><strong>The Onion: What&#8217;s the biggest advantage of creating content for babies?</strong></p>



<p>Ms. Rachel: They can&#8217;t leave death threats in the comments.&#160;</p>



<p><strong>The Onion: Any fun stories from the set?</strong></p>



<p>Ms. Rachel: One day, no matter how many times I tried, I just couldn&#8217;t count to four correctly. Turns out, I was having a stroke.</p>



<p><strong>The Onion: What do you say to children who recognize you in public?</strong></p>



<p>Ms. Rachel: Don&#8217;t touch the overalls.</p>



<p><strong>The Onion: What do you say to your critics?</strong></p>
