<p class="theonion-dingbat">VAN NUYS, CA&#8212;Using a grand gesture to reveal his feelings to the object of his affection, local teenager Eddy French reportedly stood outside his crush&#8217;s window Friday holding up Peter Gabriel. &#8220;As soon as I pulled back my curtain and saw Eddy in the rain with the original frontman of&#160;Genesis&#160;held high above his head, my heart just swelled,&#8221; said Lola Simmons, 17, telling reporters that despite feeling nervous that her overprotective dad would hear songs from the multiplatinum album So&#160;blaring from the lips of the 75-year-old musician and human rights advocate, she was overtaken by the romantic action. &#8220;No boy has ever done something like this for me before. Once in junior high I had a boyfriend who left me a&#160;Maroon 5&#160;singer in my locker for Valentine&#8217;s Day, but this is a whole other level. The fact that Eddy would go to all this trouble lets me know he really cares about me.&#8221; At press time, French had reportedly tossed Peter Gabriel aside into a nearby bush after Simmons ran up to embrace him passionately.</p>
