<p>Whether you go to a restaurant or host an event in your home, brunch is a great way to celebrate the maternal figures in your life. The Onion shares tips for planning the perfect Mother&#8217;s Day brunch.</p>



<p>Make sure the restaurant serves whatever bullshit your sister&#8217;s eating these days.</p>



<p>Avoid awkward silences by bringing a list of fight starters.</p>



<p>Sit the oldest mother in the room at the head of the table and ask the youngest mother in the room to serve as her chair.</p>



<p>Call ahead to send your mom&#8217;s food back to the kitchen.</p>



<p>Present your mother with a family photo featuring everyone who still talks to her.</p>



<p>Find out what your mom likes eating by allowing her to sniff several varieties of eggs Benedict and seeing which one she licks first.</p>



<p>Get drunk enough to enthusiastically toast your mom, but not so drunk that you mean it.</p>



<p>Everyone loves haggis!</p>



<p>Gift your mother either a beautifully embossed copy of A Room Of One&#8217;s Own with a touching note written inside the cover or a toaster she already owns, depending on your gender.&#160;</p>



<p>Wherever you kids want to go is fine.</p>



<p>Wait until everyone orders before suggesting Dad move back in.</p>



<p class="theonion-dingbat">Just let your mom plan it. She&#8217;s better at that stuff anyway.</p>
