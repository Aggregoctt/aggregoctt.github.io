<p class="theonion-dingbat">LOS ANGELES&#8212;Presenting him with a small-scale gilded anatomical model at a lavish ceremony Monday evening, the American Film Institute honored top leading man Dwayne Johnson for his outstanding accomplishments in the field of neck acting.&#160;&#8220;I am so proud to stand on this stage tonight as we recognize this brilliant performer for his commitment to the art of neck acting,&#8221; said former AFI Golden Trapezius recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger, who led the audience in a thunderous round of applause for the 52-year-old Rampage star and praised him as a &#8220;a master of the Meisner acting technique.&#8221; &#8220;Whether he&#8217;s gulping on cue or simply using his neck to support his head, no one in Hollywood is more committed to their craft. Mr. Johnson, congratulations&#8212;you are a true scapular legend.&#8221;&#160;During an acceptance speech, Johnson&#8217;s neck announced it was launching its own tequila brand.&#160;</p>
