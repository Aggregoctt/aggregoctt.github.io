<p class="theonion-dingbat">ATHENS, OH&#8212;Making a comprehensive determination about her patient almost instantaneously, no-nonsense nurse Mary-Jo McMann was reportedly able to complete a patient&#8217;s entire medical chart Thursday after pinching her arm flab once. &#8220;I had barely gotten into the examination room when she grabs a chunk of my arm between her thumb and forefinger and is immediately able to write down crucial details about my family background and medical history,&#8221; said patient Alison Firestone, telling reporters that the direct and forthright medical caregiver had barely jiggled the fat around her elbow before checking off dozens of boxes on a series of forms. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t so much as ask me to step on a scale or anything, and yet somehow she knew right away my blood pressure was 120 over 80.&#8221; Firestone later confirmed she was billed $3,000 for the arm pinch.</p>
