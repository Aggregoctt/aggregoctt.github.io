<p class="theonion-dingbat">AUSTIN, TX&#8212;Proclaiming that he had &#8220;done enough,&#8221; billionaire Elon Musk confirmed Thursday that he would be taking a step back from fatherhood. &#8220;I&#8217;ve accomplished all I really intended to accomplish as a father&#8212;spreading my seed, preserving my bloodline&#8212;and now I can spend more time focusing on other things,&#8221; said Musk, who told reporters that after pouring millions of dollars and sperm cells into the project, he was ready to scale that number back to zero. &#8220;I need to get my priorities in line. Fatherhood distracted me from what really matters, which is running Tesla. If I see a reason to do it in the future, I&#8217;ll do it, but currently, I don&#8217;t see a reason.&#8221; At press time, sources revealed that Musk&#8217;s decision may have been motivated by falling popularity among his children.</p>
