<p class="theonion-dingbat">SEATTLE&#8212;Deftly jumping into the arena&#8217;s octagon as audience members cheered and laughed, an Ultimate Fighting Championship clown attempted Saturday to lure an irate fighter&#8217;s attention away from his fallen competitor.&#160;The lighthearted performer known as Boxo, who was dressed in brightly colored clothing with his face painted into a frown, reportedly sprang into action and began cartwheeling, hopping from foot to foot, and snapping his big red suspenders after bantamweight headliner Henry Cejudo delivered a knockout punch to contender Song Yadong.&#160;While witnesses confirmed the jaunty entertainer was able to successfully distract Cejudo for several minutes, the fighter eventually clipped him in the torso, sending him several feet into the air as a honking sound reverberated through the stunned arena.&#160;According to reports, the crowd let out a loud cheer when Boxo jumped back up, blew a kiss to the audience, and successfully chased the rowdy UFC fighter back into his holding pen.</p>
