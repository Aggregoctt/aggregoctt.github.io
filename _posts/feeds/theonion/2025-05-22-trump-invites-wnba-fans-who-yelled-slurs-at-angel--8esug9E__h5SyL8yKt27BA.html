<p class="theonion-dingbat">WASHINGTON&#8212;Saying how much he had enjoyed watching their outstanding work on the court, President Donald Trump&#160;invited the&#160;WNBA fans who yelled slurs at Angel Reese to the White House on Thursday. &#8220;Today, we celebrate these hard working Indiana Fever fans who sat within earshot of Angel Reese and yelled racial insults as loudly as they could,&#8221; said Trump, who gleefully shook hands, took photos, and discussed with the fans some of their favorite epithets&#160;and gestures to direct toward the 23-year-old Chicago Sky forward. &#8220;These people are some of the most dedicated, talented racists in America right now, and the way they stepped up, disrupted the game, and spewed hate should make our nation proud. Those were some of the best slurs I&#8217;ve ever heard used to degrade a Black woman. No one represents this country better than they do.&#8221; At press time, the fans were spotted on the White House lawn teaching staffers&#8217; children how to go on a racist tirade.</p>
