<p class="theonion-dingbat">SACRAMENTO, CA&#8212;Promising his podcast listeners an engaging and enlightening conversation, California Gov. Gavin Newsom reportedly sat down Tuesday with a serial killer who targets the homeless population. &#8220;So what do you think Democrats can learn from somebody who, like you, targets the most vulnerable among us?&#8221; said Newsom, who acknowledged that while he and the murderer might not see eye to eye on the best way to eliminate the homeless, he was grateful for the opportunity to exchange ideas and perspectives. &#8220;You hate the homeless, I hate the homeless. People have been very hard on you, but I think at the end of the day, we all really just want the same thing. So, do you wear their skin?&#8221; At press time, podcast listeners were praising the killer for his civility.</p>
