<p class="theonion-dingbat">WASHINGTON&#8212;After a stunning admission that he&#8217;d been diagnosed with a highly aggressive form of the disease, former President Joe Biden reportedly faced mounting pressure on Monday to let a younger Democrat battle cancer. &#8220;Given the current landscape, we think a more youthful, energetic leader would be much better suited to fighting this deadly kind of metastatic prostate cancer,&#8221; said Democratic strategist James Carville, adding that while there likely wasn&#8217;t much time to pivot this late in the disease&#8217;s cycle, there were still several prominent politicians ready to step up and win. &#8220;Right now I think that Gavin Newsom, Josh Shapiro, and Pete Buttigieg are more than ready to take on a cancer with a Gleason&#160;score of 9. There&#8217;s even buzz about Gretchen Whitmer throwing her hat in the ring. Frankly, it&#8217;d send a very powerful message to Republicans if a female governor from a battleground state like Michigan overcame this terrible illness.&#8221; At press time, many Democrats had reportedly placed their support in the tumor, with internal projections showing that it was polling 10 points ahead of a generic Democratic candidate.</p>
