<p class="theonion-dingbat">MEXICO CITY&#8212;In what is being hailed as a groundbreaking linguistic survey of resorts, beaches, and other tourist hotspots, a new report published Wednesday by a consortium of language experts across Mexico found that vacationing sources habla un poquito de espa&#241;ol.&#160;&#8220;According to the data we collected, American-born subjects were eager to tell researchers that they no habla espa&#241;ol bien, pero&#8212;no se la palabra&#8212;they wanted to try,&#8221; read the report, which went on to state that 85% of those surveyed in flip-flops, sunglasses, and festive linen shirts knew phrases like &#8220;hola, me llamo Steve,&#8221; &#8220;d&#243;nde est&#225; el ba&#241;o,&#8221; y &#8220;muchas gracias, se&#241;or&#8221; because they took espa&#241;ol en la escuela. &#8220;Over the course of our research, we discovered that the sample population was eager to approach locals and strike up conversations about la comida, la playa, y las chicas bonitas. Out of 200 tourist participants, over half were also excited to self-report that they parle un peu de fran&#231;ais aussi.&#8221;&#160;In addition, the study found that when addressed in English, 99% of blushing sources shyly admitted that they habla como un gringo y that ay caramba, tu ingl&#233;s es muy bien.</p>
