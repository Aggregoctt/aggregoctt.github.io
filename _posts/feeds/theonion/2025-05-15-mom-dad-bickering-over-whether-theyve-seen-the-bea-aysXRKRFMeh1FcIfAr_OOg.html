<p class="theonion-dingbat">CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA&#8212;With the rest of the family looking on tensely as the conversation grew heated, local parents James and Denise Sweeney were reportedly bickering Tuesday over whether they had seen The Bear.&#160;&#8220;We watched one episode and decided it wasn&#8217;t for us, remember?&#8221; said James Sweeney, who vehemently refuted his wife Denise&#8217;s statement that she &#8220;would like to see&#8221; the FX comedy-drama series, causing his adult children to deeply regret ever mentioning the show. &#8220;I am certain we have seen The Bear. I thought it was okay. You thought it was just all right. No, we definitely tried it. Remember? It&#8217;s the one with all the meat. No, not Beef.&#8221;&#160;At press time, reports confirmed the Sweeneys&#8217; children had succeeded in salvaging the evening by steering the conversation to Yellowstone.</p>
