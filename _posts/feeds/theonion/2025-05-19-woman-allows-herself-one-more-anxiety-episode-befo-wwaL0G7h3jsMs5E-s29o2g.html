<p class="theonion-dingbat">LANSING, MI&#8212;Assuring herself it wasn&#8217;t even that late, local woman Natalie Sissons reportedly allowed herself one more anxiety episode Tuesday before going to bed.&#160;&#8220;Just one more episode of paralyzing apprehension and fear, then I&#8217;ll call it a night,&#8221; said Sissons, admitting that she knew she should try to get some sleep since it was a work night, but that she simply couldn&#8217;t resist another 30 minutes of gripping existential dread. &#8220;It&#8217;s not even 10 p.m. yet. As long as I turn off my feelings of inescapable doom in the next hour or so, I&#8217;ll still get plenty of tense, unfulfilling rest by morning. It&#8217;s so compelling that I doubt I&#8217;ll be able to sleep unless I see this surge of visceral terror through to the end. I&#8217;m just so excited to finally find out what happens to me!&#8221;&#160;Sissons later confirmed she was still awake at 3:30&#160;a.m. after deciding to binge an entire series of panic attacks all at once.&#160;</p>
