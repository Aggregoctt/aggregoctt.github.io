<p class="theonion-dingbat">LIBERTY, MO&#8212;After reading aloud a picture book about a puppy that works in a coal mine, local first grade teacher Brianna Montgomery asked her students Thursday what they want to be once child labor laws are repealed. &#8220;I want everyone to grab some crayons and draw a picture of what you want to be once the governor rolls back all the child labor laws,&#8221; Montgomery said as shouts of &#8220;fish processor!&#8221; and &#8220;farm laborer!&#8221; filled the classroom. &#8220;Joshua, you love video games, so maybe you could work at a plant assembling semiconductor chips. And Michelle, I know you like nature, so I bet you&#8217;d have fun being outside all day picking blueberries. Now, you may think that just because most kids end up working for the local meatpacking plant, you&#8217;ll end up there as well, but it&#8217;s not true. You can go to the big city and work in a poorly ventilated warehouse.&#8221; Later in the school day, students reportedly practiced their math skills by adding up how many hours of subminimum wage work it would take them to earn $100.</p>
