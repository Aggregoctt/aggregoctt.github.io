<p class="theonion-dingbat">WASHINGTON&#8212;With the dispute threatening to derail legislative approval of President Donald Trump&#8217;s &#8220;big, beautiful bill,&#8221; congressional sources confirmed Monday that GOP infighting had erupted over whether the bill was beautiful or handsome. &#8220;Republicans have a lot riding on this legislation, and it&#8217;s a terrible sign that they can&#8217;t even get it out of committee without a screaming match over whether the bill is too rugged to ever be considered &#8216;beautiful,&#8217;&#8221; said conservative political analyst Bryan Stockford, adding that top Democrats had attempted to play these divisions to their advantage by characterizing the bill&#8217;s proposed tax cuts as &#8220;delicate&#8221; and &#8220;voluptuous&#8221; to constituents. &#8220;You also have a few fringe hardliners within the &#8216;beautiful&#8217; camp saying that its provisions for Medicaid work requirements could only ever be described as &#8216;winsome,&#8217; making it hard for Mike Johnson to get the consensus he needs to move it through the House. Unless Republicans can coalesce around the bill being either a dashing, debonair boy bill or a comely, glamorous lady bill, there&#8217;s a real chance this key piece of Trump&#8217;s agenda ends up dying on the floor.&#8221; At press time, House Republicans had reportedly become embroiled in a second argument about whether Trump&#8217;s bill was big or merely curvy.</p>
