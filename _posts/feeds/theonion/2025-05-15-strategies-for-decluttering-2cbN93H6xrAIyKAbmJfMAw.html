<p>Studies have shown that creating a neat and organized living space can reduce stress and improve mental well-being. The Onion provides helpful guidance for decluttering your home.</p>



<p>Lure Marie Kondo into your home using an evenly spaced trail of sensible storage solutions.</p>



<p>Assess if you really need 8,000 terracotta soldiers in your tomb.</p>



<p>Call some friends and family over to shake their heads disapprovingly at what you&#8217;ve become.</p>



<p>Take everything out of the closet or drawer, place it on the ground behind you, and resign yourself to never facing that direction again.</p>



<p>Mass graves are a simple, affordable way to get rid of a corpse problem.</p>



<p>Anything that fits down the toilet goes down the toilet.</p>



<p>Immediately buy a more expensive version of whatever you just threw out.</p>



<p>Let a herd of goats graze inside your home twice weekly.</p>



<p>Running out of room in your junk drawer? It may be time to upgrade to a junk house.</p>



<p>Hang a hornet&#8217;s nest in high-clutter areas of your apartment to discourage yourself from leaving things there.</p>



<p>Die and make your decades&#8217; worth of junk your kid&#8217;s problem.&#160;</p>



<p>Throw out all your bundled issues of Swank except for 1941 to &#8217;45, &#8217;47 to &#8217;49, &#8217;50 to &#8217;53, &#8217;59 to &#8217;67, and &#8217;70 to &#8217;89.</p>



<p class="theonion-dingbat">No! Not my McDonald&#8217;s straw wrapper! I need that!</p>
