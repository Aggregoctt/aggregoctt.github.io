<p class="theonion-dingbat">WASHINGTON&#8212;Condemning what he described as the disturbing and unjust treatment of the group, President Donald Trump granted refugee status this week to former SS guards. &#8220;The discrimination these people are facing is absolutely sick&#8212;they&#8217;re literally hunting them down,&#8221; said Trump, who greeted the small group of centenarians on the tarmac at Dulles International Airport and invited them back to the White House for an official welcome ceremony. &#8220;It&#8217;s targeted violence. The Schutzstaffel have been treated very unfairly for just doing their jobs. Their land was seized and turned into concentration camp museums. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that we get them all into the United States, where they can rest assured they won&#8217;t be discriminated against.&#8221; At press time, Trump was reportedly thanking senior advisor Elon Musk for bringing the plight of the Nazi people to the world&#8217;s attention.</p>
