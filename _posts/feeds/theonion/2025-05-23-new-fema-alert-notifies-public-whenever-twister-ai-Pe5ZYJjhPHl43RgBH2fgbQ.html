<p class="theonion-dingbat">WASHINGTON&#8212;Predicting that the system would save countless Americans from missing an all-time classic, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced the creation of a new alert Friday that would notify the public whenever the 1996 film&#160;Twister&#160;was airing on TNT. &#8220;If&#160;Twister&#160;is playing in your area, you will receive a notification on your phone that reads &#8216;Emergency Warning: Immediately find the nearest TV with basic cable,&#8217;&#8221; said FEMA acting administrator David Richardson, who confirmed the agency had launched the alert system in collaboration with the National Weather Service and the Helen Hunt Fan Club. &#8220;A&#160;Twister&#160;warning means that conditions for the film are just right. For instance, if it&#8217;s 1:30 p.m on a Friday, or if&#160;Angels In The Outfield&#160;was just on. A&#160;Twister&#160;watch means a promo has been spotted, and you should get yourself and your family on the sofa. Now, if you receive a notification saying there&#8217;s a&#160;Twister&#160;warning? Run. That means the F5 scene is already on.&#8221; At press time, sirens across the Great Plains were blaring songs from the film&#8217;s soundtrack, including Stevie Nicks&#8217; &#8220;Twisted&#8221; and Van Halen&#8217;s &#8220;Respect The Wind.&#8221;</p>
