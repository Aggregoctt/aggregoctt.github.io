<p>Starbase, home to SpaceX&#8217;s private launch site, has voted to become an official Texas city. The Onion shares the perfect two-day itinerary for Starbase tourists.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-day-one">Day One</h3>



<p><strong>9:30 a.m.</strong> <strong>Get started at the visitor center</strong></p>



<p>From the airport, head straight to the Starbase Visitor Center, where you can book tours, buy souvenirs, and pick up a handy map showing which facilities your race is allowed to use.</p>



<p><strong>11 a.m. Check out Build-a-Son Workshop at Starbase Mall</strong></p>



<p>Get in touch with your creative side by combining sperm and eggs to make your very own Elon Musk male progeny.</p>



<p><strong>2 p.m. Stroll through the farmers market</strong></p>



<p>Pick up a meal-replacement shake for lunch, or help yourself to one of the many free samples of artisanal monkey jerky.</p>



<p><strong>5:30 p.m. Rocket launch</strong></p>



<p>Watch that big fucker blow up.</p>



<p><strong>8 p.m. Movie night</strong></p>



<p>Head to the drive-in theater to catch the night&#8217;s programming, a video of Elon Musk walking into Twitter HQ carrying a sink, set to a loop for three and a half hours.</p>



<p><strong>1 a.m. The Feeding</strong></p>



<p>The feeding begins.</p>



 



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-day-two">Day Two</h3>



<p><strong>8 a.m. Rise and shine</strong></p>



<p>Start your day as the locals do by heading to the employee cafeteria, grabbing breakfast, and forcing a laugh at whatever Elon Musk does with a banana.</p>



<p><strong>12 p.m. Take an Aryan child sled ride</strong></p>



<p>Enjoy a relaxing ride through town on a sled pulled by six energetic 9-year-olds of pure Caucasian heritage.</p>



<p><strong>3 p.m. Pick up a souvenir </strong></p>



<p>Stop by town hall to purchase a copy of one of the many surveillance photos taken of you and your family during your visit.</p>



<p><strong>7 p.m. Cut loose with Rick And Morty quote karaoke</strong></p>



<p>Head to the local bar and participate in the time-honored tradition of shouting quotes from the animated series at the top of your lungs. </p>



<p><strong>2:30 a.m. Awaken to screaming. Across the way, a waifish woman holding a baby hangs out a window yelling for help. Is that&#8230;Grimes?</strong></p>



<p>Yes! Good spot.</p>



<p><strong> 4 a.m. Come to bound and gagged inside a SpaceX test rocket </strong></p>



<p class="theonion-dingbat">The last thing you may remember is something hard hitting the back of your head. It&#8217;s Starbase fun for the whole family. </p>
