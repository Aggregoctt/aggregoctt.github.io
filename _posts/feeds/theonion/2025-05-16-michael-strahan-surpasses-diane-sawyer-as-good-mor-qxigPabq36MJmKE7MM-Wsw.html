<p class="theonion-dingbat">NEW YORK&#8212;After months of closing in on the former news anchor&#8217;s legendary record, Michael Strahan surpassed&#160;Diane Sawyer on Friday as&#160;Good Morning America&#8216;s all-time sack leader. &#8220;Throughout his career on GMA, Strahan has led the show in tackles, forced fumbles, interceptions, and, most importantly, sacks,&#8221; said&#160;producer Greg Emerson, adding that Strahan&#8217;s speed, strength, and ability to penetrate the offensive line and rush the passer had also earned him the title of ABC&#8217;s Defensive Anchor of the Year. &#8220;Many people said Diane Sawyer was, and always would be, the undisputed queen of the blitz. But despite suffering a pectoral injury and being put on the IR broadcasting list, Michael Strahan was able to recover, tackle George Stephanopoulos during an in-studio cooking segment, and beat Sawyer&#8217;s long-standing record of 140 career sacks.&#8221; At press time, Strahan had reportedly been traded to CBS Mornings in exchange for CBS all-time pass rusher Gayle King and CBS return specialist/backup wide receiver Nate Burleson.</p>
