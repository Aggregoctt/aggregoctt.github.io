<p class="theonion-dingbat">MIAMI&#8212;Groaning as he scrolled through the terms and conditions and agreed to hold the platform harmless in the event of a financial loss, local man Ben Tormos told reporters Monday that he couldn&#8217;t believe he had to download a stupid app just to bribe the president. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t bribing the president be as straightforward as doing a dead drop of a briefcase in a parking garage like it used to be?&#8221; said Tormos, complaining that he had to link his bank account to a cryptocurrency exchange and make space on his phone by deleting some of the apps he used to bribe other world leaders and public officials. &#8220;What do you mean I have to &#8216;create a wallet&#8217; and convert all my funds into special tokens? This was supposed to make kickbacks simple and streamlined, but it&#8217;s just a headache. Christ, I don&#8217;t want push notifications informing me about new opportunities to funnel money to the president and his family.&#8221; At press time, Tormos&#8217; phone was reportedly glitching as a result of the Chinese spyware that came with the app.</p>
