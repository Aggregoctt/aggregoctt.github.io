<p class="theonion-dingbat">MINNEAPOLIS&#8212;Moved by the animal&#8217;s unwavering devotion, sources confirmed Wednesday that local 4-year-old cocker spaniel Biscuit refused to move from the spot where he had killed his beloved owner. &#8220;What a unique bond they must have had,&#8221; said Janice Meyer, a neighbor of the deceased, explaining how the faithful dog had sat attentively on the blood-splattered carpeting ever since ripping out the throat of 32-year-old Edward Shauger. &#8220;Day or night, rain or shine, he&#8217;s there, gnawing on a piece of his owner&#8217;s face. Dogs really are special. It almost makes you want to cry.&#8221; Reached for comment, officials from the local coroner&#8217;s office confirmed they had given up on recovering the owner&#8217;s body.</p>
