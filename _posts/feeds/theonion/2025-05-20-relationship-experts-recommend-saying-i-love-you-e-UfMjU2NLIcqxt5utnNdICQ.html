<p class="theonion-dingbat">ORLANDO, FL&#8212;Emphasizing that it&#8217;s just words, after all, a team of relationship experts issued a recommendation Thursday that stressed the importance of saying &#8220;I love you&#8221; even if you don&#8217;t mean it.&#160;&#8220;It can be stressful when a significant other prompts you to verbalize your affection, but if you immediately say &#8216;I love you,&#8217; you can avoid making things even more stressful,&#8221; couples therapist Randall Woodard told reporters, explaining that sometimes you just have to &#8220;fake it until you make it,&#8221; and that&#8217;s even more true when it comes to expressing love for your partner. &#8220;We actually recommend saying &#8216;I love you&#8217; as soon as possible after meeting someone, regardless of your true feelings. Ultimately, adult relationships are something you have to deal with even if, deep inside, you&#8217;re filled with nothing more than a general numbness and you aren&#8217;t sure you&#8217;re capable of achieving a genuine emotional attachment to another person. The reality is that partners enjoy hearing &#8216;I love you&#8217; and never know whether you&#8217;re saying it sincerely or not.&#8221;&#160;Woodard went on to offer a reminder that &#8220;I love you&#8221; is most effective when spoken during a fight, as it essentially functions as a get-out-of-jail-free card.</p>
