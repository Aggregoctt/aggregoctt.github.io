				Hello Kitty worked with the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/">United Nations</a> and Verified to launch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeJOFFkkakU&amp;feature=youtu.be">a new YouTube video</a> aimed at helping young people understand the consequences of sharing harmful information online and giving them tips to share content safely
 
Let&#8217;s all think twice before sharing misleading or harmful content online.&#160;Take care, before you share!
<p>Minami Maeda, Brand Manager for Hello Kitty at Sanrio Co Ltd, says:</p>
<p>&#8216;With so much going on in the world, each of us must remember to be compassionate. We are releasing this video, specifically, because we can&#8217;t physically get together, and we would like the world to be a wonderful place where we can connect on social media safely. Hello Kitty thinks that, &#8220;<strong>Words should be used to talk about dreams with someone, or to express kindness to each other</strong>.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
