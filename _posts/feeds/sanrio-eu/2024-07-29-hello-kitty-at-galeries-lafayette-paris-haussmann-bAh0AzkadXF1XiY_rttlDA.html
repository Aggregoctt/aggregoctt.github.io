				<p>To celebrate her 50th anniversary, Hello Kitty joins the Galeries Lafayette Paris Haussmann from 18 July to 26 August and invites all her visitors to its pop-up store in Paris. The kawaii corner on the 3rd floor, created for the occasion, is inspired by Paris: metro station, Moris columns, and daily kiosks!<br>
Let&#8217;s meet at the immersive Hello Kitty pop-up at the Galeries Lafayette Paris Haussmann to discover the selection of products developed exclusively for the occasion titled &#171;Hello Kitty x Galeries Lafayette&#8221;.<br>
Also profit from the photocalls present on the pop-up to make beautiful selfies with Hello Kitty in front of the Eiffel Tower, or with a plush column! The Japanese mascot will be present on August 6th to delight her visitors.<br>
Even if the strong French Touch brings majesty to the French creation of today, Hello Kity also pays homage to the Cuty of Lights with the exclusive collection &#8220;Hello Paris&#8221;, with products in partnership with French brands such as Flotte, Le Bijou Parisien, Marie Martens or even Balzac Paris.</p>
