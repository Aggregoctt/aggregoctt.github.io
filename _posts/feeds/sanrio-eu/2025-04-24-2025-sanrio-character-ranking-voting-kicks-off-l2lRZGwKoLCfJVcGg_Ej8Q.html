				<p>Sanrio is thrilled to announce that the 2025 Sanrio character ranking, a character popularity voting event celebrating its 40th anniversary, is <strong>now open!</strong></p>
<p>The Sanrio character ranking is a popular annual event in which characters selected from over 450 Sanrio characters are nominated, and their rankings are determined by fan voting. First launched in 1986 in Sanrio&#8217;s official publication The Strawberry News, the event has continued to grow with the support of countless fans.</p>
<p>This year marks the milestone 40th anniversary of the event.<br>
In 2025, a total of 90 characters will be entering the competition. The final results will be announced on Sunday, June 29, during Day 2 of SANRIO FES 2025, to be held at Pacifico Yokohama.<br>
We invite you to celebrate this special anniversary year together with the characters, as they aim for an even bigger &#8220;Juuump!&#8221; into the future.</p>
<p>Can Cinnamoroll secure his first-ever 6th consecutive win, or will there be a surprise victory? Who will rise to the top in the 40th anniversary year? Be sure to check out the rankings of the characters also celebrating anniversaries this year!</p>
<p>Last year, Cinnamoroll, Pochacco, and Kuromi claimed the top three spots. Will Cinnamoroll make history by achieving his first-ever six-year winning streak? Can Pochacco, who made headlines by soaring to first place in the initial results last year, or the ever-rising Kuromi pull off a dramatic victory? The competition is heating up! Also, don&#8217;t miss how My Melody and Little Twin Stars&#8212;both celebrating their 50th anniversaries this year&#8212;will rank in this milestone edition.</p>
