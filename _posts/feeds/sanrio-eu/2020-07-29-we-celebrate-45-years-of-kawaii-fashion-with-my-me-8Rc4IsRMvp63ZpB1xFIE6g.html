She is an honest and good-natured girl, always recognised by the treasured hood her Grandma made her. Much like Hello Kitty, My Melody is an icon of <strong>friendship and kawaii style</strong>. In fact, My Melody&#8217;s long ears are said to be antennas of friendship that can tell straight away if someone is happy or sad!</p>
