				<p>This month, the world is getting a little cuter and kinder with the arrival of <strong>Hello Kitty: Super Style!</strong>, coming exclusively to <strong>Amazon Kids+</strong> on <strong>December 7</strong>. Along with a cast of beloved Sanrio characters and a few new friends, global pop-culture icon Hello Kitty makes her 3D debut in this new, <strong>Amazon Kids+ Original animated series</strong>, created for viewers ages 5-8. The series is a continuation of Sanrio&#8217;s commitment to build emotional connections with existing and new generations of fans through digital content that encourages a community of kindness and inclusivity.</p>
<p>The catchy, playful series theme song is performed by GRAMMY&#174;-nominated singer/songwriter and Hello Kitty superfan <strong>Carly Rae Jepsen</strong>. The song and lyrics were written by Jared Faber, who created music for <i>Captain Underpants and Teen Titans Go!</i>. The series begins with six new episodes, with the remainder of <strong>the 52-episode series arriving throughout 2023</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Hello Kitty: Super Style!</strong> is a show about how anyone can be a great friend by being courageously kind. With the power of her magical bow, Hello Kitty activates an amazing transformation to become a brave explorer, high jumping athlete, sensational pop star and more to help her friends and save the day. When Hello Kitty&#8217;s friend, Zonty, is afraid to roller skate, she transforms into Athlete Kitty to help him find the confidence he needs to take a spin on his own! And, when Frido forgets a gift for her buddy on Friendship Day, Artist Kitty is ready to help her express herself to show she cares. Hello Kitty Super Style! is an action-packed series full of heart and humor, with new original music and adorable and diverse characters, who help deliver social-emotional life lessons about confidence and compassion in every episode.</p>
<p>&#8220;This series has lots of fun playing up Hello Kitty&#8217;s super style, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s really about her being a super friend. The world needs more kindness right now, and Hello Kitty is a compassionate hero who doesn&#8217;t judge others. She makes a point of embracing everyone&#8217;s point of view,&#8221; said Amazon Kids+ original series head <strong>Veronica Pickett</strong>.</p>
<p>For over 60+ years, <strong>Sanrio</strong> has engaged consumers through a wide variety of offerings that foster emotional bonds. From sweet treats to apparel and home goods, the brand has cemented its core values, which foster expressing heartfelt feelings for others, making any moment with Hello Kitty and friends a memorable one.

<p>&#8220;Hello Kitty: Super Style! is a great example of how Sanrio&#8217;s longstanding commitment to friendship and kindness remains eternally relevant for so many audiences,&#8221; says <strong>Craig Takiguchi</strong>, Chief Operating Officer and Head of Business Development at Sanrio, Inc. &#8220;Thanks to this collaboration with Amazon Kids+, we&#8217;re excited to see these values reflected online and IRL, and look forward to continuing our evolution in the digital space to engage with fans of all ages in meaningful ways&#8221;.</p>
<p>In this fun and action-packed series, Hello Kitty stars as the friendliest face in Cherry Town &#8211; a small-town hero who will stop at nothing to help a friend in need and get them smiling. Whether she&#8217;s helping someone overcome a fear, share with a friend, or find the confidence to try something new, Kitty uses sprinkles of kindness, oodles of heart and a dose of bow power! Her bow wiggles, glitters and glows when a friend is in need, activating an amazing transformation that changes her costume to be a brave explorer, a cunning detective, a top-notch chef, high jumping athlete, sensational pop star, or any of a number of personas, to help her tackle the challenge ahead. She&#8217;s a super friend with super style that accentuates her confidence and determination to help her friends overcome obstacles and bring the tight-knit community of Cherry Town even closer together.</p>
