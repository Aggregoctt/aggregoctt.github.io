				<p><strong>The mobile game <a href="https://www.hellokittykawaiiworld.com">Hello Kitty AR: Kawaii World</a> is&#160;launching globally in 2021.</strong></p>
<p>Due to the uncertainties arising from the Covid-19 emergency, Sanrio has, together with Bublar Group, decided to move the global launch of Hello Kitty AR: Kawaii World to 2021.</p>
<p>Hello Kitty AR: Kawaii World is a location-based mobile game where players have the possibility to play together outdoors. The benefit of the game, apart from the game play itself, is that it encourages collaboration, reaching for trophies outdoors and exercise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Considering the current situation with Covid-19 we feel that we have a big responsibility as companies towards our future gamers to not increase the spread of the virus while promoting a mobile location-based game with those features. We would like the fans and future players of Hello Kitty to feel safe and be safe,&#8221; says Magnus Granqvist, Managing Director at Bublar Group&#8217;s Game Studio Virtual Brains.</p>
