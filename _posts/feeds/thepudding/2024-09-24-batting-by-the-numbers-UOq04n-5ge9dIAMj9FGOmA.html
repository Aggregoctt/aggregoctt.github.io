title: Batting by the Numbers

<div><p> The classic No. 2 hitter is all about &#8220;bat control.&#8221; That might mean hitting for a solid average, as Ozzie Smith, &#8220;The Wizard of Oz,&#8221; often did in his career. But it might also mean deliberately hitting the ball &#8220;behind the runner&#8221; to reduce the risk of a double play &#8212; or even to lay down a perfect sacrifice bunt. The important thing was to make sure the leadoff hitter got into scoring position for the big bats to drive in later. And a little speed from this spot never hurts, especially since it helps those ground balls turn into infield hits.</p><p> No place in the lineup showcases how the game has changed more than the No. 2 slot. Remember how the second spot in the order used to be all about making contact and moving runners over? Now, the <a href="https://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2009/3/17/795946/optimizing-your-lineup-by" target="_blank">data say</a> that your best overall hitter should hit second rather than third, as originally believed. At the No. 2 spot, they will come to the plate more often, and less frequently with two outs. This is why better overall hitters &#8212; and especially better power hitters, like Trout, Seager, and Ohtani, hit in the 2-hole more than they ever did in the past.</p></div>
