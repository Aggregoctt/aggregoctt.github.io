title: The Greatest Game You’ve Never Heard of

<div> <p class="svelte-1t4ndo9 visible"> The main objective is to flick your discs into higher-scoring regions. <strong>The center hole is worth 20 points.</strong> Be careful, though&#8212;eight pegs surround the fifteen-point region.</p> <p class="svelte-1t4ndo9"> Here, your opponent shoots on an empty board. To be a valid shot (and stay on the board) the disc must land within the 15-point region.</p> <p class="svelte-1t4ndo9"> If any opponent discs are on the board, your disc must hit one to be valid and stay on the board.</p> <p class="svelte-1t4ndo9"><strong>Give it a try:</strong> Hit your opponent&#8217;s disc. Use the <strong>slider and button</strong> below the board to position your disc. Then aim, hold the shoot button to find the perfect power, and release.</p> <p class="svelte-1t4ndo9"> If you shoot and it is an invalid shot, your disc is removed from the board and is not scored.</p> <p class="svelte-1t4ndo9"> It&#8217;s your turn, and there are no opponent discs. You just need to land in the fifteen-point region, <strong>but scoring a 20 is ideal.</strong> A made 20 is set aside and counted.</p> <p class="svelte-1t4ndo9"><strong>Give it a try:</strong> Shoot your disc into the center hole to secure the 20 points.</p> <p class="svelte-1t4ndo9"> After all sixteen discs are played, points are tallied based on the regions and any 20s. The round winner is the player with the most points, and a game consists of multiple rounds.</p> </div>
