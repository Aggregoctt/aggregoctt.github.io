Tap the left side to go back, right to go forward <br> <span class="use-keyboard svelte-srrfmv">(or use the keyboard <span class="key svelte-srrfmv">&lt;</span> <span class="key svelte-srrfmv">&gt;</span> )</span>   It all started when Mary said that Jen &#8220;smelled like hospital.&#8221; <h2 class="svelte-1bclicl"> Let&#8217;s rewind.</h2><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> Mary Cosby and Jen Shah are cast members on <i>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City</i>.</p><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> If this show isn&#8217;t on your radar, it&#8217;s time to fix that. As one of the newest installments of the <i>Real Housewives</i> franchise, it follows the lives of wealthy women living in or near Salt Lake City, Utah, and delivers top-tier drama.</p>  From the first episode, it&#8217;s clear Jen and Mary don&#8217;t see eye to eye. Why? One unforgettable comment: Mary said that Jen &#8220;smelled like hospital.&#8221;  Fast forward a bit, and the two are at a party together. Jen is still holding onto the comment and wants an apology from Mary. <h2 class="svelte-1bclicl"> What makes for a good apology?</h2><p class="svelte-1bclicl"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-ApAdEOm5s&amp;ab_channel=TED-Ed" target="_blank">Research</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1150972343/how-to-say-sorry-give-good-apology" target="_blank">on</a> <a href="https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/relationships-love/a42408012/steps-to-apologize/" target="_blank">the</a> subject highlights some recurring themes.</p><ul class="svelte-7fhy53"><li class="svelte-7fhy53">&#9745;&#65039; say you&#8217;re sorry</li><li class="svelte-7fhy53">&#9745;&#65039; own it</li><li class="svelte-7fhy53">&#9745;&#65039; show remorse</li><li class="svelte-7fhy53">&#9745;&#65039; commit to do better in the future</li></ul> <h2 class="svelte-1bclicl"> Let&#8217;s see how Mary handles it.</h2>    It doesn&#8217;t end well.<br>(It rarely does.)   <h2 class="svelte-1bclicl"> In the world of reality television, apologies are a central theme.</h2><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> People are constantly wronging each other, confronting each other, demanding apologies, and&#8212;more often than not&#8212;sidestepping them. We can tell the apologies don&#8217;t work because the same issues resurface in the next episode, again and again.</p>   <p class="svelte-1bclicl"> To understand just how bad these apologies are, I went through every episode of <i>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City</i> and documented the apology moments.</p> <p class="svelte-1bclicl"> These are 187 moments when an apology was being attempted or demanded. Almost every episode has at least one, including the moment we just saw of Jen storming out in Season 1, Episode 1.</p> <p class="svelte-1bclicl"> And while some cast members do a better job than others, it&#8217;s clear that bad apologies are as central to the show (if not more) than good ones.</p><h3 class="svelte-r0qruf"><span class="good">Good</span> vs. <span class="bad">bad</span> apologies by cast member</h3>  Lisa Barlow 5 seasons 19%81%Jen Shah 3 seasons 50%50%Heather Gay 5 seasons 65%35%Whitney Rose 5 seasons 46%54%Meredith Marks 5 seasons 56%44%Angie Katsanevas 2 seasons 50%50%Mary Cosby 3 seasons 20%80%Monica Garcia 1 season 67%33%Bronwyn Newport 1 season 33%67%Jennie Nguyen 1 season 33%67%   <h2 class="svelte-1bclicl"> Why are the women of RHOSLC so bad at apologizing?</h2><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> To find out, I watched all 94 episodes and dissected some of the messiest moments with a therapist.</p><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> This show is unwittingly a masterclass in <strong><span class="dark-purple">how <i>not</i> to apologize</span></strong>, which turns out to hold valuable lessons for all of us on how to get it right.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1bclicl"> This is how many times each cast member has said the word <span class="blue">&#8220;sorry&#8221;</span>.</h2><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> This is excluding times where the word was used outside of the context of an apology. Some people say it freely, others not so much.</p><h3 class="svelte-r0qruf"> Total "sorry"s by cast member</h3>  Lisa Barlow 5 seasons 65Jen Shah 3 seasons 49Heather Gay 5 seasons 40Whitney Rose 5 seasons 38Meredith Marks 5 seasons 21Angie Katsanevas 2 seasons 16Mary Cosby 3 seasons 14Monica Garcia 1 season 10Bronwyn Newport 1 season 5Jennie Nguyen 1 season 3   <h2 class="svelte-1bclicl"> Is saying &#8220;sorry&#8221; what makes an apology?</h2><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> The presence of the word is a decent proxy for a good apology. If someone doesn&#8217;t want to say &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; it feels like they&#8217;re sidestepping a true apology. There&#8217;s a lot present in the two words&#8212;taking ownership, showing remorse. It&#8217;s simple, but powerful.</p> 
  Take a look at this moment&#8211;Jen is attempting to apologize, but just can&#8217;t help adding some more after the &#8220;sorry.&#8221;  That&#8217;s psychotherapist <a href="https://www.lazaruslynch.com/" target="_blank">Lazarus Lynch</a>. I showed him some scenes from the show to get his take. <p class="svelte-1bclicl"> But at the same time, we don&#8217;t want to give &#8220;sorry&#8221; too much weight. Sometimes the word becomes a magic wand, a shortcut to accomplishing everything an apology needs without trying.</p>  Like here, where Britani decides she wants to &#8220;officially&#8221; apologize for saying rude things about Bronwyn&#8217;s husband. She goes through the motions, but it doesn&#8217;t land.  Or here, where Lisa repeatedly shouts &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for your loss!&#8221; at Whitney, which also doesn&#8217;t land. <h2 class="svelte-1bclicl"> So while a simple <span class="dark-purple">&#8220;sorry&#8221;</span> can accomplish a lot, it doesn&#8217;t always equate to a good apology.</h2> <p class="svelte-1bclicl"> When I first started going through these apology moments, I figured a key piece of what would make for a good apology was that it seemed genuine.</p><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> But Lazarus said he actually doesn&#8217;t consider genuineness to be the most important part of a good apology&#8212;just because someone seems sorry doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean they really are or that real healing will happen.</p> <p class="svelte-1bclicl"> That might help explain this: here are Jen Shah&#8217;s apologies. Fans of the show might be surprised that she has the second most total apologies (despite only 3 seasons as a main cast member) and many of them are classified as &#8220;good.&#8221;</p><h3 class="svelte-r0qruf"><span class="good">Good</span> vs. <span class="bad">bad</span> apologies by cast member</h3>  Lisa Barlow 5 seasons 19%81%Jen Shah 3 seasons 50%50%Heather Gay 5 seasons 65%35%Whitney Rose 5 seasons 46%54%Meredith Marks 5 seasons 56%44%Angie Katsanevas 2 seasons 50%50%Mary Cosby 3 seasons 20%80%Monica Garcia 1 season 67%33%Bronwyn Newport 1 season 33%67%Jennie Nguyen 1 season 33%67%    Jen actually does apologize a lot. And she does a good job. She owns it, she shows remorse, vows to do better. Like here, where she apologizes to Meredith and Seth for gossipping about their marriage.  Or here, where she apologizes for her behavior while also sharing context on her childhood that helps explain (but not excuse) her actions. <p class="svelte-1bclicl"> So, is Jen the queen of apologies and healthy, harmonious relationships?</p> <p class="svelte-1bclicl"> Not so much. The problem with many of Jen&#8217;s apologies is that after these moments, she turns around and finds herself in the same situations again. There are clearly no lasting changes to her behavior.</p><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> Perhaps these believable yet flimsy apologies shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise from someone who is currently <a href="https://www.realitytea.com/2024/10/17/jen-shah-prison-sentence-reduced-details/" target="_blank">in prison for a career of fraud</a>.</p>    There&#8217;s more to an apology than what is said in the moment. There&#8217;s also what happens after the apology. <h2 class="svelte-1bclicl"> If the goal of an apology is to create healing, change on the other side needs to be demonstrated for it to hold up.</h2><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> This also explains why so many issues on the show recur again and again, ready to be brought up at any minute. The final step of actually facing the thing you apologized for, bettering yourself, and being different rarely occurs.</p>   <h2 class="svelte-1bclicl"> Whew.</h2><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> It can be infuriating to watch these ineffective apologies and constant conflict.</p><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> As audience members, we feel like we can see where they went wrong, why the apologies aren&#8217;t working, thinking we would do better if we were in their shoes.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1bclicl"> But would we?</h2><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> Let&#8217;s consider their situation: On this show, women who barely get along are forced to spend a lot of time together. They are encouraged by producers to share their feelings, air their grievances, and confront each other, which all make for great TV. And frequent, if messy, apology attempts.</p><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> Would we really do much better if we were forced to manage conflict this much?</p> <h2 class="svelte-1bclicl"> Apologies are just really hard.</h2><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> And there&#8217;s a deeper reason for that. Let&#8217;s look at a moment from Lisa Barlow, who has the most opportunities to apologize, but seems to be the worst at it.</p><h3 class="svelte-r0qruf"><span class="good">Good</span> vs. <span class="bad">bad</span> apologies by cast member</h3>  Lisa Barlow 5 seasons 19%81%Jen Shah 3 seasons 50%50%Heather Gay 5 seasons 65%35%Whitney Rose 5 seasons 46%54%Meredith Marks 5 seasons 56%44%Angie Katsanevas 2 seasons 50%50%Mary Cosby 3 seasons 20%80%Monica Garcia 1 season 67%33%Bronwyn Newport 1 season 33%67%Jennie Nguyen 1 season 33%67%    Here, Meredith shares that she didn&#8217;t feel like Lisa was there for her when her father died.   <h2 class="svelte-1bclicl"> This gets to the heart of what makes apologies hard.</h2><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> I actually relate to Lisa a bit here. No one wants to be seen as bad.</p><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> It&#8217;s easy to fall into this trap when asked to apologize: mistaking it for an attack on one&#8217;s character, and getting defensive.</p><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> It&#8217;s as if, suddenly, the conversation is not simply about the fact that I picked up the wrong salad greens from the store. It&#8217;s about something much bigger and more threatening: whether you see me as a good person, and more importantly, whether deep down I do.</p>  This moment from psychologist and author on apologies Harriet Lerner&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r6Y9uhmL6Y&amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks" target="_blank">Ted Talk</a> encapsulates it well.   <h2 class="svelte-1bclicl"> From Lisa Barlow to the everyday people-pleaser, apologies can tear at our innermost ego.</h2><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> They ask us to take a raw, honest, and sometimes painful look at ourselves.</p><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> So instead, we ghost. We withhold. We nurture resentment.</p><p class="svelte-1bclicl"><i>The Real Housewives</i> is actually a fascinating case study of people reckoning with this deeply human challenge (for our amusement).</p> <p class="svelte-1bclicl"> We started out with a notion of good and bad apologies, but apologizing well is not only deeply hard, but deeply subjective. Healing is complicated, and requires more than completing a checklist.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1bclicl"> Healthy relationships will require us to both give and seek apologies.</h2><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> They will require us to face the fact that we have caused pain, and to not turn away from it. They will require us to be honest about what hurts us.</p><p class="svelte-1bclicl"> If the women of RHOSLC are getting so much practice, why can&#8217;t we?</p>     <p class="svelte-q9id46"><a href="https://patreon.com/thepudding" class="svelte-q9id46">Support us on Patreon</a> </p> <p class="svelte-q9id46">We pour our heart into these stories, but they take time and
