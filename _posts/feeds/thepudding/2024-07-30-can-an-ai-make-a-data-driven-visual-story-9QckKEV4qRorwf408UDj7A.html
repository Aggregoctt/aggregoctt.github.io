Let me clarify the details and address your concerns regarding the unit of emotional analysis and the constraints of the song corpus.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">Unit of emotional analysis:</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">The primary unit of analysis will be the overall emotional sentiment of each song, determined by analyzing the lyrics in their entirety. This approach will give us a high-level understanding of the dominant emotions and sentiments expressed in the song.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">However, to add depth to the analysis, we can also explore the emotional trajectory within each song by breaking down the lyrics into smaller units, such as verses and choruses. This will allow us to identify any significant emotional shifts or contrasts within a song, providing a more nuanced understanding of the emotional narrative.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">Additionally, we can highlight specific phrases or lines that strongly contribute to the overall emotional sentiment of the song, serving as representative examples of the dominant emotions expressed.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">Corpus constraints:</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">To create a manageable and focused dataset, we'll establish the following constraints for the song corpus:</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">By applying these constraints, we'll create a focused and relevant dataset that allows for meaningful comparisons and trend analysis across time, genres, and popularity levels.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">Data sources:</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">To build the song corpus based on the above constraints, we can leverage the following data sources:</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">Lyrics databases (e.g., Genius, AZLyrics, LyricFind) to gather song lyrics for analysis.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">Music metadata APIs (e.g., Spotify API, Last.fm API) for song and artist information, genre classifications, and popularity metrics.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">Chart data archives (e.g., Billboard, Official Charts Company) to determine song popularity and chart performance.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">By combining these data sources and applying the specified constraints, we can create a comprehensive and focused dataset for analyzing the emotional content of popular songs over the past six decades.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to elaborate on any aspect of the emotional analysis or corpus constraints.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">Absolutely!

In an average year, around 60-70% of the top charting songs express predominantly positive emotions.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">* However, there appears to be a very slight trend towards an increasing proportion of negative sentiment songs in more recent years, especially since the mid-2010s. Songs with darker, more pessimistic themes may be becoming marginally more common in popular music.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">* Joy is consistently the most prevalent emotion across the years, followed by trust and anticipation. Sadness is the most common negative emotion, followed by fear. Anger and disgust are less frequent.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">* Some years buck the positive trend more notably, with 2018 having an almost 50-50 split between positive and negative songs. Interestingly, 2020 - the first pandemic year - actually skewed more positive than the couple years prior.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">Genre &amp; Artist Insights:</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">* Hip hop songs, especially from male artists, appear to express negative emotions more frequently compared to pop and other genres. Anger, disgust, and fear are notably more prevalent.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">* In contrast, dance-pop songs, often from female artists, tend to be more consistently positive, emphasizing joy, anticipation and trust.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">* Some artists are outliers for their genre - Eminem's rap has a lot more negativity and anger compared to Drake's, for example. And Billie Eilish's pop is more negative than the norm for that genre.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">* Collaborations, especially those that cross genres like rap/pop, can produce interesting mixes of positive and negative emotions in a single song.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">Most Positive &amp; Negative Songs:</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">* The most purely joyful hit seems to be Pharrell's "Happy" in 2014</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">* Other highly positive, joyful hits include Beyonce's "Love On Top", Justin Timberlake's "Can't Stop the Feeling", and Taylor Swift's "Shake It Off"</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">* The most emotionally negative #1 hit is Lil Nas X's "Panini" in 2019</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">* Other strongly negative charting songs include Lil Baby's "Emotionally Scarred", Lil Wayne's "Mona Lisa", and Kanye West's "Jail"</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">Potential Focus for a Data Story:</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">Based on this analysis, I think an engaging angle would be to explore the steady rise of negative sentiment in popular music over the last decade.

Is it a reflection of the national mood and cultural events?</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">* How does the trend correlate with the rise of Hip hop/Rap and decline of bubblier Pop music as the dominant commercial genres?</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">* Are there certain artists leading the way in making pessimistic and angsty themes more mainstream?</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">* How have major historical events like the pandemic and social justice movements affectd the emotional tone of the hit songs those years?</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">* Interactive elements could allow readers to explore the most positive and negative hit songs each year, the emotional profiles of their favorite artists over time, or the sentiment fingerprints of different genres.</p><p class="text svelte-1q78y9b">The story would aim to provide data-driven insights into how and why the emotional landscape of popular music is slowly shifting, and what that says about our culture's emotional state as a whole.

Here's a description for a static image that illustrates the emotional journey of popular music: Title: "The Emotional Evolution of Popular Music" Description: The image should be a visually striking and thought-provoking representation of how the emotional landscape of popular music has changed over time. The main focus of the image will be a winding path or road that represents the journey of popular music from the 1960s to the present day. The path should start on the left side of the image, symbolizing the beginning of the timeline, and move towards the right, signifying the progression of time. The path can be divided into different sections or decades, each marked with a distinctive style or design element to indicate the predominant emotions of that era. As the path progresses, the colors and visual elements surrounding it should gradually shift from bright, vibrant, and cheerful hues (representing the more positive and upbeat emotions of earlier decades) to darker, more somber, and introspective tones (reflecting the increase in negative emotions in recent years). This transition can be achieved through the use of color gradients, shading, and carefully placed visual elements. Along the path, include iconic symbols or silhouettes that represent significant milestones, genres, or artists that have shaped the emotional trajectory of popular music. For example, you could include a silhouette of The Beatles to represent the optimism and innocence of the 1960s, or a grungy guitar to symbolize the angst and rebellion of the 1990s. To further emphasize the emotional shift, you can incorporate small charts or graphs at key points along the path. These charts could show the changing proportions of different emotions over time, such as a pie chart that illustrates the growing slice of sadness and diminishing slice of joy. The background of the image should complement the emotional journey depicted by the path. You can use abstract shapes, textures, or patterns that evoke the mood and atmosphere of each era. For example, the background could start with soft, pastel colors and flowing lines to represent the gentler, more innocent tunes of the early decades, and gradually become more chaotic, fragmented, and dark to reflect the increasing complexity and heaviness of modern pop music. Include a legend or key that explains the significance of the different colors, symbols, and charts used in the image. This will help viewers understand the emotional coding and interpret the journey more easily. Overall, the static image should tell a compelling visual story of how popular music has evolved emotionally over the decades. It should invite viewers to reflect on the changing nature of popular culture and the ways in which music reflects and shapes our collective emotional experiences. The image can be created using various graphic design tools such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, or even hand-drawn and digitized for a more organic feel. By including this evocative static image in the conclusion, you will leave a lasting impact on your readers and reinforce the key insights and takeaways from your data-driven story.</p></div>
