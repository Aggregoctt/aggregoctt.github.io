<div>  <p class="tag svelte-1csopdy">Two teenage wizards with a hostile rivalry fueled by jealousy and external political forces</p> <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Or, according to over 60,000 works of fanfiction on AO3: two characters with a deep well of sexual tension, just one butterbeer away from leaping headfirst into an enemies-to-lovers romance.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> These two are far from the only pair of men in popular media whose relationship has been reimagined by readers regardless of their sexualities or the source material. <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/James%20%22Bucky%22%20Barnes*s*Steve%20Rogers/works">James "Bucky" Barnes/Steve Rogers</a>, <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Castiel*s*Dean%20Winchester/works">Castiel/Dean Winchester</a>, and <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Sherlock%20Holmes*s*John%20Watson/works">Sherlock Holmes/John Watson</a>, and thousands more, are each the object of homoerotic fantasy.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd">Slash ships (M/M), or same-gender relationships between men, are far and away the most popular type of fanfic on AO3 when compared to femslash (F/F), straight relationships (F/M), friendships (Gen), and fanfic with other types of romantic relationships including more than two partners, ungendered original characters, and when the reader is inserted into the story (XReader).</p>       <h3 class="svelte-kxsvxe">Fanfics by Relationship</h3> <p class="svelte-kxsvxe">/</p>   <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">allShips 100%</p>  <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">M/M 52%</p>   <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">M/M 52%</p>    <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">F/M 18%</p>   <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">F/M 18%</p>    <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">Gen 14%</p>   <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">Gen 14%</p>    <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">Other 10%</p>   <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">Other 10%</p>    <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">F/F 6%</p>   <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">F/F 6%</p>        <p class="note svelte-qi8m9o">Note: Other includes romantic relationships including more than two partners, ungendered original characters, and when the author inserts themselves into the story (XReader).

Let&#8217;s take a look at the Top 50 fandoms on AO3.</p> <p class="svelte-1orxbul"> Here they are colored by the gender makeup of the main cast in the original media. Fandoms with more men are more blue and fandoms with more women are more neon green. On average, the top fandoms are 70% male.</p> <p class="svelte-1orxbul"> You might also notice that these fandoms mostly fall into the same genres: Fantasy, Science Fiction, Superhero, Video Game &#8212; ones that historically had fanbases of predominantly men. This can potentially be traced back to the origins of fandom itself &#8212; science fiction.</p>      <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Quick history lesson: In the 1920s, the science-fiction-only magazine <i><a href="https://amazingstories.com/">Amazing Stories</a></i> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a> gave birth to participatory fandom culture in America. The magazine allowed fans to correspond with each other through published letters. Later this same community &#8212; of mostly teenage boys &#8212; would expand into fanzines and conventions.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> When Star Trek the TV show premiered 40 years later, it instantly tapped into the already existing male-dominated fan base. This time, women wanted in too. However, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Jenkins">Henry Jenkins&#8217;</a> 1992 essay <a href="https://books.google.mw/books?id=CmmTAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">&#8220;Textual Poachers&#8221;</a>, the existing close relationships between authors and fans &#8220;created barriers to female fans, and this fandom&#8217;s traditions resisted inflection or redefinition.&#8221;</p> <p class="svelte-yxsohd">To subvert gatekeeping, women began to transform and reimagine the Star Trek universe into what we now know as fanfiction. Thus was born the iconic <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/James%20T*d*%20Kirk*s*Spock/works">James T. Kirk/Spock</a> pairing that served as the framework for generations of slash to come.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Fanfic originated out of fandoms that catered to men, which naturally led to more ships with characters who were men. Repeated exposure to men protagonists makes their perspective the default, leading to lots and lots of non-men writing about characters who are men.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> These genres also appeal to women, nonbinary, and queer authors because they allow them to flip the script from the heteronormative, straight, mainstream perspective.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Media grounded in historically men-dominated genres can adopt the internalized machismo or homophobia one might expect from a high school sports team. Haikyuu, an anime about a high school boy&#8217;s volleyball team, is one of the most popular fandoms for romantic ideation, despite having virtually no romance at all in the source material. Haikyuu is also a sh&#333;nen (boy in Japanese), meaning the series targets an  audience of teenage boys and is all the more straight-coded.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> In these universes, it is difficult for M/M relationships to exist, providing a tension ripe for fantasizing. These platonic relationships may not be all that platonic if they were in another setting or in an alternate universe. It&#8217;s this potential to shake up the &#8220;status quo&#8221; that appeals to lots of fanfiction authors.</p> <h3 class="svelte-hkab5u"> <span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">F</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">c</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">t</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">o</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">a</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">l</span> </span><span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">w</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">o</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">m</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span> </span><span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">a</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">r</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span> </span><span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">a</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">l</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">s</span> </span> </h3> <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Some of the same driving impulses to subvert the mainstream also play into how fanfiction authors approach women characters.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Since popular culture is catered to a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/second-read/the-invention-of-the-male-gaze">&#8220;male gaze&#8221;</a> that fetishizes women, fans struggle to identify with on screen women. Characters are often white, skinny, hyper-feminized, and lack agency, alienating fans looking to escape through characters they can relate to. Doctor Who, a show that has been running since 1963, did not have a <a href="https://thelearnedfangirl.com/black-representation-in-doctor-who-modern-era/">significant non-white woman character </a> until 2007.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Fanfiction that avoids women all together allows authors and readers to identify with either character.</p> <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> The quality of female characters is correlated with the types of fanfic authors will write. We can casually test this theory by contrasting two top fandoms, Harry Potter and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p> <h3 class="svelte-kxsvxe">Fandom Gender Dynamics</h3> <p class="svelte-kxsvxe">/</p>  <h3 class="svelte-12d0b92">Harry Potter</h3>     <h3 class="svelte-12d0b92">MCU</h3>      <p class="svelte-12d0b92"> Here are the unique characters from Harry Potter () and the Marvel Cinematic Universe () that appear in romantic ships with more than 1,000 fanfics on AO3.</p> <p class="svelte-12d0b92"> Although the wizarding world has a few notable women characters (looking at you Hermione Granger), women only account for % of Harry Potter&#8217;s shipped characters, compared to % in the MCU.</p> <p class="svelte-12d0b92"> And although Marvel does have a history of over sexualizing its women characters, it does get closer to gender parity with men accounting for just over half (%) of MCU shipped charcters, compared to % of the characters from Harry Potter.</p> <p class="svelte-12d0b92"> Let&#8217;s take a look at how each fandom&#8217;s gender dynamics impact who gets shipped. Here, the connecting lines are sized by the number of fanfics written about each pairing.</p> <p class="svelte-12d0b92"> First of, let&#8217;s start with common ground: Femslash ships in both fandoms make up about the same percent, with F/F pairings accounting for % of Harry Potter ships and % of ships in the MCU.</p> <p class="svelte-12d0b92"> Despite Harry Potter having more characters who are men than the MCU, and therefore more pure opportunities for slash pairings, M/M ships only make up % of Harry Potter ships, compared to % of MCU ships.</p> <p class="svelte-12d0b92"> We see the reverse of slash ships when looking at heterosexual ships. Even though the MCU is closer to a 50/50 gender split, fewer of its ships (%)  are F/M pairings in comparison to Harry Potter (%).</p> <p class="svelte-12d0b92"> Even though Harry Potter has fewer overall women characters, those characters are seen to be more developed and more dynamic than the women in the MCU, offering authors more opportunities to build stories. Interact with the squares to see each character&#8217;s connections.</p>      <h3 class="svelte-hkab5u"> <span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">T</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">h</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span> </span><span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">F</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">m</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">a</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">l</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span> </span><span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">g</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">a</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">z</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span> </span> </h3> <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> If popular culture is the &#8220;male gaze,&#8221; fanfic is the &#8220;female gaze.&#8221;</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Slash fic evens the playing field by making both characters the same gender. Authors, whatever their sexuality, who struggle to envision themselves in heterosexual relationships with complete mutual respect can subvert societal expectations and project whatever romantic dynamic they want to see onto fanfic.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Going back to the original science fiction ship, <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/James%20T*d*%20Kirk*s*Spock/works">James T. Kirk/Spock</a>, Joanna Russ writes that the fact that they are men is not incredibly relevant to the fantasy. It&#8217;s not about fetishizing gay male relationships (plus Spock is technically an alien), but rather providing an androgynous template to work from.</p> <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Authors of all genders and sexualities enjoy seeing men vulnerable, counter to typical socialization. Slash fics endow men with heaps of emotional vulnerability &#8212; despite characters having no indication of such abilities in the source media &#8212; allowing fanfic to fulfill a role that authors crave to witness.</p> <p class="svelte-yxsohd">The romance in fics also often progresses much slower and is filled with more yearning and drama than in popular media. For context, the <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010">most popular fic on AO3</a> is over 500,000 words long, while the first Harry Potter book is less than 80,000 words.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> This emphasis on relationship progression can be seen in AO3&#8217;s most popular tags, which include &#8220;fluff,&#8221; &#8220;angst,&#8221; &#8220;slow burn,&#8221; and &#8220;hurt/comfort.&#8221; The desire to see these patterns can be traced back to what Russ calls the  &#8220;sexualization of the feminine condition,&#8221; or  how women are socialized in society &#8212; to not initiate sex, to go slow with relationships, to be nurturing, to be fulfilled by complete monogamy.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Many of the most popular Supernatural <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Castiel*s*Dean%20Winchester/works">Castiel/Dean Winchester</a> fics involve scenarios where Dean must nurture Castiel&#8217;s broken wings (or other body parts) back to health in a way that is filled with agonizing misunderstandings, twitching, and delicious tenderness. It creates a scenario where emotional intensity is brought to the forefront.</p> <h3 class="svelte-hkab5u"> <span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">M</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span> </span><span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">a</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">r</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span> </span><span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">h</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">o</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">t</span> </span> </h3>  <p class="svelte-yxsohd">This perhaps is obvious, but many people are attracted to men. And people attracted to men like to fantasize about hot men.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> If we begin to split the tag data by relationship types &#8212; M/M, F/M, and F/F &#8212; we start to see different types of tags emerge in the Top 20 for each category. While there are many tags that overlap across the groups, there are more tags related to sexual acts, as opposed to relationship dynamics, for slash fics than for straight or femslash ships.</p>     <h3 class="svelte-kxsvxe">Top tags by relationship</h3> <p class="svelte-kxsvxe">/</p>    <p class="note svelte-1h0rbzn">Note: Although Alpha/Beta/Omega Dynamics (or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omegaverse" class="svelte-1h0rbzn">Omegaverse</a>) can exist in romantic, erotic, and sexual contexts it has been classified as a "sexual" tag because of its roots in erotic slash fanfiction and how it is largely used on AO3 today.</p> <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Authors enjoy shipping characters because they&#8217;re attractive and they want to see them together. Lucy Neville, author of &#8220;Girls Who Like Boys Who Like Boys,&#8221; explains the phenomenon as "the seemingly unradical notion that many women find men attractive, and therefore like looking at them, particularly without their clothes on."</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Much of slash fic is indeed pornographic. But, despite many fics having sexual elements, they are still often surrounded by hundreds of thousands of words of plot development.</p>     <p class="svelte-11jpkin">You've reached the end of this chapter. Use the top tab buttons or the side arrow buttons to switch between chapters.</p>   <p class="tag svelte-1csopdy">Two men (one human, one angel) working together to fight supernatural forces of evil.</p> <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Or, according to 100,000 works of fanfiction on AO3: two souls destined to find love amidst the chaos, transcending the boundaries between heaven, hell, and earth to be together.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> For shippers of <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Castiel*s*Dean%20Winchester/works">&#8220;Destiel&#8221;</a> (that&#8217;s the shipping portmanteau of &#8220;Dean&#8221; and &#8220;Castiel&#8221;), the wait was a long one. Initially introduced as a minor character in Season 4 of Supernatural, Castiel&#8217;s appearance would go on to spawn one of the biggest ships in internet history, building a legacy of fanfiction, art, video edits, zines, songs, theories, discussions, and conventions, all dedicated to exploring the rich subtext simmering beneath the surface between the two characters.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Like many other popular slash pairings in media, the romantic and sexual undertones that may or may not have existed between the lines were generally understood by fans to be &#8220;non-canon.&#8221; Non-canon broadly describes any ship, setting, plot, or other elements of the story that are not explicitly confirmed in the source material, but exist as alternative possibilities that fans can flesh out through fanfiction and other creative means. Those three seconds when Dean&#8217;s gaze seemed to linger on Castiel&#8217;s face? That&#8217;s inspiration for a 20,000 word romantic fic right there, regardless of what the scene originally meant to convey.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Ever since the <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/James%20T*d*%20Kirk*s*Spock/works">James T. Kirk/Spock</a> days, fans have been drawn to ships that exist beyond the canon of the original material. Non-canon ships make up the overwhelming majority of pairings on AO3, accounting for nearly twice as many ships that exist canonically.</p>     <h3 class="svelte-kxsvxe">Fanfics by canon status</h3> <p class="svelte-kxsvxe">/</p>        <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Of course, what counts as &#8220;canon&#8221; and &#8220;non-canon&#8221; can vary over the course of the story&#8217;s run. Destiel spent 12 years as a non-canon, largely fandom-driven ship until Castiel confessed his love for Dean before dying in the final episodes of Season 15, thus acknowledging their relationship as a semi-canonically romantic one&#8212;and blowing up the internet.</p>  <p class="svelte-yxsohd">This question of canonicity has long been a subject of contention. In the early A.D.s, religious leaders clashed over conflicting interpretations of the Bible (from which the term &#8220;canon&#8221; is derived from). Since at least the 18th Century, scholars have <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/22/11480192/shakepeare-400-anti-stratfordian-authorship-controversy">scrutinized and debated</a> who authored Shakespeare&#8217;s body of works. And in the internet age, fans spam gifs and think pieces at each other in a battle to prove which ship is more real. Ask any big fandom and they&#8217;ll probably be able to point you to the still-smoldering crater of some ship argument that invoked canonicity (or lack thereof) as a metric of superiority.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Given this endlessly recurring debate, it&#8217;s thus worth asking: Why are people way more invested in non-canon content than in the established canon?</p> <h3 class="svelte-hkab5u"> <span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">T</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">r</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">a</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">s</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">f</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">o</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">r</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">m</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">a</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">t</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">v</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span> </span><span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">s</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">t</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">o</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">r</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">y</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">t</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">l</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">l</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">g</span> </span> </h3> <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> As discussed in the slash section, there are a myriad of reasons why fandoms tend to be dominated by slash ships. Given the heteronormativity of mainstream media, it thus comes as no surprise that the majority of these ships are not canonical. Far from discouraging fans from shipping their favorite characters together, these non-canon ships instead allow plenty of room for speculation and exploration of the characters&#8217; dynamic &#8212; precisely because of, rather than despite, the absence of a romantic relationship.</p>      <h3 class="svelte-kxsvxe">Canon status of slash ships</h3> <p class="svelte-kxsvxe">/</p>       <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Subtext is the key factor here. Canon relationships are often bound to typical romance arcs that play out in conventional trajectories: the steamy &#8220;enemies to lovers,&#8221; the playful &#8220;will they or won&#8217;t they,&#8221; or the classic &#8220;happily ever after,&#8221; to name just a few. When writers work in elements like jealous misunderstandings or meaningful glances, they expect the audience to pick up on and follow the progression of this romance. It&#8217;s a predictable cue &#8212; not necessarily a bad one by any means, but certainly frequent and familiar in media.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> But what happens when the audiences flip the script and project these cues on the canon instead, subverting the intended narrative?</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> This experience then becomes transformative. Instead of adhering to the formulated storylines, fans can instead use the source material as a &#8220;<a href="https://henryjenkins.org/blog/2011/07/aca-fandom_and_beyond_harringt_1.html">springboard</a> for [their] own creative and analytical work&#8221;, pushing past the boundaries of the canon to reimagine new narratives. A quiet, fleeting moment between two characters can be reinterpreted as intimate. A heated confrontation between the hero and her enemy can become sexually charged. Such is the freedom of fanfiction: fans have the agency to interact with the story as if it were &#8220;<a href="https://books.google.mw/books?id=CmmTAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">a tangible place</a> they can inhabit and explore.&#8221;</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> For queer audiences, a relationship that appears unromantic on screen, but hints at a deeper emotional subtext under the surface may hit particularly close to home, reflecting their own experiences of navigating relationships and identities that may not be acknowledged or validated in their personal lives. Furthermore, rooting for a ship that you know will likely never materialize in the text also means not having to brace for the fallout of said relationship &#8212; no messy breakups, tragic endings, or unrealistic portrayals that often accompany queer relationships in mainstream media (like when The 100 <a href="https://www.autostraddle.com/all-65-dead-lesbian-and-bisexual-characters-on-tv-and-how-they-died-312315/">famously killed off</a> fan-favorite character Lexa right after she had sex with Clarke, sparking a wave of scrutiny against the <a href="https://www.themarysue.com/lexa-bury-your-gays/">Bury Your Gays</a> trope).</p> <p class="svelte-yxsohd">In this context, the ambiguity and open-endedness of non-canon ships allow fans to explore possibilities that go unaddressed and unfulfilled in the original text without the risk of being mishandled or cut short by the writers. Fans come together to swap theories, validate observations, share headcanons, and fill in the narrative gaps, forming a community where queerness is celebrated, studied, and foregrounded in a media landscape where it often lacks the attention or respect it deserves.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> While the allure of non-canon dynamics isn&#8217;t exclusive to slash ships (<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Fox%20Mulder*s*Dana%20Scully/works">Fox Mulder/Dana Scully</a> from The X Files originated the term &#8220;shipping,&#8221; after all), there&#8217;s a noticeable lack of them among the top femslash and straight ships.</p>   <h3 class="svelte-kxsvxe">Canon status by relationship</h3> <p class="svelte-kxsvxe">/</p>  <h5 class="svelte-8fgkn6">Slash (M/M)</h5> <p class="key-block key-block-canon svelte-8fgkn6">Canon</p> <p class="key-block key-block-semi svelte-8fgkn6">Semi-Canon</p> <p class="key-block key-block-non-canon svelte-8fgkn6">Non-Canon</p>    <p class="svelte-8fgkn6">Slash ships have always been predominantly non-canon, making up about 78% written on AO3 each year. No surprises there: mainstream media still defaults to straight male leads who receive the most storylines and fan attention &#8212; hence more ships.</p> <p class="svelte-8fgkn6"> In contrast, straight ships follow the opposite trend. While ships like <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Hermione%20Granger*s*Draco%20Malfoy/works">Hermione Granger/Draco Malfoy</a> and <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Bellamy%20Blake*s*Clarke%20Griffin/works">Bellamy Blake/Clarke Griffin</a> have boosted the rise in non-canon numbers, the most popular straight ships continue to be established couples from long-running franchises.</p> <p class="svelte-8fgkn6"> Meanwhile, femslash ships have seen the most significant non-canon shift, growing from just 3 ships with over 1,000 works in 2013 to 150 in 2024. The steady rise of non-canon ships in both live action and animated media indicates increasing attention to rich, complex female dynamics and a greater focus on female characters.</p>      <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Still, despite the long-running popularity of ships like <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Kara">Kara Danvers/Lena Luthor</a> and <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Evil%20Queen%20%7C%20Regina%20Mills*s*Emma%20Swan/works">Regina Mills/Emma Swan</a>, femslash remains the least popular ship genre on AO3. It&#8217;s still quite rare to see multiple female characters who are complex and interact within a shared narrative (as contemporaries, partners, or rivals), and even when they do, it&#8217;s easy to pass off intimate interactions between women as platonic rather than romantic. Furthermore, female characters are <a href="https://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2023-Its-a-Mans-Celluloid-World-Report.pdf">more likely to be paired up</a> with a partner or have their relationship status serve as a central plot point in their arc, often at the expense of developing deep connections with other characters.</p> <p class="svelte-yxsohd">It&#8217;s not all bleak for femslash shippers, though. <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Marlene%20McKinnon*s*Dorcas%20Meadowes/works">Marlene McKinnon/Dorcas Meadowes</a>, the #6 most popular femslash ship, has gained a cult following thanks to the explosive popularity of the <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Marauders">Marauders fandom</a>, despite each character only being mentioned once in the entire Harry Potter series.</p>     <h3 class="svelte-kxsvxe">Top ships by relationship</h3> <p class="svelte-kxsvxe">/</p>     <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Non-canon ships offer fans a creative outlet to explore relationships that are traditionally underrepresented in media, but their popularity may also encourage producers to exploit fan interest without actually providing meaningful representation on screen.</p> <h3 class="svelte-hkab5u"> <span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">Q</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">u</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">r</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">b</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">a</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">t</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">g</span> </span><span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">a</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">u</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">d</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">c</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">s</span> </span> </h3> <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> You may have noticed that most of these top ships feature characters whose sexualities are either established or treated by the canon as straight.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Often, the queering that happens in fanfiction isn&#8217;t just in the fans&#8217; heads.

Fans project onto these characters because there are simply more of them, and they&#8217;ve benefited from being around longer, with well-established tropes, greater attention, thriving fandom spaces, and richer development &#8212; unlike the often short-lived and underdeveloped stories about queer and female characters.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Sometimes, these non-canon ships draw more attention than queer ships that canonically exist in the show, and may especially overshadow <a href="https://fangirlish.com/2020/02/04/queerly-not-straight-prioritizing-white-queer-couples-over-those-of-color/">queer characters of color</a>.

In contrast, roughly a third of these characters are Asian (55 characters), while over half are white (134 characters).</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> It's a cyclical problem: mainstream media favors characters of certain archetypes, which influences fandoms to reflect these preferences, and which then reflects these preferences right back to mainstream media.

But even within a space designed for inclusivity, the characters that people love to fantasize about still tend to be overwhelmingly straight white men, reinforcing a feedback loop that continues to favor dominant identities in media.</p> <h3 class="svelte-hkab5u"> <span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">A</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">l</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">t</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">r</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">a</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">t</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span> </span><span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">U</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">v</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">r</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">s</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">s</span> </span> </h3> <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Subverting the canon can go beyond transforming enemies into lovers or friendship into sexual tension &#8212; the entire universe of the story can become a sandbox that&#8217;s ripe for reimagining.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Writers can transpose characters into new settings to explore how they would exist in a different environment, like mashing multiple fandoms together (think Harry Potter in the Avengers universe with Percy Jackson as his rival) or throwing them three thousand years back in time. It&#8217;s the ultimate practice of &#8220;what if?&#8221;, one that allows writers and readers to reimagine and reinterpret their favorite stories over and over in new and exciting ways.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> But the age-old adage &#8220;write what you know&#8221; applies here, too. Out of the 20 most popular Alternate Universe tags &#8212; where the setting itself, not just the characters, diverges from canon &#8212; nearly half are set in everyday circumstances like &#8220;high school&#8221; and &#8220;coffee shops&#8221; or transform extraordinary characters into &#8220;humans&#8221; with &#8220;no powers&#8221;.</p>    <h3 class="svelte-kxsvxe">Top 20 AU tags</h3> <p class="svelte-kxsvxe">/</p>        <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Beyond the wish fulfillment aspect of fanfiction, fans can also use these alternate universes as a vehicle to ask &#8220;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-promise-and-potential-of-fan-fiction">speculative and reflective</a> questions about their own lives.&#8221; Fanfiction can be a great medium to explore deeply personal questions through fictional &#8212; but just as real &#8212; scenarios. For example, what would it be like for Steve Rogers to come out at his high school? How might Dean Winchester deal with a quarter life crisis? How did Harry Potter cope with living in an abusive home? When fans come together to exchange comments and ideas, offer advice, or simply leave kudos on a fanfic, it might just help make life feel a little less lonely.</p> <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Ultimately, the fascination with non-canon fanfiction speaks to the interplay between creators, fans, and the story itself. It&#8217;s an old practice &#8212; older than the internet at least, going by those <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/James%20T*d*%20Kirk*s*Spock/works">James T. Kirk/Spock</a> zines from the 1980s &#8212; but as long as stories continue to inspire people, there&#8217;s just no limit to how far the imagination can go.</p>    <p class="svelte-11jpkin">You've reached the end of this chapter.

It&#8217;s the ultimate rewriting of &#8220;art imitating life&#8221; into &#8220;life imitating art.&#8221;</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Over the last 11 years, roughly 13% of the fanfiction on AO3 has been reserved for this type of storytelling, or Real Person Fiction (RPF).</p>   <h3 class="svelte-kxsvxe">Percentage of RPF ships</h3> <p class="svelte-kxsvxe">/</p>          <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Like all of fanfiction, RPF heavily skews slash (M/M) and non-canon, but even more so.

One group sings about wanting to &#8220;light it up like dynamite,&#8221; and the other builds Minecraft dynamite. So&#8230; not much in common at first glance.</p> <p class="svelte-yxsohd">But consider this, both fandoms come from cultures with rigid gender norms, especially around masculinity.</p> <h3 class="svelte-hkab5u"> <span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">R</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">w</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">r</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">t</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">g</span> </span><span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">M</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">&#8217;</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">s</span> </span><span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">R</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">o</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">m</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">a</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">c</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span> </span> </h3> <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> First up: BTS. They&#8217;re from South Korea, home to the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/data/indicators/gender-wage-gap.html">largest gender wage gap</a> of OECD member countries. The Washington Post&#8217;s Michelle Ye Hee Lee writes the country&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/21/south-korea-women-gender-equality-gap/">deep-seated view of women&#8217;s role in society</a> can be summed up in one Korean word: jib-saram, or &#8220;home person.&#8221; It&#8217;s a word for &#8216;wife.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> But the burden to conform to gender roles doesn&#8217;t stop with just women, men also must meet a certain stereotype of masculinity. In the 1990s, that was the Korean equivalent of a &#8220;finance bro,&#8221; a &#8220;salaryman&#8221; with expensive suits and luxury watches. But, K-pop has started to stretch and expand the country&#8217;s definition of what can be masculine. Enter K-pop inspired &#8220;flowerboys.&#8221;</p> <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> K-Pop artists are often instructed to play up this &#8220;versatile masculinity&#8221; and gender fluidity through <a href="https://esquiresg.com/korean-celebrities-fan-service-fan-meets-fan-cams-kpop/">&#8220;fan service,&#8221;</a> or the practice of pandering to the desires of fans. And, fans can be demanding.</p> <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Despite the lack of fan service by One Direction, fans still shipped <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Styles*s*Louis%20Tomlinson/works">Harry Styles/Louis Tomlinson</a>, famously causing friction in their relationship.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> But in the case of <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Jeon%20Jungkook*s*Park%20Jimin/works">Jeon Jungkook/Park Jimin</a>, everyone&#8217;s in on it, from BTS&#8217; management right down to BTS themselves. It&#8217;s intentional and orchestrated. Of course, it&#8217;s easy to instigate parasocial delusions when you&#8217;ve got a wink like Jimin&#8217;s.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> If they are flirting with each other, that means they are not flirting with other women, which means that there is a tiny glimmer of a chance they could date you. If you are playfully suggestive toward men and conveniently available for women, well, you&#8217;ve got the market on lock, as evidenced by the makeup of BTS ships: 41% are slash ships (M/M) and 23% are XReader ships, where the author inserts themselves in the storyline.</p>       <h3 class="svelte-kxsvxe">BTS Fanfics by Relationship</h3> <p class="svelte-kxsvxe">/</p>   <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">identity 92%</p>  <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">M/M 41%</p>   <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">XReader 23%</p>   <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">Other 20%</p>   <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">Gen 8%</p>       <p class="note svelte-qi8m9o">Note: Other includes romantic relationships with more than two partners and ungendered original characters.

South Korea, like much of Asia, has yet to legalize same-sex marriage or civil unions and lacks many other protections for queer people. Yet, arguably one of the country&#8217;s biggest exports &#8212; K-Pop &#8212; is built on purposefully romantic-ish relationships between men. And, the same playbook is being used for K-Pop girl groups to amplify same-gender relationships between women like Red Velvet&#8217;s <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Bae%20Joohyun%20%7C%20Irene*s*Kang%20Seulgi/works">Irene/Kang Seulgi</a>.</p><p class="svelte-yxsohd"> By creating slash ships of some of the biggest K-Pop stars, fanfic authors directly challenge this dichotomy, rewriting the current limits of masculinity, sexuality, and gender identity.</p> <h3 class="svelte-hkab5u"> <span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">R</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">w</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">r</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">t</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">g</span> </span><span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">M</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">&#8217;</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">s</span> </span><span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">F</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">r</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">d</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">s</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">h</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">p</span> </span> </h3>       <h3 class="svelte-kxsvxe">YouTube RPF Fanfics by Relationship</h3> <p class="svelte-kxsvxe">/</p>   <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">identity 100%</p>  <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">Gen 67%</p>   <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">M/M 26%</p>   <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">Other 4%</p>   <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">F/F 2%</p>   <p class="svelte-16o7k7l">F/M 2%</p>       <p class="note svelte-qi8m9o">Note: Other includes romantic relationships including more than two partners, ungendered original characters, and when the author inserts themselves into the story (XReader).

And in the rare chance that a queer storyline was included, they were often treated like <a href="https://www.publicbooks.org/queer-representation-videogames/#fn-50235-7">&#8220;side quests.&#8221;</a></p> <h3 class="svelte-hkab5u"> <span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">W</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">r</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">t</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">g</span> </span><span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">t</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">o</span> </span><span class="word svelte-hkab5u">    <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">x</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">i</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">s</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">t</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">n</span>   <span class="char hedspan-false svelte-hkab5u">c</span>   <span class="char hedspan-true svelte-hkab5u">e</span> </span> </h3> <p class="svelte-yxsohd"> Writing fanfic about BTS and YouTube vloggers is transformative work, turning the &#8220;side quest&#8221; into the &#8220;main quest,&#8221; where all of the swirling systemic, structural, and societal problems that plague your favorite real person can be erased with a flick of the wrist.
