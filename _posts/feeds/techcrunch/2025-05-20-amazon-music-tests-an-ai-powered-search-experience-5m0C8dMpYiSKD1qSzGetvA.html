<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Amazon Music announced Tuesday that it&#8217;s testing a new AI-powered search feature called &#8220;Explore,&#8221; designed to help fans learn more about their favorite artists.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">To use this feature, users can tap the &#8220;Find&#8221; button at the bottom of the screen and enter an artist&#8217;s name in the search bar. Then, by selecting the &#8220;Explore&#8221; tab at the top left, users can discover information about the artist, including collaborations with other singers, related artists they might not know, and highlights from their discography.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">For example, when users look up Jelly Roll, the AI will direct them to notable duets, such as &#8220;Save Me,&#8221; featuring Lainey Wilson. This feature also serves as a way for Amazon Music to promote its original content, like Jelly Roll&#8217;s exclusive cover of &#8220;Should&#8217;ve Been A Cowboy,&#8221; featuring T-Pain.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Additionally, users will have the option to create an AI-generated playlist. Last year, Amazon Music <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/16/amazon-music-follows-spotify-with-an-ai-playlist-generator-of-its-own-maestro/">launched</a> its answer to Spotify&#8217;s AI DJ, called Maestro, as part of its strategy to compete against the streaming giant. Incorporating Maestro into the Explore feature is likely aimed at encouraging more users to try out the AI playlist function.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While the goal of Explore seems to be to keep users engaged with the app for a longer period and connect with artists, it also comes a few months after Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/amazon-hikes-prices-for-its-music-unlimited-subscriptions/">raised the price</a> of its Music Unlimited subscription by $1, indicating an effort to encourage more users to pay the new cost of $11 with an enticing new feature.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Explore is rolling out today to select Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers in the U.S. on the iOS app. However, it is important to note that the beta feature is currently limited to only 10,000 artists, such as Bad Bunny and BLACKPINK, among others. </p>
