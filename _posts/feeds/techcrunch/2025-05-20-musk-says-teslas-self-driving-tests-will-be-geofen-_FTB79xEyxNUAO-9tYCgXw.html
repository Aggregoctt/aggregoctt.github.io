excerpt: The first test of Tesla&#8217;s long-promised robotaxi service in Austin,
  Texas next month will initially be limited to specific areas the company deems &#8220;the
  safest,&#8221; CEO Elon Musk told CNBC in an interview Tuesday. Tesla&#8217;s cars
  are &#8220;not going to take intersections unless we are highly confident [they&#8217;re]
  going to do well with that intersection, [&#8230;]

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">The first test of Tesla&#8217;s long-promised robotaxi service in Austin, Texas next month will initially be limited to specific areas the company deems &#8220;the safest,&#8221; CEO Elon Musk told CNBC in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/05/20/elon-musk-confirms-tesla-plan-for-robotaxis-on-austin-roads-in-june.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an interview</a> Tuesday.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Tesla&#8217;s cars are &#8220;not going to take intersections unless we are highly confident [they&#8217;re] going to do well with that intersection, or it&#8217;ll just take a route around that intersection,&#8221; Musk said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to be extremely paranoid about the deployment, as we should be. It would be foolish not to be.&#8221;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Using a geofence represents a major strategy shift for Musk, who spent years claiming his company would be able to create a general purpose self-driving solution that could be dropped in to any location and work without human supervision. (Geofence is a jargon term used in the autonomous vehicle industry that means vehicle is restricted to a certain area.) Musk has claimed Tesla will attempt to launch similar trials for its robotaxi service in California and possibly other states later this year.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Musk telegraphed the idea of using a geofence on Tesla&#8217;s first-quarter earnings call in April, though he did not explicitly say that was the approach the company would use. The CEO said at the time that it was &#8220;increasingly likely that there will be a localized parameter set&#8221; for its early robotaxi operations. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As part of Tesla&#8217;s &#8220;paranoid&#8221; approach, Musk said Tuesday the company will have employees remotely monitor the initial fleet of around 10 Model Y SUVs equipped with the &#8220;unsupervised&#8221; version of its Full Self-Driving software. Musk also claimed those vehicles will be driving without any safety operator inside.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s prudent for us to start with a small number, confirm that things are going well, and then scale it up proportionate to how well we see it&#8217;s doing,&#8221; he said. </p>
