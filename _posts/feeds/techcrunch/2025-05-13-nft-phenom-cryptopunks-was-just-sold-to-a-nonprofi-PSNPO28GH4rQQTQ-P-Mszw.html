The deal details are undisclosed, and a representative declined to comment. Back in April, NODE announced it received <a href="https://nodefoundation.com/blog/founding-grant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a $25 million grant</a> to &#8220;build the future of digital art&#8221; from investor Micky Malka and Becky Kleiner.

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Yuga Labs purchased CryptoPunks back in 2022 from Larva Labs amid the digital token craze that saw NFTs sell for millions of dollars. The highest-priced CryptoPunk NFT sold for nearly $24 million worth of crypto, according to the <a href="https://cryptopunks.app/cryptopunks/topsales?sortByUSD=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CryptoPunks website</a>.</p>
