title: YouTube viewers will start seeing ads after ‘peak’ moments in videos

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Imagine you&#8217;re watching a highly anticipated video from your favorite YouTube creator &#8212; perhaps the moment a famous couple finally gets engaged &#8212; when an ad pops up immediately after the clip. This is part of YouTube&#8217;s new ad format called &#8220;Peak Points.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company revealed the new ad format during its Upfront presentation on Wednesday in New York.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Peak Points leverages Google&#8217;s Gemini AI to analyze YouTube videos and identify moments it believes have the highest viewer engagement or are most emotionally impactful, and then suggests placing the ad right after it.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Point Peaks aims to benefit advertisers by using a tactic that aims to grab users&#8217; attention right when they&#8217;re most invested in the content. This approach appears to be similar to a strategy called <a href="https://www.wurl.com/success-story/monks-use-of-emotion-targeting-boosted-engagement-and-out-performed-other-campaign-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">emotion-based targeting</a>, where advertisers place ads that align with the emotions evoked by the video. It&#8217;s believed that when viewers experience heightened emotional states, it leads to better recall of the ads.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">However, viewers may find these interruptions frustrating, especially when they&#8217;re deeply engaged in the emotional arc of a video and want the ad to be over quickly to resume watching.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In related news, YouTube announced another ad format that may be more appealing to users. The platform debuted a shoppable product feed where users can browse and purchase items during an ad.</p>
