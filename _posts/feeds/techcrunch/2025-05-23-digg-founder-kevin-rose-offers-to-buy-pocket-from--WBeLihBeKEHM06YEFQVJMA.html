<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Digg, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a>-era link aggregator that&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/kevin-rose-and-alexis-ohanian-acquire-digg/">now being given a second chance at life</a>, is open to buying Mozilla&#8217;s read-it-later app, Pocket. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">On Thursday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/mozilla-is-shutting-down-read-it-later-app-pocket/">Mozilla announced it would shut down Pocket on July 8</a>, saying that the way people use the web has evolved, and it needed to focus on new areas of development. Shortly after, Kevin Rose, Digg&#8217;s original owner, now co-founder of the new Digg alongside Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/kevinrose/status/1925678269560434961">posted on X</a> that his company would be interested in acquiring Pocket from Mozilla.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Tagging both Mozilla and Pocket on the post, Rose wrote, &#8220;We love Pocket at Digg, happy to take it over and continue to support your users for years to come.&#8221; The post additionally tagged Betaworks founding partner Peter Rojas, previously the founder of Gizmodo and Engadget. </p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Neither Digg nor Mozilla has yet to respond to a request for comment on the news. However, the deal could be interesting if it went through, as Digg could leverage Pocket&#8217;s existing user base to fuel interest in its relaunch. Digg could potentially even integrate Pocket&#8217;s reading list with Digg, making it easier for users to find and share engaging content directly to the news aggregator. This could provide an initial pipeline for feeding news and articles into Digg while it worked to grow its user base. </p>
