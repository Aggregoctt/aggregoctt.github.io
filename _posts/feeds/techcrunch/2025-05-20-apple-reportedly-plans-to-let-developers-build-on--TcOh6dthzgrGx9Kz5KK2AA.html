<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Apple plans to release a new set of AI products and frameworks at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) this June, including tools that&#8217;ll let third-party developers create software using Apple AI models, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-20/apple-to-open-ai-models-to-developers-betting-that-it-will-spur-new-apps">per a Bloomberg report.&#160;</a></p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Apple&#8217;s hope is that expanding its AI tech in this way will draw more attention &#8212; and users &#8212; as the company looks to catch up with its competitors in the AI space. The new framework will let developers integrate Apple Intelligence across their apps, Bloomberg reports. The company is seeking to first allow developers to use its smaller models, according to the publication.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">WWDC this year will also reportedly see Apple overhaul its operating systems across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Apple is also set to release new device-specific capabilities, including one that helps manage battery life, and a new Health app &#8212; powered, of course, by AI (although the app reportedly won&#8217;t be ready until next year).</p>
