<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Cryptocurrency executives and other investors with significant wealth from crypto holdings are getting more serious about personal security, according to stories this weekend in both <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-industry-robberies-attacks-32c2867a?st=sYvFNE&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share">the Wall Street Journal</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-18/crypto-high-rollers-go-big-on-bodyguards-to-deter-kidnappers">Bloomberg</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While cryptocurrencies have always created unique security risks, it seems there&#8217;s a rising threat of violent abduction due to the growing value of Bitcoin, as well as new concerns after<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/15/coinbase-says-customers-personal-information-stolen-in-data-breach/"> a recent Coinbase breach exposed customers&#8217; personal information</a>. (Coinbase said the breach affected less than 1% of its customers.)</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">For example, three masked men recently attempted to abduct the daughter and granddaughter&#160;of the CEO of French cryptocurrency company Paymium, only to be driven off by the family&#8217;s neighbors.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Jethro Pijlman, who works for Amsterdam-based security and intelligence firm Infinite Risks International, told Bloomberg that his team is seeing &#8220;more inquiries, more long-term clients, and more proactive requests from crypto investors who don&#8217;t want to be caught off guard.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Meanwhile, Coinbase revealed in a regulatory filing that it spent $6.2 million in personal security costs for its CEO Brian Armstrong last year &#8212; more than the combined security costs for the CEOs of JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Nvidia.</p>
