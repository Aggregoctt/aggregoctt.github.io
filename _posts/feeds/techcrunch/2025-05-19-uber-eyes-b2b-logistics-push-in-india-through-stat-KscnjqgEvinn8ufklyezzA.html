<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Uber is entering India&#8217;s growing B2B logistics market by extending its partnership with the Indian government-backed nonprofit that aims to break the domination of the e-commerce duo Amazon and Walmart-backed Flipkart and widen digital commerce in the South Asian nation.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">On Monday, the ride-hailing giant announced it will soon launch its B2B logistics service through the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) to help businesses on the network access on-demand logistics through Uber&#8217;s 1.4 million driver network, without disclosing a specific timeline. The service will initially enable food deliveries for businesses operating on the open network, but is aimed to be expanded to e-commerce, grocery, pharmacy, and even healthcare logistics.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">With its new move, Uber will be available as a logistics service provider on ONDC, competing with the likes of Shiprocket (Temasek and PayPal-backed), Shadowfax (TPG, Qualcomm Ventures, and Eight Roads-backed), recent Indian unicorn Porter, and Tiger Global-backed Loadshare.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It will be a white-label service and will operate similarly to <a href="https://merchants.uber.com/uber-direct.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Uber Direct</a>, <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-ZA/blog/introducing-uber-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">launched</a> in the U.S. in 2020, but will be limited to businesses available on the ONDC network, a person familiar with the plan told TechCrunch.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Uber&#8217;s foray into B2B logistics in India follows the company&#8217;s expansion in the consumer logistics space by introducing <a href="https://entrackr.com/snippets/uber-rolls-out-logistics-service-courier-xl-for-delivery-of-large-goods-9061442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Courier XL</a> in Delhi NCR and Mumbai earlier this month to help users deliver large goods of up to 1,653 pounds from the company&#8217;s rider app by choosing three- and four-wheeler goods carriers. The company has also been offering its regular Courier package delivery service on two-wheelers for some time.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Eyeing logistics in general makes sense for Uber as the Indian logistics market is <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/shipping-/-transport/indian-logistics-market-to-expand-to-rs-13-4-trillion-by-fy28-report/articleshow/113898395.cms?from=mdr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">expected to grow 49%</a> to 13.4 trillion Indian rupees ($157 billion) in the financial year 2028 from 9 trillion Indian rupees ($105 billion) in the financial year 2023, per Motilal Oswal. The move will help Uber get another business case in India, after seeing a <a href="https://entrackr.com/fintrackr/uber-india-made-rs-807-cr-from-ride-hailing-in-fy24-8866883" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">41.1% year-over-year increase</a> in its operating revenue in the country to $439 million last year. Its last year&#8217;s results also showed collections from rides growing 21.45% YoY of the total operating revenue to $94.27 million.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Nonetheless, Uber is facing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/19/uber-ditches-commissions-in-favor-of-fees-for-auto-rickshaw-drivers-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing competition</a> in the Indian ride-hailing market from local players, including emerging ones like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/29/indias-rapido-becomes-unicorn-with-fresh-120-million-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rapido</a> (WestBridge Capital and Nexus Ventures-backed) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/15/google-backs-indian-open-source-uber-rival-namma-yatri/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Namma Yatri</a> (Google, Blume Ventures, and Antler-invested). Its diversification into new domains, such as logistics, is expected to help the San Francisco-based company maintain India as an important market.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Alongside its B2B logistics play, Uber has rolled out metro ticketing on its rider app powered by ONDC, based on the memorandum of understanding that the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/21/uber-ceo-says-firm-to-explore-integration-with-india-open-ondc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed</a> with the Indian government-backed nonprofit during CEO Dara Khosrowshahi&#8217;s visit to India in February 2024. Delhi Metro tickets are available first through the Uber app, while metro tickets in three more Indian cities will go live later this year.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Launched in 2021, ONDC debuted as India&#8217;s initiative to boost digital commerce and allow small retailers to go online and reach more customers easily. The network also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/23/india-government-backed-open-e-commerce-network-expands-to-mobility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expanded to the mobility sector</a> in 2023.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">ONDC was initially designed to replicate the success of the Indian government&#8217;s Unified Payments Interface, aiming to drive digital commerce adoption. However, it has struggled to gain traction, as its open-network model has yet to win over major industry players. <a href="https://retail.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/e-commerce/e-tailing/ondc-ceo-t-koshy-steps-down-amid-leadership-reshuffle/120147516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Recent leadership churn</a> has added to its challenges, with even its former managing director and CEO, T. Koshy, stepping down last month. Retail orders on the network also <a href="https://opendata.ondc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">declined by nearly 34%</a> to 4.3 million in April from a peak of 6.5 million in October.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Uber&#8217;s initial enablement of metro ticketing and logistics unlocks new possibilities &#8212; from seamless multimodal journeys to unifying a fragmented logistics ecosystem,&#8221; said Vibhor Jain, acting CEO and COO at ONDC, in a prepared statement. &#8220;This collaboration lays the foundation for future innovations from Uber on the network, enhancing value for users, partners, and the broader mobility and services landscape.&#8221;</p>
