---
<div>
<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">U.K. retail giant Marks &amp; Spencer has confirmed hackers stole its customers&#8217; personal information during a cyberattack last month.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/MKS/cyber-incident-further-update/17033373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a brief statement</a> with London&#8217;s stock exchange on Tuesday, the retailer said an unspecified amount of customer information was taken in the data breach. The BBC, which <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62v34zv828o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first reported the company&#8217;s filing</a>, cited a Marks &amp; Spencer <a rel="nofollow" href="https://corporate.marksandspencer.com/cyber-update">online letter</a> as saying that the stolen data includes customer names, dates of birth, home and email addresses, phone numbers, household information and online order histories.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company also said it was resetting the online account passwords of its customers.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Marks &amp; Spencer continues to experience disruption and outages across its stores, with some grocery shelves remaining empty after the hack affected the company&#8217;s operations. The company&#8217;s online ordering system for customers also remains offline.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It&#8217;s not clear how many individuals&#8217; data was stolen during the hack. When reached by TechCrunch, Marks &amp; Spencer spokesperson Alicia Sanctuary would not say how many individuals are affected and referred TechCrunch to its online statement. Marks &amp; Spencer had 9.4 million online customers <a href="https://corporate.marksandspencer.com/sites/marksandspencer/files/2024-06/M-and-S-2024-Annual-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as of 30 March 2024, per its most recent annual report</a>.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A ransomware and extortion gang called DragonForce reportedly took credit for the cyberattacks on several U.K. retail giants, including Marks &amp; Spencer, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grn878712o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">per media reports</a>.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">U.K. retailers the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/uk-retail-giant-co-op-warns-of-disruption-as-it-battles-cyberattack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Co-op</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/01/nx-s1-5383911/harrods-department-store-cyberattack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Harrods</a> were also targeted by hackers at around the same time as Marks &amp; Spencer was hacked. The Co-op initially said there was no evidence that data was compromised, but later said the hackers had stolen customer data. In an update <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coop.co.uk/cyber-incident-faqs">to its website</a>, the Co-op said customer names, dates of birth, home and email addresses, and phone numbers were exfiltrated.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkx3vy54nzo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported last week</a> that DragonForce claimed it had the private information of 20 million people who signed up to Co-op&#8217;s membership program, including current and former members. </p>
