<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Netflix is adding more live streaming content, the company <a rel="nofollow" href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-upfront-2025-the-center-of-attention">announced</a> at its Upfront presentation on Wednesday. The service, which now reaches over 94 million global monthly active users, has been steadily introducing live TV to its audience with sports content from WWE wrestling, comedy, and awards shows, and other special events (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/17/netflix-issues-love-is-blind-livestream-reunion/">some of which definitely</a> didn&#8217;t work out.)</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">According to Netflix Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria, the company will be adding new programs, including the Katie Taylor vs. Amanda Serrano rematch fight on July 11. A new deal with the NFL will also see the company stream two Christmas Day matchups: the Dallas Cowboys at the Washington Commanders and the Detroit Lions at the Minnesota Vikings.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In addition, Netflix will live stream the 32nd Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards on March 1, 2026 and will stream its own &#8220;Netflix Tudum 2025: The Live Event&#8221; at the end of this month.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">These will join the weekly streams of WWE events currently hosted on the service. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company also pitched to advertisers its Netflix Ads Suite, which can now incorporate first-party data from either LiveRamp or Netflix itself (thanks to new first-party measurement solutions) and is expanding its programmatic ad buying options, among other things. One new ad format will also use generative AI to match ads to Netflix shows.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In addition to touting its lineup of new and returning shows and movies, the company also hyped its Gen Z and millennial reach to advertisers, noting that Netflix is watched by more 18- to 34-year-olds than any other U.S. broadcast or cable network, and that consumers on the U.S. ad-supported tier watch an average of 41 hours per month.</p>
