<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">During the Android Show leading up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/09/google-i-o-2025-what-to-expect-including-updates-to-gemini-and-android-16/">Google I/O</a>, Google on Tuesday offered a brief update on the adoption of the RCS (Rich Communication Services) protocol, an upgrade to SMS that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services#Features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">offers</a> high-resolution photos and videos, typing indicators, read receipts, improved group chat, and more. The company shared that the messaging standard now supports over a billion messages per day in the U.S.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This metric is based on an average of the last 28 days, Google noted.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The stat is notable because Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/09/google-new-campaign-pressure-apple-adopting-rcs/">fought for years </a>to get Apple to adopt support for <a href="https://www.android.com/get-the-message/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RCS on iOS</a>, allowing for better communication between Android and Apple devices. Previously, iPhone users who received texts from friends on Android had to deal with blurry videos and images, and couldn&#8217;t as easily manage group chats when their green-bubbled friends joined. Unlike with iMessage, group chats with Android users couldn&#8217;t be renamed, nor could people be added or removed, and you couldn&#8217;t exit when you wanted. Emoji reactions also didn&#8217;t work properly, leading to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/10/googles-message-app-can-now-handle-imessage-reactions-challenges-apple-with-new-features/">annoying texts</a> to let you know how an Android user reacted, instead of just displaying their emoji reaction directly.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">That changed with the fall 2024 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/16/ios-18-review/">launch of iOS 18</a>, when Apple finally added RCS support to its Messages app. Though the functionality has been upgraded, Apple still displays RCS chats as green bubbles, hoping to keep the stigma of being an Android user intact. This is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/why-apples-imessage-is-winning-teens-dread-the-green-text-bubble-11641618009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">particularly important among young people</a> in the U.S., where demand for the blue bubbles has cemented the iPhone as teens&#8217; most popular device.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Surprisingly, Google did not share other stats around RCS, like those detailing the number of users more specifically or the carrier support. </p>
