<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Epic Games claims that Apple is blocking its Fortnite app from the U.S. and E.U. App Stores. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/epic-games-just-scored-a-major-win-against-apple/">winning a decisive victory for app developers</a> in a legal battle with Apple, forcing the tech giant to allow external payments in its U.S. App Store without charging commission, Epic Games attempted to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1920878504284975585">resubmit Fortnite to the U.S. App Store</a> on May 9, 2025.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">However, Apple failed to accept its submission for a week, leading Epic Games to pull its request and try again. According to Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1922724874264412295">update was pulled because</a> Epic Games needs to release a weekly Fortnite update with new content, and all platforms must be updated simultaneously. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company then submitted a new version to the U.S. App Store for review on Wednesday, May 14, with the updated content. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In a Friday morning post on X, Fortnite said that Apple has blocked its latest U.S. submission and has made it so Epic Games can&#8217;t release its app to the European Union, either. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it,&#8221; the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923293522234356169">post from Fortnite reads</a>. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">TechCrunch reached out to Epic Games and Apple to learn more and will update if further information is provided. </p>
