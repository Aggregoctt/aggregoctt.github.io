<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Semiconductor giant AMD followed through with its plan to spin out ZT Systems&#8217; server-manufacturing business.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1252/amd-announces-agreement-to-divest-zt-systems-data-center-infrastructure-manufacturing-business-to-sanmina" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AMD announced</a> on Monday that it was selling ZT Systems&#8217; server-manufacturing business to electronic manufacturing services company Sanmina. The $3 billion deal is a mix of cash and stock: $2.25 billion in cash; a $300 million premium, including 50% cash and 50% equity; and a $450 million contingent payment based on financial performance over the next three years, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sanmina-buy-zt-systems-manufacturing-business-amd-3-billion-deal-2025-05-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to Reuters</a>.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The deal is expected to close by the end of 2025, subject to regulatory approval. After this divestiture, AMD will maintain control of ZT Systems&#8217; rack-scale AI solutions design business.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This announcement isn&#8217;t a shock. When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/19/amd-to-acquire-infrastructure-player-zt-systems-for-4-9b-to-amp-up-its-ai-ecosystem-play/">AMD announced its intent to acquire ZT Systems</a>, an AI and cloud infrastructure company, for $4.9 billion in August 2024, the company said at the time that it planned to divest that part of ZT Systems&#8217; business after the deal formally closed. AMD&#8217;s acquisition of ZT Systems officially closed in March 2025, according to Reuters.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Alongside this announcement, AMD said that Sanmina will become a &#8220;preferred&#8221; new product introduction manufacturing partner for AMD cloud rack and cluster-scale AI solutions.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8203;&#8203;&#8220;By combining the deep experience of our AI systems design team with our new preferred NPI partnership with Sanmina, we expect to strengthen our U.S-based manufacturing capabilities for rack and cluster-scale AI systems and accelerate quality and time-to-market for our cloud customers,&#8221; said Forrest Norrod, executive vice president and general manager, data center solutions business unit at AMD, in the company&#8217;s announcement.</p>
