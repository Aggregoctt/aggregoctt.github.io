<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Android users will have more ways to find their devices and other items, Google announced on Tuesday during the Android Show, a week before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/09/google-i-o-2025-what-to-expect-including-updates-to-gemini-and-android-16/">Google I/O 2025</a>. The company says its Find My Device feature, which allows Android users to locate lost phones and other devices, will become known as &#8220;Find Hub&#8221; as it rolls out support for more partners, satellite-based finding capabilities, and airline partnerships.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Initially introduced as an Android-based alternative to Apple&#8217;s Find My service in 2013, Find My Device <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-find-my-device/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">expanded just over a year ago</a> with the introduction of a crowdsourced finding network that could locate personal belongings via third-party Bluetooth trackers and tags, like those from Chipolo, Pebblebee, and others.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Now Google is unveiling more partners that will work with its service using built-in location tracking capabilities.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This includes built-in luggage finding from brands like <a href="http://july.com/luggage/find-my-carry-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">July</a> and <a href="https://mokobara.com/pages/find-your-mokobara" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mokobara</a>, a way to locate lost skis with built-in <a href="https://pebblebee.com/peak-loc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Peak</a> integration, and new Bluetooth tags aimed at families from <a href="https://pixbee.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pixbee</a>. Later this month, Android users will also be able to use ultra-wideband (UWB) technology to locate Motorola&#8217;s <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/en/p/motoaccessories/all-moto-tags/pg38c06068?srsltid=AfmBOopcty9asFVU6LV1qKheYrQgYtfUHeaI4utuX7ZK_EsNGU-y811c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">moto tags</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company says support for satellite-based finding will roll out later in 2025.</p>
