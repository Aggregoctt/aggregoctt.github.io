<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Apple sent invites for its developer-focused event, Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), which will be held from June 9 to June 13 with an &#8220;On the horizon&#8221; tagline.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company will likely announce new versions of its operating systems, namely iOS 19, iPadOS 19, watchOS 12, macOS 16, and visionOS 3. The developer conference is both in person and online, with Apple introducing online group sessions for the first time, according to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/">the announcement page</a>.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company will also announce a slew of Apple Intelligence-related features. Reports suggest that these will include <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-12/apple-plans-ai-powered-battery-management-mode-for-devices-in-ios-19">intelligent battery management</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-30/apple-readies-biggest-push-into-health-yet-with-revamped-app-ai-doctor-service-m8vl97k2">a virtual health assistant</a>. The company announced Apple Intelligence last year with much fanfare, but it has yet to hit the mark among users.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Apple has slowly rolled out features like AI-generated emojis, images, and email summaries. However, it had to pause <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/16/apple-pauses-ai-notification-summaries-for-news-after-generating-false-alerts/">news summaries in notifications</a> after inaccurate headlines. Plus, it hasn&#8217;t shipped the new version of Siri that integrates with apps, and has admitted that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/ai-powered-more-personalized-siri-is-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the rollout is delayed</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16, Apple will reportedly bring a ton of visual changes with a design language <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/apples-next-major-os-updates-will-bring-the-biggest-design-overhaul-in-years/">that will be in line with the visionOS</a> user interface. A report from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/apple-readies-dramatic-design-overhauls-for-ios-19-ipados-19-and-macos-16">Bloomberg</a> noted that the company will revamp icons, menus, apps, windows, and system buttons while simplifying navigation and control.</p>
