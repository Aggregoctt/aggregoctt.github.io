<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/WizardLM_AI">WizardLM</a>, a Beijing-based Microsoft AI research group, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/WizardLM_AI/status/1922307494837186998">appears to have joined</a> Tencent, the Chinese company that owns WeChat and blockbuster games like PUBG Mobile. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/CanXu20/status/1922303283890397264">post on X on Tuesday</a>, Can Xu, a senior AI researcher who led a number of projects within WizardLM, said that he and the team left Microsoft to join Hunyuan, one of Tencent&#8217;s AI development orgs. Over the past few months, Hunyuan has released AI models including video and 3D object generators.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">WizardLM has already released a Hunyuan-branded model, in fact: Hunyuan-TurboS 0416. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/victorsungo/status/1921984195938910342">In an X post</a>, Qingfeng Sun, who claims to be a &#8220;co-founder&#8221; of WizardLM, says that Hunyuan-TurboS 0416 outperforms &#8220;open&#8221; AI models like Google&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/12/googles-gemma-ai-models-surpass-150m-downloads/">Gemma 3 series</a>. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It&#8217;s not clear how many researchers are still a part of WizardLM or when the team might&#8217;ve left Microsoft. We&#8217;ve reached out to both Tencent and Microsoft for comment.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">WizardLM, formed several years ago, has a bit of a strange history.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Last April, the team, then under Microsoft, released a family of AI models, WizardLM-2, that it said was competitive with OpenAI&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/11/openai-is-winding-down-its-gpt-4-ai-model-in-chatgpt/">GPT-4</a>. But after only a day, Microsoft pulled WizardLM-2 from the web, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/WizardLM_AI/status/1780101465950105775">saying</a> that the models hadn&#8217;t undergone &#8220;toxicity testing.&#8221; </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;We accidentally missed an item required in the model release process &#8212; toxicity testing,&#8221; the WizardLM team wrote in a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/WizardLM_AI/status/1780101465950105775">post on X</a> on April 16, 2024. &#8220;We are currently completing this test quickly and then will re-release our model as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The deletion came a little too late. Users quickly reuploaded the original WizardLM-2 models as well as customized, fine-tuned versions. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Meanwhile, in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://huggingface.co/posts/clem/583952430077847">a post on the AI dev platform Hugging Face</a>, Hugging Face CEO Cl&#233;ment Delangue&#160;said that Microsoft&#8217;s move, which also wiped out other WizardLM models, harmed the Hugging Face community by breaking a number of open source projects. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;[The WizardLM] models were collectively downloaded over a hundred thousand times a month,&#8221; Delangue wrote at the time. &#8220;We apologize for the inconvenience &amp; are trying to get in touch with the author [and] Microsoft in order to try to find a good resolution for community members.&#8221;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At Tencent, it seems WizardLM will keep doing what it was doing, more or less: developing and releasing AI models. Tencent <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.techinasia.com/news/tencent-restructures-ai-unit-adds-teams-foundational-models">recently restructured</a> its Hunyuan team, establishing two new units and upping its AI infrastructure spending.</p>
