<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan continues to consider ways to help semiconductor giant refocus on its core business.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Intel is allegedly considering selling its networking and edge unit, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-explores-sale-networking-edge-unit-sources-say-2025-05-20/">according to reporting to Reuters</a>, as Tan looks to shed business divisions that aren&#8217;t considered critical. This unit builds makes chips for telecom equipment and was responsible for $5.8 billion of revenue in 2024.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Intel has started engaging with potential buyers but has not launched a formal sales process, Reuters reported.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">If Intel does end up pursuing a sale, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising. Tan has made it clear that he wants the company to refocus on its core business units &#8212;&#160;PCs and data center chips. In March, Tan told Intel&#8217;s customers that the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/lip-bu-tan-says-intel-will-spin-off-non-core-units/">would spin off its non-core assets</a> at the company&#8217;s Intel Vision conference.</p>
