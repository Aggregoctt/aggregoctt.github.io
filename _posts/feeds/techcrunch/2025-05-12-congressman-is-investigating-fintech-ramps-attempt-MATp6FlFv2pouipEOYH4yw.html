<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Rep. Gerald Connolly, ranking member of the U.S. House Oversight Committee, has initiated an investigation into whether expense management startup Ramp is receiving preferential treatment in its bid for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/ramp-is-trying-to-get-the-us-government-as-a-customer-after-seeing-a-tweet-from-doge/">a $25 million government contract</a>.</p>

News of the probe was first reported by <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/investigation-ramp-gsa-smartpay-trump-peter-thiel-gerald-connolly?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ProPublica</a>.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Among Connolly&#8217;s biggest concerns are that Ramp allegedly has &#8220;zero federal contracting experience&#8221; and its investors include a number of Trump allies and supporters. Those investors include Peter Thiel&#8217;s Founders Fund, Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures, Thrive Capital (founded by Josh Kushner, brother of Trump&#8217;s son-in-law Jared), vocal Trump supporter <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/trump-ally-joe-lonsdale-targets-1b-for-his-new-8vc-fund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">8VC</a>&#8217;s Joe Lonsdale, and Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and brother of former Republican President George W. Bush. Rabois, according to Connolly&#8217;s letter, raised more than $1 million for Donald Trump&#8217;s 2024 campaign.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Connolly is requesting several things from the GSA, including a detailed list of all meetings&#160;between any GSA official and any Ramp representative, and all communications between any GSA official, contractor, or subcontractor and any Ramp representative.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The government&#8217;s internal expense card program, dubbed SmartPay, is a $700 billion program. Currently, Citibank and US Bank, two of the nation&#8217;s largest suppliers of credit cards, are the official banks of the current <a href="https://smartpay.gsa.gov/about/master-contract/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SmartPay contract.</a></p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In April, Ramp&#8217;s head of communications, Lindsay McKinley, confirmed to TechCrunch that the startup was &#8220;competing in a standard procurement process for a SmartPay pilot program based on the strength of our solution.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">She claimed that the startup Ramp saw <a href="https://x.com/DOGE/status/1892053072169275822" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a public post on X</a> shared by the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE, on February 18 that said &#8220;the US government currently has ~4.6M active credit cards/accounts, which processed ~90M unique transactions for&#160; ~$40B of spend in FY24.&#8221;</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A former customer, Ramp claims, introduced Ramp to GSA a few days later.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">However, Connolly alleges that Ramp reportedly began contacting entities in the payment industry about special bank identification numbers required to process government payments before a request for information (RFI) related to the contract was publicly announced.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">He also claimed that a GSA employee recently stated that Ramp was the &#8220;favorite&#8221; to win this business.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Ramp did not have any comment on Connolly&#8217;s investigation.</p>
