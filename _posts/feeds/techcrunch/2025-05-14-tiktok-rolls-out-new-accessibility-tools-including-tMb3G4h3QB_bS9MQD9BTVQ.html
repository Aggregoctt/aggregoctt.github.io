<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">TikTok announced on Wednesday that it&#8217;s expanding its suite of accessibility tools by rolling out AI-generated ALT text for photos, a high contrast mode, and support for device-level bold text preferences.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">TikTok introduced support for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/tiktok-adds-support-for-alt-text-for-photos/">ALT text for photos</a> a few weeks ago, allowing creators to provide descriptive text for photos to help users with screen readers understand the visual content through spoken descriptions. Now, the company is testing AI-generated ALT text&#160;to automatically describe photos out loud when creators don&#8217;t add alt text manually.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company says AI-generated ALT text will make TikTok more accessible for people with visual impairments. The move comes as Instagram has been <a href="https://help.instagram.com/503708446705527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">using AI for ALT</a> text since 2018. </p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As for the new high contrast mode, users will be able to switch it on with the new &#8220;color contrast&#8221; option in the app&#8217;s accessibility section. Doing so will increase the foreground color of text, icons, and user interface elements. This change will make TikTok more usable for people with low vision or sensitivity to low contrast, the company says.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">TikTok now also adheres to a user&#8217;s device&#8217;s bold text setting, which means that it will automatically display all in-app text in bold when enabled. This enhances readability for users who prefer or rely on bolder fonts.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;We know that when people feel seen, heard, and supported, they&#8217;re empowered to share their stories, create and connect with others in meaningful ways,&#8221; the company said in a blog post. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re focused on continuously building products that serve everyone.&#8221; We see accessibility not just as a responsibility, but as an opportunity to innovate and foster a more inclusive platform for our global community.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The new features join TikTok&#8217;s existing suite of accessibility tools, which includes features like auto-generated captions for video content, dark mode, text-to-speech, and the ability to adjust text size across the app.</p>
