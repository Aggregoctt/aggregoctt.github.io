  data

<div>
<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">A senior Trump administration official has scrapped a plan that would have blocked data brokers from selling Americans&#8217; personal and financial information, including Social Security numbers.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said in December 2024 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/03/us-agency-proposes-new-rule-blocking-data-brokers-from-selling-americans-sensitive-personal-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it planned to close a loophole</a> under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the federal law that protects Americans&#8217; personal data collected by consumer reporting agencies, such as credit bureaus and renter-screening companies. The rule would have treated data brokers no differently than any other company covered under the federal law and would have required them to comply with the law&#8217;s privacy rules.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The rule was withdrawn early Tuesday, according to <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2025-08644/protecting-americans-from-harmful-data-broker-practices-regulation-v-withdrawal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">its listing in the Federal Register</a>. The CFPB&#8217;s acting director, Russell Vought, who also serves as the director of the White House&#8217;s Office of Management and Budget, wrote that the rule is &#8220;not aligned with the Bureau&#8217;s current interpretation&#8221; of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Wired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-quietly-kills-rule-to-shield-americans-from-data-brokers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first reported</a> the rule change on Wednesday.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Data brokers are part of a multibillion-dollar industry of companies that profit from collecting and selling access to vast amounts of Americans&#8217; personal and financial information. This personal data is then sold to other companies, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/13/us-intelligence-report-purchase-americans-personal-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">law enforcement and intelligence agencies</a>, often without the explicit permission of the individuals.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Collecting huge banks of data also comes with inherent risks. Over the past year, at least two data brokers were hacked, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/national-public-data-the-hacked-data-broker-that-lost-millions-of-social-security-numbers-and-more-files-for-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spilling millions of Social Security numbers online</a> and exfiltrating <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/gravy-analytics-data-broker-breach-trove-of-location-data-threatens-privacy-millions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a huge trove of user location data</a> that tracked millions of people&#8217;s whereabouts.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In 2024 alone, the Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/19/ftc-ban-inmarket-location-sale-sharing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned&#160;several data brokers</a> from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/03/ftc-bans-two-data-brokers-from-collecting-and-selling-americans-sensitive-location-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collecting and sharing data on individuals</a> without their permission, following allegations of unlawfully tracking people.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Privacy advocates have long called for the government to use the Fair Credit Reporting Act to rein in data brokers.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The decision by CFPB to cancel the rule comes days after the Financial Technology Association, an industry lobby group representing banking and fintech companies, wrote to Vought in his capacity as the White House&#8217;s budget director. The lobby group asked the administration to withdraw the CFPB&#8217;s rule, claiming it would be &#8220;harmful to financial institutions&#8217; efforts to detect and prevent fraud.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">CFPB did not return a request for comment.</p>
