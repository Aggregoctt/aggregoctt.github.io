<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">AI startup Cohere has acquired <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ottogrid.ai/">Ottogrid</a>, a Vancouver-based platform that develops enterprise tools for automating certain kinds of high-level market research. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Sully Omarr, one of the founders of Ottogrid, announced the deal Friday in a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/SullyOmarr/status/1923436453524029738/photo/1">post on X</a>. He didn&#8217;t disclose the terms.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Ottogrid will sunset its product, according to Omarr, but give customers &#8220;ample notice&#8221; and &#8220;a reasonable transition period.&#8221; </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;We&#8217;re very excited to join the Cohere team and integrate Ottogrid into Cohere&#8217;s [&#8230;] platform,&#8221; Omarr said in a statement. &#8220;Through our work with Cohere, we&#8217;re [going to] dramatically impact how people can automate their workflows, enrich their data, and scale their operations.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Cohere didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Cohere&#8217;s purchase of Ottogrid comes as the former experiences a bit of corporate turbulence. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/cohere-revenue-falls-85-short-target#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20model%20developer%20Cohere,the%20end%20of%20last%20year.">According to The Information</a>, Cohere fell well short of revenue projections the company prepared in early 2023,&#160;missing its target for last year by 85%. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/ai-firm-cohere-doubles-annualized-revenue-100-million-enterprise-focus-2025-05-15/">told Reuters</a> on Thursday that its annualized revenue recently reached $100 million, following a strategic shift with a focus on private AI deployments for customers in sectors like healthcare, government, and finance. </p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Ottogrid launched in 2023 as Cognosys, led by Omarr and Homam Malkawi. It rebranded in October 2024 with a major platform redesign that introduced a number of new integrations, tools, and APIs.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Today, Ottogrid offers a &#8220;native table interface&#8221; with AI-powered document analysis capabilities. Customers can use it to extract data from a website and save it directly to a spreadsheet, for example, or automatically enrich sales lead lists. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Ottogrid managed to raise $2 million in venture capital from investors including GV (Google&#8217;s venture arm), Untapped Capital, Replit CEO Amjad Masad, Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch, Cohere co-founders Ivan Zhang and Aidan Gomez, and others prior to its exit, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cognosys-815a">according to Crunchbase</a>. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As part of Cohere, Omarr says that Ottogrid will focus primarily on North, Cohere&#8217;s recently launched ChatGPT-style application designed to assist knowledge workers with tasks such as summarizing documents.</p>
