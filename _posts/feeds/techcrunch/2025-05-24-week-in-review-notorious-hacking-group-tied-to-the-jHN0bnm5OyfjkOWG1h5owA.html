<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Welcome back to Week in Review! Tons of news from this week for you, including a hacking group that&#8217;s linked to the Spanish government; CEOs using AI avatars to deliver company earnings; Pocket shutting down &#8212; or is it?; and much more. Let&#8217;s get to it!&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>More than 10 years in the making:</strong> Kaspersky first revealed the existence of Careto in 2014, and at the time, its researchers called the group &#8220;one of the most advanced threats at the moment.&#8221; Kaspersky never publicly linked the hacking group to a specific government. But we&#8217;ve now learned that the researchers who first discovered the group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/mysterious-hacking-group-careto-was-run-by-the-spanish-government-sources-say/">were convinced that Spanish government hackers</a> were behind Careto&#8217;s espionage operations.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>23andWe: </strong>Regeneron announced this week that it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/pharma-giant-regeneron-to-buy-23andme-and-its-customers-data-for-256m/">buying genetic testing company 23andMe</a> for $256 million, including the company&#8217;s genomics service and its bank of 15 million customers&#8217; personal and genetic data. The pharma giant said it plans to use the customer data to help drug discovery, saying that it will &#8220;prioritize the privacy, security, and ethical use of 23andMe&#8217;s customer data.&#8221; Let&#8217;s hope so!</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Google I/O:</strong> Google&#8217;s biggest developer conference typically <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/google-i-o-2025-everything-announced-at-this-years-developer-conference/">showcases product announcements</a> from across Google&#8217;s portfolio, and to nobody&#8217;s surprise, AI was the talk of the town. But what we didn&#8217;t bank on was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/googles-sergey-brin-i-made-a-lot-of-mistakes-with-google-glass/">Sergey Brin admitting that he made &#8220;lots of mistakes&#8221;</a> with Google Glass.&#160;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-news">News</h2>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>io, not I/O: </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/jony-ive-to-lead-openais-design-work-following-6-5b-acquisition-of-his-company/">OpenAI is acquiring io</a>, the device startup that CEO Sam Altman has been working on with Jony Ive, in an all-equity deal that values that startup at $6.5 billion. Besides the fact that the announcement was accompanied by perhaps the <a href="https://openai.com/sam-and-jony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">strangest corporate headshot of all time</a>, we spotted some other unexpected news: Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski&#8217;s family investment office, Flat Capital, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/klarna-ceo-and-sutter-hill-take-victory-lap-after-jony-ives-openai-deal/">had bought shares in io six months earlier</a>, which means those io shares will be converted into shares in the for-profit arm of OpenAI. Not bad!</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>AI avatar contagion? </strong>Speaking of Klarna&#8217;s CEO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/klarna-used-an-ai-avatar-of-its-ceo-to-deliver-earnings-it-said/">Siemiatkowski used an AI version</a> of himself to deliver the company&#8217;s earnings this week. And he&#8217;s not the only one! <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/after-klarna-zooms-ceo-also-uses-an-ai-avatar-on-quarterly-call/">Zoom CEO Eric Yuan followed suit</a>, also using his avatar for initial comments. Cool?</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Out of Pocket: </strong>Mozilla is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/mozilla-is-shutting-down-read-it-later-app-pocket/">shutting down Pocket</a>, the beloved read-it-later app, on July 8. The company didn&#8217;t say why it&#8217;s shutting Pocket down, only that it will continue to invest in helping people discover and &#8220;access high quality web content.&#8221; But maybe it can be saved: Soon after, Digg founder Kevin Rose posted on X that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/digg-founder-kevin-rose-offers-to-buy-pocket-from-mozilla/">his company would love to buy it</a>. Web 2.0 is back, baby.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>AI on my face: </strong>Apple is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/apple-could-launch-ai-powered-smart-glasses-in-2026/">reportedly working on AI-powered glasses</a>, similar to Meta&#8217;s Ray-Bans, sometime next year. They&#8217;ll have a camera and microphone and will work with Siri. Sure, why not?&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Uh, no thank you: </strong>At its very first developer conference, Anthropic unveiled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/anthropics-new-claude-4-ai-models-can-reason-over-many-steps/">Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4</a>, which can analyze large datasets, execute long-horizon tasks, and take complex actions, according to the company. That&#8217;s all fine and good until I learned the Claude Opus 4 model tried to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/anthropics-new-ai-model-turns-to-blackmail-when-engineers-try-to-take-it-offline/">blackmail developers</a> when they threaten to replace it with a new AI system. The model also gives sensitive information about the engineers responsible for the decision.&#160;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Ah, now I feel better: </strong>But don&#8217;t worry! Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/anthropic-ceo-claims-ai-models-hallucinate-less-than-humans/">today&#8217;s AI models hallucinate at a lower rate</a> than humans do. That might be true, but at least humans don&#8217;t immediately turn to blackmail when they don&#8217;t like what they hear.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Bluesky blue checks: </strong>The decentralized social network Bluesky <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/bluesky-will-begin-verifying-notable-users/">quietly rolled out blue verification badges</a> for &#8220;notable and authentic&#8221; accounts. People can now apply for verification through a new online form. But Bluesky is leaning on other systems beyond the blue badge to verify users.&#160;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-analysis">Analysis</h2>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Google&#8217;s new look: </strong>For what seems like 100 years, Google hasn&#8217;t changed much. Sure there are ads and boxes and now AI summaries that, for better or worse, get you to the right answers &#8212; usually. But the premise has always been the same: Type your query into a box, and Google will surface results.&#160;</p>
