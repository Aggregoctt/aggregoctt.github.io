<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">President Donald Trump is expected to sign the Take It Down Act today, a bipartisan law that enacts stricter penalties for distributing non-consensual explicit images, including deepfakes and revenge porn.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The bill criminalizes the publication of such images, whether they&#8217;re authentic or AI-generated. Whoever publishes the photos or videos can face criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment, and restitution.&#160;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Under the new law, social media companies and online platforms must remove such material within 48 hours of notice from the victim. The platforms also have to take steps to delete duplicate content.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Many states have already banned sexually explicit deepfakes and revenge porn, but this will be the first time federal regulators step in to impose restrictions on internet companies.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">First Lady Melania Trump lobbied for the bill, which was sponsored by Senators Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Cruz said he was inspired to act after hearing that Snapchat refused for nearly a year to remove an AI-generated deepfake of a 14-year-old girl.&#160;</p>
