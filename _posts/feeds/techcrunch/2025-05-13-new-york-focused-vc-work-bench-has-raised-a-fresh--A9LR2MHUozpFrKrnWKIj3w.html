<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Work-Bench, whose portfolio includes unicorns Spring Health and Socure, just raised a $160 million Fund IV to quadruple down on backing companies in New York City.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The firm announced the raise<a href="https://www.work-bench.com/post/announcing-work-bench-fund-iv-160m-to-back-seed-founders-with-bold-enterprise-visions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> in a blog post </a>on Monday, saying the latest fund will support seed-stage founders building enterprise software. Checks will range from $2 million to $4 million, and the team is looking specifically for companies building in AI, cybersecurity, developer tools, and enterprise applications.&#160;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Jonathan Lehr, the firm&#8217;s co-founder, told TechCrunch that the company hopes to invest in 23-25 companies out of Fund IV. He said that this was the smoothest fundraise yet for his firm, owing to the fact that Work-Bench has stayed &#8220;disciplined&#8221; since launching in 2013, &#8220;which matters more than ever in today&#8217;s AI frenzied environment.&#8221;</p>
