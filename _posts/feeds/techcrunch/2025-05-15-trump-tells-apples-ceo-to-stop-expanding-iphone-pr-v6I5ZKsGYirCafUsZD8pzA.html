title: Trump tells Appleâ€™s CEO to stop expanding iPhone production in India
---
<div>
<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Earlier this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company would start importing iPhones manufactured in India to meet the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/01/apple-ceo-tim-cook-says-tariffs-to-add-900m-in-costs-in-q3/">majority</a> of demand stateside. It seems U.S. President Donald Trump is not happy with that.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Speaking at a business summit in Doha, Trump <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOgVU4b-eEI">said</a> he met with Cook and asked him to stop building in India and instead increase production in the United States.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;I said to him, &#8216;Tim, you&#8217;re my friend, I&#8217;ve treated you very good. You&#8217;re coming up with $500 billion, but now I hear you are building all over India. I don&#8217;t want you building in India. You can build in India, if you want to take care of India because India is one of the highest tariff nations in the world&#8217;,&#8221; Trump said.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Trump, who has been on a tariff offensive against most of the world, said Apple would now be &#8220;upping&#8221; production in the U.S., though he didn&#8217;t give a timeline or any specifics.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Earlier this year, Apple said that it would spend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/24/apple-commits-500b-to-us-manufacturing-including-a-new-ai-server-facility-in-houston/">$500 billion over the next four years</a> to expand manufacturing in the U.S. by setting up facilities in various locations, opening new units, hiring over 20,000 people, and opening a manufacturing academy.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Trump&#8217;s comments come a day after India approved <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/foxconn-gets-nod-for-435m-project-to-make-more-of-apple-chips-in-india-eventually/">a $435 million Foxconn project</a> to manufacture Apple chips in the country. The company has had ambitious plans to ramp up production in India and create alternative manufacturing units that reduce its reliance on China. </p>
