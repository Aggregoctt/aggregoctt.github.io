<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Three years ago, I wrote about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/14/the-amazonification-of-uber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazonification of Uber,</a> an evolution of the transportation company into a closed business loop that feeds customers back into other Uber channels. At the time, the focus was on how Uber creates customer stickiness by, for example, actively cross-selling food delivery customers into grocery, and grocery into alcohol, and then alcohol back into mobility.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Today, Uber appears to be moving beyond its focus on transportation and working to become a convenient super app, an aggregator of services, a daily-use lifestyle platform with its best offerings tucked behind a paywall.&#160;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Case in point: Uber this week is launching its first Uber One Member Days, the company&#8217;s own version of Amazon&#8217;s Prime Day. Prime Day is a two-day shopping event exclusively for Amazon Prime members, a consumerist hype fest that leads people to spend more than they normally would on material objects because THE DEALS!&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Amazon has seen sales rise every year since launching the event in 2015, and last year, the company is estimated to have topped<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/amazon-prime-day-14-billion-in-sales-expected-record-high/477134#:~:text=In%20the%20past%20decade%20that,$7.16%20billion%20to%20$10.39%20billion." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> $14 billion in sales</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Uber is a long, long way away from achieving such scale, but the potential is there given the company&#8217;s global presence, logistics technology, and network of drivers &#8211; both gig and autonomous.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The first Uber One Member Day goes from May 16 to 23 and promises tens of thousands of deals across Uber&#8217;s own product lineup as well as its various retail and hospitality partners.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Uber customers will have access to 20% off Uber Black, 30% off Uber Reserve, and 40% off Uber Comfort. Other deals include:&#160;</p>
 

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="wp-block-list-item">3,000 Delta Skymiles points for people who&#8217;ve linked their Delta and Uber accounts and taken 10 trips during the week.&#160;</li>



<li class="wp-block-list-item">Oura rings discounts.</li>



<li class="wp-block-list-item">$20 off your next Ticketmaster purchase if you spend $3 on groceries.</li>



<li class="wp-block-list-item">Free food from almost every fast food restaurant, including a Chipotle burrito, a Dunkin&#8217; Donuts iced coffee, and a 10 piece chicken nuggets from McDonald&#8217;s.&#160;&#160;</li>
</ul>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;We want to create delight for Uber One members,&#8221; Sachin Kansal, Uber&#8217;s chief product officer, told TechCrunch. &#8220;This should be a great savings period for them. But also for folks who are not members right now, it&#8217;s a great way for them to get an introduction into membership as they become members during this period.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Uber is always working to grow its Uber One membership base, which is at around 30 million members today. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said during the company&#8217;s first-quarter earnings call last week that members &#8220;tend to have high retention.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;They spend three times more than non-members, as well,&#8221; Khosrowshahi said.&#160;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As Uber works to aggregate more partnerships outside of food and grocery delivery (just look at its recent tie-up with Home Depot) and combine those deals with its membership program, the company is mirroring Amazon&#8217;s evolution. Amazon started as a digital bookseller. Then it began selling everything. Now it also owns the infrastructure for both e-commerce and digital life, whether that&#8217;s AWS cloud services or Prime Video.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">For many, Amazon is a way of life. With Uber One Member Days, the company is signaling that it, too, wants that kind of ubiquity. And it&#8217;s betting that asset-light mobility &#8211; not packages delivered in Rivian vans &#8211; could be the next backbone of digital consumer culture.</p>
