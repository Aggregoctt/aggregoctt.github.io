<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Kaplan will take TC Sessions: AI attendees behind the scenes on hybrid reasoning models &#8212; which balance quick responses to simple queries with deeper processing for complex problems &#8212; and share insights into <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Anthropic</a>&#8216;s risk-governance framework for mitigating potential AI risks. (Kaplan was appointed Anthropic&#8217;s responsible scaling officer in October.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-get-to-know-kaplan">Get to know Kaplan</h2>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jared-kaplan-645843213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jared Kaplan</a> has a pretty remarkable r&#233;sum&#233;. Before co-founding Anthropic, he spent 15 years as a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University, exploring quantum gravity, field theory, and cosmology. Since then, his research on scaling laws has been credited with revolutionizing how the AI industry understands and predicts the behavior of advanced systems. In fact, before Anthropic, Kaplan played a role in developing GPT-3 and Codex at OpenAI; meanwhile, at Anthropic, Kaplan helped develop Claude, the company&#8217;s family of AI assistants.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It&#8217;s been a wild ride for Kaplan and company. Anthropic&#8217;s remarkable growth has been fueled by several major developments in just recent months alone, including its launch of <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Claude 3.7 Sonnet</a> in late February, which the company described as its &#8220;most intelligent model yet&#8221; and the first hybrid reasoning model that can handle both simple and complex queries with appropriate processing time for each.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company more recently introduced an autonomous research capability and Google Workspace integration, transforming Claude into what Anthropic has characterized as a &#8220;true virtual collaborator&#8221; for enterprise users.<br>(Anthropic is reportedly developing a voice assistant feature for Claude to compete with similar offerings from other AI companies.)</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Unsurprisingly, investors have noticed. In March, Anthropic announced that it had completed a new fundraising deal that valued the company at $61.5 billion, up from about $16 billion roughly a year earlier. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-get-the-inside-track-on-ai-with-big-ticket-savings">Get the inside track on AI with big ticket savings</h2>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-ai/?utm_source=tc&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=tcsessionsai2025&amp;utm_content=earlybird&amp;promo=post_jaredkaplan_04292025&amp;display=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TechCrunch Sessions: AI</a></strong>, Kaplan will share his vision for how AI will transform human-computer interaction, work processes, and social dynamics. But beyond the theoretical and technical aspects, Kaplan will offer tactical takeaways for teams of all sizes that are looking to implement AI and maximize its impact.</p>
