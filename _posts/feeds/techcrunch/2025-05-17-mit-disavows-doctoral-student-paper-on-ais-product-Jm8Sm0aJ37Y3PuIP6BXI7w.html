title: MIT disavows doctoral student paper on AI’s productivity benefits

<div>
<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">MIT says that due to concerns about the &#8220;integrity&#8221; of a high-profile paper on the effects of artificial intelligence on the productivity of a materials science lab, the paper should be &#8220;withdrawn from public discourse.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The paper in question, &#8220;Artificial Intelligence, Scientific Discovery, and Product Innovation,&#8221; was written by a doctoral student in the university&#8217;s economics program. It claimed to show that the introduction of an AI tool into a large-but-unidentified materials science lab led to the discovery of more materials and more patent filings, but at the cost of reducing researchers&#8217; satisfaction with their work.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">MIT economists Daron Acemoglu (who recently<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2024/press-release/"> won the Nobel Prize</a>) and David Autor both praised the paper last year, with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/will-ai-help-hurt-workers-income-productivity-5928a389">Autor telling the Wall Street Journal</a> he was &#8220;floored.&#8221; In a statement included in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://economics.mit.edu/news/assuring-accurate-research-record">MIT&#8217;s announcement</a> on Friday, Acemoglu and Autor described the paper as &#8220;already known and discussed extensively in the literature on AI and science, even though it has not been published in any refereed journal.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">However, the two economists said they now have &#8220;no confidence in the provenance, reliability or validity of the data and in the veracity of the research.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/mit-says-it-no-longer-stands-behind-students-ai-research-paper-11434092?st=sF3Wvo&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">According to the WSJ</a>, a computer scientist with experience in materials science approached Acemoglu and Autor with concerns in January. They brought those concerns to MIT, leading to an internal review.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">MIT says that due to student privacy laws, it cannot disclose the results of that review, but the paper&#8217;s author is &#8220;no longer at MIT.&#8221; And while the university&#8217;s announcement does not name the student, both <a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17866">a preprint version of the paper</a> and the initial press coverage identify the author as Aidan Toner-Rodgers. (TechCrunch has reached out to Toner-Rodgers for comment.)</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">MIT also says it has requested the paper be withdrawn from The Quarterly Journal of Economics, where it was submitted for publication, and from the preprint website arXiv. Apparently only a paper&#8217;s authors are able to submit arXiv withdrawal requests, but MIT says &#8220;to date, the author has not done so.&#8221;</p>
