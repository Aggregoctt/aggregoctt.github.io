<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/storyline/google-i-o-2025-live-coverage-gemini-android-16-updates-and-more/">Google I/O 2025</a>, the company unveiled a slew of new AI Workspace features coming to Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Vids. Most notably, Gmail is getting personalized smart replies and a new inbox-cleaning feature, while Vids is getting new ways to create and edit content.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Personalized smart replies in Gmail will help you draft emails that match your context and tone. The feature will show details from your past emails and Google Drive to provide response suggestions with relevant information. Google says the feature will get rid of the need to dig through your inbox and files for yourself. Personalized smart replies will also adapt to your tone, whether it&#8217;s formal or conversational.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As for the new inbox cleanup feature, Gemini can now help you delete or archive emails you no longer need. For example, you can tell Gemini to &#8220;Delete all of my unread emails from The Groomed Paw from last year.&#8221;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Gmail is also getting a new feature designed to help you quickly schedule appointments and meetings with people outside of your organization. With this feature, you can easily offer times for customers or clients to book a meeting or appointment with you. Gemini will detect when you&#8217;re trying to set up a meeting and surface the new feature. Google says the new capability will reduce the time and effort spent coordinating schedules.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">All of these new Gmail features will be generally available in a few months.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Over on Docs, you can now link any decks, data, and reports directly into a Google Doc and Gemini will only pull from these sources when providing writing assistance. Google says this will keep suggestions focused on trusted content. This way, whether you&#8217;re working on a research summary or a business plan, you are writing with the correct and relevant context. This new feature is generally available starting today.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google also announced that Google Vids is getting the ability to turn existing Google Slides into videos. With this feature, you could turn a sales deck or a quarterly business review presentation into a video. Google notes that Gemini can help generate scripts, voiceovers, animations, and more. The feature will be generally available in a few months.</p>
 

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Plus, for companies that don&#8217;t have the budget to film videos or the right spokesperson, Vids is launching AI avatars that will deliver their message. You can write a script and then choose an avatar to present that message for you in a polished video. Google says that the new feature could be used to create videos for onboarding, announcements, product explainers, and more. AI avatars will be available in Google Labs next month.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In addition, Vids is getting a new &#8220;transcript trim&#8221; tool that will automatically remove filler words, such as &#8220;um&#8221; and &#8220;ah,&#8221; from your videos. Users will also be able to adjust sound levels across their entire video with a new &#8220;balance sound&#8221; feature. Balance sound will be generally available next month, while transcript trim will be available in Labs in a few months.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google also revealed that users will be able to create more detailed visuals with Imagen 4, its latest image-generating model, in Workspace. The tech giant says this will allow users to create more detailed visuals in Slides, Vids, Docs, and more.</p>
