<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">OpenAI is reportedly considering building data centers in the United Arab Emirates to greatly expand its Middle East footprint. A deal could be announced as soon as this week, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-13/openai-weighs-uae-data-center-deal-as-trump-set-to-visit">according to Bloomberg</a>. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As Bloomberg notes, OpenAI has a long relationship with the UAE. In 2023, the company partnered with Abu Dhabi&#8217;s AI firm G42, which last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/27/openais-6-5b-funding-round-may-close-as-soon-as-next-week/">received</a>&#160;a $1.5 billion investment from OpenAI backer&#160;Microsoft. Meanwhile, an investment vehicle overseen by an Emirati royal family member, MGX,&#160;participated&#160;in a recent OpenAI funding round and plans to&#160;contribute&#160;to OpenAI&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/12/openais-stargate-project-reportedly-struggling-to-get-off-the-ground-thanks-to-tariffs/">Stargate</a> AI infrastructure project.</p>
