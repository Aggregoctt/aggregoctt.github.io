<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Spotify is launching a new hub dedicated to keeping users informed about soon-to-be-released albums, the company <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-05-21/upcoming-releases-hub-countdown-pages-charts-discovery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> on Wednesday. The hub, called &#8220;Upcoming Releases,&#8221; will feature personalized recommendations based on a user&#8217;s listening history.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Users will be able to access it through the Search tab on mobile in the &#8220;Browse all&#8221; section. The hub will also feature the top 10 global Countdowns, which are the most anticipated upcoming releases based on the number of pre-saves. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The hub will allow users to pre-save upcoming releases&#160;and view <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/08/spotify-introduces-countdown-pages-and-its-own-stories-feature/">Countdown Pages</a>, which showcase the track list of future albums and released singles. These pages also feature merch and clips from artists. Once users pre-save upcoming releases, they will receive a push notification from Spotify on the day of the release. Plus, Spotify will automatically add the music to their library.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The new hub will enhance music discovery on the platform by giving users recommendations for future albums that align with their interests. It also makes it easier for listeners to stay on top of future releases that they&#8217;re looking forward to by allowing them to quickly pre-save them. For artists, the new hub could allow for more exposure for their upcoming releases. The hub could also enhance the discovery of their Countdown Pages, and therefore, merch and tour information.  </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Spotify also announced that it&#8217;s rolling out Countdown Charts on its Spotify and Spotify for Artists social channels on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and X. These charts will showcase the top 10 Countdowns on Spotify with the most total pre-saves globally. The charts will be updated every Wednesday, the company says.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The announcement comes as Spotify has been updating its app with additional functionality over the past few weeks. Earlier this month, the music streaming service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/spotifys-latest-update-gives-users-more-control-over-their-listening-experience/">redesigned its app</a> to give users more control over their listening experience and recommendations. The redesign includes new features to help users manage their Queue, current listening experience, playlist creation, and more.</p>
