excerpt: Kesha may have taken the dollar sign out of her name, but now, the singer
  is thinking about money again &#8212; not for herself, but to fund the seed round
  of her new startup, Smash. According to Kesha&#8217;s Instagram post, Smash will
  be a &#8220;community-based platform to connect and protect music creators,&#8221;

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Kesha may have <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.vulture.com/2014/03/kesha-got-rid-of-her-dollar-sign.html">taken the dollar sign out</a> of her name, but now, the singer is thinking about money again &#8212; not for herself, but to fund the seed round of her new startup, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.smashmusic.io/">Smash</a>. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">According to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJ9jYzwurcB/?igsh=MWE5MHlsNWtmdmhyaA%3D%3D&amp;img_index=3">Kesha&#8217;s Instagram post</a>, Smash will be a &#8220;community-based platform to connect and protect music creators,&#8221; which aligns with the mission of her new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kesha-launches-her-own-record-label-1235109990/">eponymous record label</a>, which she announced last year.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The 38-year-old chart-topper has always been more than a glitter-clad party girl singing about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP6XpLQM2Cs">brushing her teeth with Jack Daniel&#8217;s</a>. Beneath her infectious 2010s pop music is a darker story &#8212; one in which she felt <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/22/1183894048/kesha-dr-luke-settlement">stripped of her power</a>, both as an artist and a person, by a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/14/16135214/kesha-new-album-lawsuit">predatory record deal</a> that she signed when she was a teenager.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/kesha-finally-free-millions-dollars-litigation-dr-luke-1236076250/">traumatic public legal battle</a> with her producer, Kesha now says that she is a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYIySDzTZug">&#8220;free woman,&#8221;</a> and she&#8217;s making new music. Both her label, Kesha Records, and the app Smash seek to help others make music without compromising their creative rights.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;I want a place where artists and music makers of any kind can have community, they can collaborate, they can hire each other and retain all the rights to everything they create,&#8221; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wired.com/story/kesha-smash/">Kesha said</a> in an interview with WIRED. &#8220;There&#8217;s no gatekeeping of contacts.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">She went on to describe the app as &#8220;LinkedIn for music creators,&#8221; or a &#8220;Fiverr-style marketplace.&#8221; The difference is that Smash plans to prioritize artists&#8217; rights at every stage.</p>
