<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Meta is launching a new program to incentivize startups to adopt its Llama AI models. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The program, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-startup-program/">Llama for Startups</a>, provides companies &#8220;direct support&#8221; from Meta&#8217;s Llama team, as well as funding in certain cases. Any U.S.-based firm that is incorporated, has raised less than $10 million in funding, has at least one developer on staff, and is building generative AI applications is eligible to apply by the May 30 deadline.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Members may receive up to $6,000 per month for up to six months to help them offset the costs of building and enhancing their generative AI solutions,&#8221; Meta wrote in a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-startup-program/">blog post</a>. &#8220;Our experts will work closely with them to get started and explore advanced use cases of Llama that could benefit their startups.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The launch of the Llama startup program comes as Meta tries to cement its lead in the fiercely competitive open model space. While the tech giant&#8217;s Llama models have racked up&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/meta-says-its-llama-ai-models-have-been-downloaded-1-2b-times/">more than a billion downloads to date</a>, rivals such as DeepSeek, Google, and Alibaba&#8217;s Qwen threaten to upend Meta&#8217;s efforts to establish a far-reaching model ecosystem.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Not helping matters, Llama has suffered several setbacks over the past few months. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Wall Street Journal last week <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-is-delaying-the-rollout-of-its-flagship-ai-model-f4b105f7">reported</a> Meta has delayed the rollout of a flagship AI model, Llama 4 Behemoth, over concerns the model underperforms on key benchmarks. In April, Meta had to&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/07/meta-exec-denies-the-company-artificially-boosted-llama-4s-benchmark-scores/">fend off allegations that it cheated on a popular crowdsourced AI benchmark</a>, LM Arena. The company used a version of its Llama 4 Maverick model &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/06/metas-benchmarks-for-its-new-ai-models-are-a-bit-misleading/">optimized for conversationality</a>&#8221; to achieve a high score on LM Arena, but released a&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/11/metas-vanilla-maverick-ai-model-ranks-below-rivals-on-a-popular-chat-benchmark/">different version</a>&#160;of Maverick publicly.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Meta has huge ambitions for Llama &#8212; and its broader generative AI portfolio. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://chatgptiseatingtheworld.com/2025/04/30/meta-forecasts-ai-will-rake-in-460b-to-1-4-trillion-in-revenues-for-meta-by-2035-should-that-affect-fair-use-analysis/">Last year</a>, the company made a prediction its generative AI products would rake in $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue in 2025, and between $460 billion and $1.4 trillion by 2035.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Meta has&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/meta-has-revenue-sharing-agreements-with-llama-ai-model-hosts-filing-reveals/">revenue-sharing agreements</a>&#160;with some companies that host its Llama models. The company recently&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/meta-previews-an-api-for-its-llama-ai-models/">launched an API</a>&#160;for customizing Llama releases. And Meta AI, the company&#8217;s AI assistant powered by Llama, may eventually show ads and offer a subscription with additional features, CEO Mark Zuckerberg&#160;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659242/mark-zuckerberg-is-planning-a-premium-tier-and-ads-for-metas-ai-app">said</a>&#160;during the company&#8217;s Q1 earnings call.</p>
