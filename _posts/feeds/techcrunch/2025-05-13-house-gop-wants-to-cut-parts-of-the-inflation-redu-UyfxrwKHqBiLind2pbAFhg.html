title: House GOP wants to cut parts of the Inflation Reduction Act while sparing others
---
<div>
<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Republican leadership in the Ways and Means committee of the U.S. House of Representatives released Monday night a draft of a reconciliation bill that seeks to undo much of the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/16/winners-losers-abound-as-inflation-reduction-act-becomes-law/">landmark 2022 law</a> implemented a range of incentives that spurred the production of clean energy, electric vehicles, carbon capture, and battery storage. Since the IRA was enacted, the law has spurred <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cleaneconomytracker.org">more than $275 billion</a> in private investment in the United States.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">House Republicans&#8217; axe has fallen in places both expected and surprising.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Under the &#8220;expected&#8221; column: Electric vehicle tax credits and the ability to transfer tax credits for clean energy production from one organization to another.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The EV tax credit gives consumers up to a $7,500 tax credit on the purchase of an EV; the bill proposes ending the credit in 2026 and reinstating a cap of 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer. Several companies, including Tesla, GM, and Toyota, hit that cap years ago.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The transferability clause has spurred an entirely new market, with over $30 billion worth of deals happening in 2024 alone. The provision allows companies and other organizations to take advantage of IRA tax credits even if they have no tax liability. A church, for example, can install solar panels and sell the tax credits to companies that can make use of the incentives.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">There were more surprising changes, too.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Nuclear power, normally a favorite of GOP lawmakers, would no longer benefit from tax credits for electricity generation. The law would also end tax-exempt status for environmental groups if the government decides that they have &#8220;supported terrorist organizations.&#8221; Advanced manufacturing would also see incentives cut back, as would tax credits for carbon capture, something that many large oil companies have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/21/the-real-reason-why-oil-and-gas-companies-are-bullish-on-carbon-capture/">publicly supported</a>.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Sustainable aviation fuel is among the technologies that might see its incentives spared, as were bonuses for clean energy producers known as &#8220;adders.&#8221; The House bill also does not seek to claw back funds that have already been spent, contrary to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/19/epa-was-arbitrary-and-capricious-when-it-froze-nonprofits-citibank-accounts-judge-finds/">what&#8217;s happening</a> at the EPA. The House bill would move up the date for which large projects can qualify for incentives.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">None of this is set in stone, of course. This is a first draft at a process that&#8217;s certain to be drawn out and messy. Lobbyists and political action committees are already rolling out pressure campaigns to dissuade GOP politicians from voting in favor, and they have a chance at succeeding given how many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/tracking-the-ev-battery-factory-construction-boom-across-north-america/">Republican districts have benefited</a> from the IRA in just a few years.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Whether such an ambitious repeal of an existing law will pass muster under reconciliation rules also remains an open question. The process allows for a simple majority vote in the Senate provided a reconciliation bill raises revenue or spends it. Repealing the IRA would essentially be doing the opposite.</p>
