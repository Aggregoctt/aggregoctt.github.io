<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Gemini, Google&#8217;s AI-powered chatbot, can now connect to GitHub &#8212; for users subscribed to the $20-per-month Gemini Advanced plan, that is. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As of Wednesday, Gemini Advanced customers can directly add a public or private codebase on GitHub to Gemini to allow the chatbot to generate and explain code, debug existing code, and more. Users can connect GitHub to Gemini by clicking the &#8220;+&#8221; button in the prompt bar, selecting &#8220;import code,&#8221; and pasting a GitHub URL. </p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A word of warning: AI models, including Google&#8217;s, still struggle to code quality software. Code-generating AI tends to introduce security vulnerabilities <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ai-generated-code-outages/">and</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/ai-models-still-struggle-to-debug-software-microsoft-study-shows/">errors</a>,&#160;owing to weaknesses in areas like the ability to understand programming logic.&#160;<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/23/ai_developer_devin_poor_reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">One recent evaluation of Devin</a>, a popular AI coding tool, found that it could only complete three out of 20 programming tests.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The new GitHub integration arrives <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/08/chatgpts-deep-research-tool-gets-a-github-connector-to-answer-questions-about-code/">just a few days</a> after OpenAI launched a GitHub connector for ChatGPT deep research, a tool that searches across the web and other sources to compile thorough research reports on a topic. AI companies, including Google and OpenAI, are moving quickly to ship new capabilities in an effort to make their products stand out in an increasingly crowded field. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Case in point, OpenAI on Tuesday brought SharePoint and Microsoft OneDrive connectors to ChatGPT deep research.</p>
