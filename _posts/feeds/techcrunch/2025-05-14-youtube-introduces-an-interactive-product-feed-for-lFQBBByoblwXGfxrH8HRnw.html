<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">YouTube made its pitch to advertisers on Wednesday, accompanied by a flashy performance from Lady Gaga and special appearances from popular YouTubers like Brittany Broski and MrBeast.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">During its Upfront presentation, YouTube executives introduced new ad formats coming to the platform, including an enhanced shoppable connected TV (CTV) offering that includes a new interactive product feed.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The move is strategic for YouTube, as it recognizes that viewers often watch videos on the big screen while also using their phones to scroll through social media or shop online.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The new shoppable format allows advertisers to display products on the right side of the TV screen during ads. The interactive feed acts as a storefront for brands where viewers can easily browse multiple products using their remotes. When a viewer selects an item, they&#8217;re prompted to scan a QR code with their smartphone to get a direct link for purchase.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Additionally, there&#8217;s a button for viewers to press and hold, allowing them to send the link to their phones to shop for all the products at once.&#160;</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">YouTube has become a dominant force in TV viewing. <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/news-center/2025/the-gauge-march-madness-lifts-cable-streaming-competition-grows-as-seasonal-trends-take-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nielsen</a> reported that it has been the top platform for streaming watch time in the U.S. for over two years, surpassing streaming giants Netflix, Disney+, and Prime Video. In the first quarter of 2025, TVs were the primary device for YouTube viewing in the U.S., according to internal data from the company.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Notably, the company pointed to a Kantar survey, indicating that U.S. participants ranked YouTube as the No. 1 platform for seeking out information about brands.&#160;The company also said YouTube campaigns on CTV generated over 50 million monthly average conversions in the fourth quarter.</p>
