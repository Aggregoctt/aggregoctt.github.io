<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">During the Android Show on Tuesday, leading up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/09/google-i-o-2025-what-to-expect-including-updates-to-gemini-and-android-16/">Google I/O</a>, Google announced that it&#8217;s bringing Gemini to Wear OS smartwatches and Google TV. The announcement is part of Google&#8217;s plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/google-is-replacing-google-assistant-with-gemini/">replace Google Assistant with Gemini</a> across all of its devices and platforms. Tuesday&#8217;s announcement doesn&#8217;t come as a surprise, as users have been expecting Google to bring its AI assistant to Wear OS smartwatches and Google TV.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The tech giant says this expansion will make its AI assistant accessible beyond phones to allow people to use it when they&#8217;re doing things like going on a run or relaxing on the couch.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Wear OS smartwatch users will get access to Gemini on their wrist, which Google says will be useful in situations where you can&#8217;t use your phone, like when you&#8217;re covered in flour while cooking or in the middle of a bike ride.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google notes that you can talk to Gemini naturally, which means that you don&#8217;t have to get the words exactly right.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">For example, if you&#8217;re in a locker room at your gym and you already put your phone away, you can use Gemini on your smartwatch to set reminders, like &#8220;Remember, I&#8217;m using locker 43 today.&#8221; Plus, since Gemini can connect to your apps, you can ask about the restaurant that your friend just emailed you about, without having to pause your workout or use your phone.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Gemini is coming to Wear OS smartwatches in coming months. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google says Gemini on Google TV will allow users to do things like get personalized recommendations for content, like asking for a list of action movies that are age-appropriate for kids, for example.</p>
 

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Gemini will also be able to answer questions. For example, your kids can ask the assistant about the solar system, after which Gemini could pull up the perfect educational YouTube video to help them learn more about their various interests.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Gemini will launch on Google TV later this year.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company is also integrating Gemini to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/12/google-announces-android-xr-platform-will-launch-first-on-samsungs-project-moohan-device/">Android XR</a>, its new platform for Extended Reality (XR) devices like headsets and glasses. Google announced back in December that Android XR will first launch with the Samsung-built Project Moohan headset, which will be available for purchase sometime this year. </p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It&#8217;s not surprising that Google is bringing Gemini to Android XR, as the company previously said that users will be able to control the headset with Gemini and ask questions about the app and content that they are looking at.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;When the first headset launches later this year, Gemini can help you do things like planning a vacation by surrounding you with videos, maps, and local tips, and this helps you create an entire itinerary in minutes within this very rich, immersive experience,&#8221; said Guemmy Kim, senior director of product and user experience on the Android team, in a briefing with reporters.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As part of Tuesday&#8217;s announcement, Google shared that <a href="http://googles-bringing-gemini-to-your-car-with-android-auto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gemini is coming to Android Auto</a> in the coming months. This expansion will allow users to do things like ask Gemini to find a charging station that&#8217;s, for example, on the way to the post office that&#8217;s also near a park. Plus, you can ask it to summarize the messages you receive or give you a rundown of the news.</p>
