<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Apple on Monday released iOS 18.5, which expands <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/101573" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">emergency satellite capabilities</a> to iPhone 13 owners for the first time. Previously, the satellite features were available to those running an iPhone 14 or later.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The emergency satellite system for iPhone is designed to be used at critical times when a cellular signal or Wi-Fi is not available, as it lets people contact emergency services, send a text by satellite, share information with their emergency contacts, or call for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/12/apple-launches-roadside-assistance-via-satellite/">roadside assistance</a>.  </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The iOS 18.5 update is focused on providing access to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">carriers&#8217; satellite services</a>, like those from T-Mobile (with Starlink). You can check to see if you have access to this feature from the Cellular menu under the iPhone&#8217;s Settings.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">To date, the feature has been <a href="https://www.backpacker.com/news-and-events/news/apple-iphone-satellite-sos-saving-hikers-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">credited with saving lives</a>, rescuers say, including <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/hiking-and-backpacking/apple-iphone-sos-app-continental-divide-trail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">helping lost</a> and <a href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/lives-were-100-saved-as-iphone-and-apple-watch-emergency-sos-features-get-the-first-responder-seal-of-approval" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">injured hikers</a>, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/kaslo-search-and-rescue-wildfire-1.7277770" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">saving people from wildfires</a>, and more.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While the expansion of satellite emergency services to iPhone 13 owners is the most notable addition with iOS 18.5, iPhone users are also receiving a good handful of smaller updates.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This includes the addition of a new feature for Screen Time, Apple&#8217;s parental control software, which alerts parents if their child correctly enters the parent&#8217;s passcode to access Screen Time permissions. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Among the other improvements is an updated Mail app, which makes it easier to access the &#8220;All Mail&#8221; category as its own tab; a new Pride wallpaper; and an easier way to subscribe to content from the Apple TV app on a smart TV or connected device. Plus, Apple has fixed a bug where the Apple Vision Pro app would launch with a black screen if downloaded from the App Store, as well as other bugs with Siri, enterprise apps not launching, and more. </p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">iOS 18.5 was released alongside iPadOS 18.5, which largely addresses bug fixes; visionOS 2.5; watchOS 11.5; and security-focused updates for macOS Ventura 13.7.6 (22H625) and macOS Sonoma 14.7.6.</p>
