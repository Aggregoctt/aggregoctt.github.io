<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">U.S. lawmakers introduced Wednesday the Supersonic Aviation Modernization Act in a bid to revise the FAA&#8217;s 52-year ban on supersonic flight over U.S. soil. The bipartisan legislation &#8211; introduced by Senator Ted Budd (R-NC), Aviation Subcommittee Chair Troy Nehls (R-TX), and Representative Sharice Davids (D-KS) &#8211; would allow supersonic travel, provided no audible sonic boom reaches the ground.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Dubbed the &#8220;Boom&#8221; bill, the move comes as Colorado-based Boom Supersonic makes progress in developing next-generation supersonic aircraft. Boom&#8217;s XB-1 demonstrator aircraft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/booms-xb-1-becomes-first-civil-aircraft-to-go-supersonic/">made history in January</a> when it became the first privately developed civil aircraft to break the sound barrier over the continental United States.&#160;</p>
