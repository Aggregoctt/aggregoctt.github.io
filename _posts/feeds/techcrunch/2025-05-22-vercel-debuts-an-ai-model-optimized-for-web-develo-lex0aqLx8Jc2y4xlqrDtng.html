excerpt: The team behind Vercel&#8217;s V0, an AI-powered platform for web creation,
  has developed an AI model it claims excels at certain website development tasks.
  Available through an API, the model, called &#8220;v0-1.0-md,&#8221; can be prompted
  with text or images, and was &#8220;optimized for front-end and full-stack web development,&#8221;
  the Vercel team says. Currently in beta, [&#8230;]

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">The team behind Vercel&#8217;s V0, an AI-powered platform for web creation, has <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vercel.com/docs/v0/api">developed</a> an AI model it claims excels at certain website development tasks. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Available through an API, the model, called &#8220;v0-1.0-md,&#8221; can be prompted with text or images, and was &#8220;optimized for front-end and full-stack web development,&#8221; the Vercel team says. Currently in beta, it requires a V0 Premium plan ($20 per month) or Team plan ($30 per user per month) with usage-based billing enabled.  </p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The launch of V0&#8217;s model comes as more developers and companies look to adopt AI-powered tools for programming. According to a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1401409/popular-ai-uses-in-development-workflow-globally/">Stack Overflow survey</a> last year, around 82% of developers reported that they&#8217;re using AI tools for writing code. Meanwhile, a quarter of startups in Y Combinator&#8217;s W25 batch have 95% of their codebases generated by AI, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/a-quarter-of-startups-in-ycs-current-cohort-have-codebases-that-are-almost-entirely-ai-generated/">per</a> YC managing partner Jared Friedman.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Vercel&#8217;s model can &#8220;auto-fix&#8221; common coding issues, the Vercel team says, and it&#8217;s compatible with tools and SDKs that support OpenAI&#8217;s API format. Evaluated on web development frameworks like Next.js, the model can ingest up to 128,000 tokens in one go. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Tokens are the raw bits of data that AI models work with, with a million tokens being equivalent to about 750,000 words (roughly 163,000 words longer than &#8220;War and Peace&#8221;).</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Vercel isn&#8217;t the only outfit developing tailored models for programming, it should be noted. Last month,&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/jetbrains-releases-mellum-an-open-ai-coding-model/">JetBrains</a>, the company behind a range of popular app development tools, debuted its first &#8220;open&#8221; AI coding model. Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/15/vibe-coding-startup-windsurf-launches-in-house-ai-models/">Windsurf</a> released a family of programming-focused models dubbed SWE-1. And just yesterday, Mistral unveiled a model, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/mistrals-new-devstral-model-was-designed-for-coding/">Devstral</a>, tuned for particular developer tasks.</p>
