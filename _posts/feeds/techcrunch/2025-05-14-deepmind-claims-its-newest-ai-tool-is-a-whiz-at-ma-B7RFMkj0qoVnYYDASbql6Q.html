<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Google&#8217;s AI R&amp;D lab, DeepMind says it has developed a new AI system to tackle problems with &#8220;machine-gradeable&#8221; solutions.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In experiments, the system, called AlphaEvolve, could help optimize some of the infrastructure Google uses to train its AI models, DeepMind said. The company says it&#8217;s building a user interface for interacting with AlphaEvolve, and plans to launch an early access program for selected academics ahead of a possible broader rollout.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Most AI models hallucinate. Owing to their probabilistic architectures, they confidently make things up sometimes. In fact, newer AI models like OpenAI&#8217;s o3 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/">hallucinate more than their predecessors</a>, illustrating the challenging nature of the issue.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">AlphaEvolve introduces a clever mechanism to cut down on hallucinations: an automatic evaluation system. The system uses models to generate, critique and arrive at a pool of possible answers to a question, and automatically evaluates and scores the answers for accuracy.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">AlphaEvolve isn&#8217;t the first system to take this tack. Researchers, <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/funsearch-making-new-discoveries-in-mathematical-sciences-using-large-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">including a team at DeepMind several years ago</a>, have applied similar techniques in various math domains. But DeepMind claims AlphaEvolve&#8217;s use of &#8220;state-of-the-art&#8221; models &#8212; specifically Gemini models &#8212; makes it significantly more capable than earlier instances of AI.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">To use AlphaEvolve, users must prompt the system with a problem, optionally including details like instructions, equations, code snippets and relevant literature. They must also provide a mechanism for automatically assessing the system&#8217;s answers in the form of a formula.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Because AlphaEvolve can only solve problems that it can self-evaluate, the system can only work with certain types of problems &#8212; specifically those in fields like computer science and system optimization. In another major limitation, AlphaEvolve can only describe solutions as algorithms, making it a poor fit for problems that aren&#8217;t numerical.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">To benchmark AlphaEvolve, DeepMind had the system attempt a curated set of around 50 math problems spanning branches from geometry to combinatorics. AlphaEvolve managed to &#8220;rediscover&#8221; the best-known answers to the problems 75% of the time and uncover improved solutions in 20% of cases, claims DeepMind.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">DeepMind also evaluated AlphaEvolve on practical problems, like boosting the efficiency of Google&#8217;s data centers, and speeding up model training runs. According to the lab, AlphaEvolve generated an algorithm that continuously recovers 0.7% of Google&#8217;s worldwide compute resources on average. The system also suggested an optimization that reduced the overall time it takes Google to train its Gemini models by 1%.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">To be clear, AlphaEvolve isn&#8217;t making breakthrough discoveries. In one experiment, the system was able to find an improvement for Google&#8217;s TPU AI accelerator chip design that had been flagged by other tools earlier.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">DeepMind, however, is making the same case that many AI labs do for their systems: that AlphaEvolve can save time while freeing up experts to focus on other, more important work.</p>
