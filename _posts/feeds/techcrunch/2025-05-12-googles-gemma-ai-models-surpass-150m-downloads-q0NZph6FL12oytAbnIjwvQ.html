<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Google&#8217;s openly available Gemma collection of AI models has reached a milestone: over 150 million downloads. Omar Sanseviero, a developer relations engineer at Google DeepMind, <a href="https://x.com/osanseviero/status/1921636582873800746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1921636582873800746%7Ctwgr%5E6a1c3400a4c37d2c76f58f9004e7e1709500e107%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D3005797action%3Dedit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the figure on X over the weekend, also revealing that developers have created more than 70,000 variants of Gemma on the AI dev platform Hugging Face.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google launched Gemma in February 2024, aiming to compete with other &#8220;open&#8221; model families like Meta&#8217;s Llama. The latest Gemma releases are multimodal, meaning that they can work with images as well as text, and support over 100 languages. Google has also created versions of Gemma fine-tuned for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/05/google-says-its-new-open-models-can-identify-emotions-and-that-has-experts-worried/">particular applications</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/14/googles-newest-ai-model-is-designed-to-help-study-dolphin-speech/">like</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/google-plans-to-release-new-open-ai-models-for-drug-discovery/">drug discovery</a>.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While 140 million downloads in roughly a year is a head-turning metric, Gemma trails far behind Llama, perhaps its chief rival, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/meta-says-its-llama-ai-models-have-been-downloaded-1-2b-times/">surpassed 1.2 billion downloads</a> in late April. </p>
