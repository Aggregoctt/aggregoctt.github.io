<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">As generative AI becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing, the ethical stakes are no longer theoretical. What happens when the tools to deceive become widely accessible? And how do we build systems that are powerful &#8212; but safe enough to trust?</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-ai/?utm_source=tc&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=tcsessionsai2025&amp;utm_content=speaker&amp;promo=post_atemision_05232025&amp;display=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>TechCrunch Sessions: AI</strong></a>, taking place <strong>June 5 at UC Berkeley&#8217;s Zellerbach Hall</strong>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/artemis-seaford-9ab27322/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Artemis Seaford</a>, Head of AI Safety at ElevenLabs, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ionstoica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ion Stoica</a>, co-founder of Databricks and professor at UC Berkeley, will take the main stage to unpack the ethical challenges of today&#8217;s AI. Their conversation will cut to the heart of one of the most urgent questions in tech: What are we unleashing &#8212; and can we still steer it?</p>

 

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-seaford-and-stoica-are-tackling-ai-s-toughest-ethical-questions">How Seaford and Stoica are tackling AI&#8217;s toughest ethical questions</h2>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Artemis brings a rare blend of academic depth and frontline experience. At <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ElevenLabs</a>, she leads AI safety efforts focused on media authenticity and abuse prevention. Her background spans OpenAI, Meta, and global risk management at the intersection of law, policy, and geopolitics. Expect a grounded, clear-eyed take on how deepfakes are evolving, what new risks are emerging, and which interventions are actually working.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Ion, meanwhile, brings a systems-level view. He&#8217;s not just a leader in AI research&#8212;he&#8217;s helped build the infrastructure behind it. From Spark to Ray to ChatBot Arena, his open source projects power many of today&#8217;s most advanced AI deployments. As executive chairman of <a href="https://www.databricks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Databricks</a> and a founder of several AI-driven companies, Ion knows what it takes to scale responsibly &#8212; and where today&#8217;s tools still fall short.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Together, they&#8217;ll unpack the ethical blind spots in today&#8217;s development cycles, explore how safety can be embedded into core architectures, and examine the roles that industry, academia, and regulation must play in the years ahead.</p>
