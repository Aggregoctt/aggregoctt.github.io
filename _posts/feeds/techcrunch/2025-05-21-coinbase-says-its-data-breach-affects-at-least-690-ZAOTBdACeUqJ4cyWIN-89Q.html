<div>
<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Coinbase said at least 69,461 customers had personal and financial information stolen during a months-long data breach that it disclosed last week.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The crypto giant confirmed the number of affected customers <a href="https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/f61fae18-f669-499e-9a87-f4d323d281f8.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a filing with Maine&#8217;s attorney general</a> on Wednesday, as required by the state&#8217;s data breach notification law.&#160;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Coinbase&#8217;s filing said the breach dates back to December 26, 2024, and continued until <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001679788/000167978825000094/coin-20250514.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earlier this month</a>, when the company said it received a &#8220;credible&#8221; ransom note from the hacker claiming it had stolen customer data.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/protecting-our-customers-standing-up-to-extortionists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a>, Coinbase said the hacker demanded $20 million in a ransom payment to delete the data, which Coinbase refused to pay. The company said the hacker bribed Coinbase customer support workers into accessing customers&#8217; data over a period of several months.&#160;</p>
