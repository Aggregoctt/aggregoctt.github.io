<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Google announced at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/storyline/google-i-o-2025-live-coverage-gemini-android-16-updates-and-more/">Google I/O 2025</a> that it is making the AI model that powers its experimental music production app, MusicFX DJ, available via an API.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The model, Lyria RealTime, is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.slack.com/archives/C08NWK899A7/p1747682603216619">now</a> in Google&#8217;s Gemini API and AI Studio platform. It can mix musical genres, change instruments, and alter the mood of AI-generated music, giving users control over the key, tempo, brightness, and other song characteristics and elements.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The launch of Lyria RealTime via API comes amidst an explosion of AI-powered music apps. There&#8217;s Udio and Suno, as well as the recently debuted Riffusion &#8212; among many others.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Many of these have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/01/ai-music-startup-suno-response-riaa-lawsuit/">proven to be</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/01/ai-music-startup-suno-response-riaa-lawsuit/">controversial</a>, particularly those driven by models trained on copyrighted music without permission. But Google pitches Lyria RealTime as a collaborative tool &#8212; one that can be used to interactively create, control, and even perform high-quality (48kHz stereo) songs.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google didn&#8217;t announce pricing for Lyria RealTime ahead of its API rollout.</p>
