title: Laser-powered fusion experiment more than doubles its power output

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">The world&#8217;s only net-positive fusion experiment has been steadily ramping up the amount of power it produces, TechCrunch has learned.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In recent attempts, the team at the U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s National Ignition Facility (NIF) increased the yield of the experiment, first to 5.2 megajoules and then again to 8.6 megajoules, according to a source with knowledge of the experiment.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The new results are significant improvements over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/world-record-fusion-experiment-produced-even-more-energy-than-expected/">the historic experiment in 2022</a>, which was the first controlled fusion reaction to generate more energy than the it consumed.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The 2022 shot generated 3.15 megajoules, a small bump over the 2.05 megajoules that the lasers delivered to the BB-sized fuel pellet.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">None of the shots to date have been effective enough to feed electrons back into the grid, let alone to offset the energy required to power the entire facility &#8212; the facility wasn&#8217;t designed to do that. The first net-positive shot, for example, required 300 megajoules to power the laser system alone. But they are continued proof that controlled nuclear fusion is more than hypothetical.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The NIF uses what&#8217;s known as inertial confinement to produce fusion reactions. At the facility, fusion fuel is coated in diamond and then encased in a small gold cylinder called a hohlraum. That tiny pellet is dropped into a spherical vacuum chamber 10 meters in diameter, where 192 powerful laser beams converge on the target.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The cylinder is vaporized under the onslaught, emitting X-rays in the process that bombard the fuel pellet inside. The pellet&#8217;s diamond coating receives so much energy that it turns into an expanding plasma, which compresses the deuterium-tritium fuel inside to the point where their nuclei fuse, releasing energy in the process.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The other main approach to fusion, magnetic confinement, uses powerful superconducting magnets to compress and contain plasma in a space tight enough to create the conditions necessary for fusion. While no magnetic confinement experiments have produced net-positive results, several are being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/bill-gates-backed-commonwealth-fusion-systems-hits-key-reactor-construction-milestone/">constructed</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/realta-fusion-taps-36m-in-fresh-funds-for-its-fusion-in-a-bottle-reactor/">designed</a> with the expectation that they&#8217;ll hit that milestone.</p>
