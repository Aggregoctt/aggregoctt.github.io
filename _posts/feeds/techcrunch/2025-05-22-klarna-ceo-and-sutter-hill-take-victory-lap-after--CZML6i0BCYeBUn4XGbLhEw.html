<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Hours after Sam Altman and Jony Ive announced on Wednesday that OpenAI was buying Ive&#8217;s company, io, in an all-stock transaction valued at $6.5 billion, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski posted a <a href="https://x.com/klarnaseb/status/1925457954582450389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">surprising message on X</a>.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Siemiatkowski&#8217;s family investment office, Flat Capital, had bought <a href="https://www.flatcapital.com/en/press-releases/detail/?slug=flat-confirms-its-previous-investment-of-34-msek-in-io-products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shares in io six months earlier</a>, he said. Since this is an all-stock deal, those io shares will be converted into shares in the for-profit arm of OpenAI.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Excited that<a href="https://x.com/FlatCapital" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> @FlatCapital</a> was an investor in io and that we will now receive even more shares in OpenAI at a hefty return for an investment we did some 6 months ago,&#8221; Siemiatkowski tweeted.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The post generated so much interest that his investment firm <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.flatcapital.com/en/press-releases/detail/?slug=flat-confirms-its-previous-investment-of-34-msek-in-io-products">issued a public statement</a> confirming that io was the mystery, unnamed company it backed <a href="https://www.flatcapital.com/en/press-releases/detail/?slug=flat-invests-49-msek-in-a-mini-portfolio-consisting-of-four-us-based-ai-companies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">when it announced</a> its four investments in a &#8220;mini-portfolio&#8221; of U.S. AI companies. Flat Capital disclosed that it spent 34 million SEK on io, which converts to about $3.6 million.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Then came another surprising tweet from former Googler and designer Luke Wroblewski, who now works as a managing director at the secretive Silicon Valley VC powerhouse firm Sutter Hill Ventures.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In a since-deleted tweet and LinkedIn post, Wroblewski wrote, &#8220;congrats to io on the $6.5B acquisition by OpenAI today. happy to have been investors in this one.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">According to <a href="https://x.com/jacksondahl/status/1925251433483354361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">some who saw</a> additional now-deleted tweets about Sutter&#8217;s investment, the firm may have been the second largest investor in io. TechCrunch couldn&#8217;t confirm that, though. Sutter didn&#8217;t respond to our request for comment, and Wroblewski deleted his posts after we reached out.&#160;</p>
