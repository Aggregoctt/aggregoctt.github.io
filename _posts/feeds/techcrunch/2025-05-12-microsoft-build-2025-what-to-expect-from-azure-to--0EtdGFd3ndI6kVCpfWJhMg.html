<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Microsoft is hosting its annual Build developer conference next week from May 19 to 22. The event is guaranteed to include announcements regarding new AI integrations, services, and apps, including for Windows.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At last year&#8217;s Build, Microsoft announced an integration of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/microsoft-intros-a-copilot-for-teams/">Copilot into Microsoft Teams</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/microsoft-build-2024-windows-ai-operating-system-copilot-plus-pcs/">Copilot+ AI-powered PCs</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/microsofts-new-volumetric-apps-for-quest-headsets-extend-windows-apps-into-the-3d-space/">Windows Volumetric Apps</a> for Meta Quest headsets, and more.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/09/microsoft-build-2025-how-to-watch-this-years-conference/">keynotes will be streamed online</a> for free. As for what to expect, there is good reason to believe Microsoft will announce deeper integrations for its Copilot generative AI with many of its software offerings, both on the consumer and enterprise sides.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company last November <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/software/microsoft-announces-365-and-copilot-price-hike-heres-how-much-more-youll-pay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">raised prices for many of its software products</a>, including Windows 365, Office 365, and Microsoft 365, among many others, by 5%. To justify these increases, the company could introduce new AI-powered features and capabilities.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Copilot is likely to be a headliner at Build, and big changes to it could be on the way. Microsoft is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/microsoft-reportedly-ramps-up-ai-efforts-to-compete-with-openai/">reportedly testing alternative AI models</a> from xAI, Meta, Anthropic, and DeepSeek as possible replacements for OpenAI technology in Copilot as the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/11/microsoft-and-openai-may-be-renegotiating-their-partnership/">becomes strained</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">On Windows, Copilot could gain &#8220;agentic&#8221; functionality that allows the tech to perform basic PC tasks autonomously. Well-known leaker TestingCatalog <a href="https://www.testingcatalog.com/microsoft-copilot-starts-testing-agent-actions-and-adds-native-image-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found references</a> to an Action button in the Copilot client for Windows that, when selected, can kick off certain &#8220;everyday tasks.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Microsoft is also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-07/microsoft-creates-in-house-ai-models-it-believes-rival-openai-s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said to have developed a family of models</a> called MAI that are competitive with OpenAI&#8217;s own,&#160;which the tech giant is considering offering through an API. Build may well end up being the venue where Microsoft decides to unveil these.</p>
