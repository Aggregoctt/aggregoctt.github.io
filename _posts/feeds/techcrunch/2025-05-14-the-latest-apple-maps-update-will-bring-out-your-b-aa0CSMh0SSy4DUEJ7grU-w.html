<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Apple Maps <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/apple-brings-insights-ratings-and-reviews-from-expert-sources-to-apple-maps/">announced</a> a collaboration with the MICHELIN Guide, The Infatuation, and Golf Digest to help users find recommended restaurants and golf courses in their area.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Starting in the U.S., users will be able to filter their Maps searches to see restaurants with MICHELIN ratings, which denote exceptional dining experiences. But if you&#8217;re on the go, you&#8217;re probably not making a last-minute MICHELIN booking &#8212; but options from The Infatuation, a restaurant recommendation website, can help fill in the gaps.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Though the MICHELIN Guide is most well-known for its dining expertise, it also offers hotel recommendations and booking services, which will also be available on Apple Maps.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Golf Digest integration on Maps will function similarly, allowing users to filter their searches to find recommended golf courses &#8212; but we imagine that more users will be looking for places to eat, rather than to tee off.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">These partners will also contribute to Apple Maps&#8217; curated guides, which can help travelers find their way to top destinations on a visit. </p>
