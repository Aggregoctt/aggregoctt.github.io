<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Nine years ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton sent shock waves through medicine by declaring it &#8220;just completely obvious&#8221; that AI would make radiologists extinct in short order. Fast-forward and the specialists &#8212; who do more than analyze images &#8212; are thriving, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/technology/ai-jobs-radiologists-mayo-clinic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">observes The New York Times</a>. In fact, the field is experiencing explosive growth amid a looming workforce crisis. (According to projections from the Association of American Medical Colleges, the U.S. will face a staggering shortage of up to 42,000 radiologists and other physician specialists by 2033.)</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Rather than stealing jobs, notes the piece, AI has become radiologists&#8217; secret weapon, allowing them to instantly measure organs, automatically flag abnormalities, and even detect diseases years before conventional methods. At the Mayo Clinic, where radiologist numbers have skyrocketed by 55% since Hinton&#8217;s prediction, the radiology department has grown to include a 40-person team of AI scientists, researchers, analysts, and engineers who have licensed and developed more than 250 AI models, ranging from tissue analyzers to disease predictors.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Five years from now, it will be malpractice not to use AI,&#8221; says John Halamka, president of the Mayo Clinic Platform, who oversees the health system&#8217;s digital initiatives, in the article.</p>
