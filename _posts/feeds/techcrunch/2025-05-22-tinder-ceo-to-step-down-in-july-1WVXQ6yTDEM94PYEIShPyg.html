<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Iosotaluno served less than a year in the role and spent nearly eight years overall at the company, which is owned by Match Group. In her post, she said she was &#8220;especially proud to build and work alongside an exceptional team.&#8221; She said what is next for her is &#8220;deeply personal.&#8221;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;The consumer tech landscape is evolving in exciting, unpredictable ways &#8212; and so are my own ambitions,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;Building upon the headway and lessons I&#8217;ve learned at Tinder where diverse voices around the table make better and more impactful decisions, I&#8217;m drawn to replicating that progress by supporting and building alongside the next generation of women leaders, founders, and investors.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Meanwhile, in a separate post, Match Group CEO Spencer Rascoff <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7331368487686197248/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said he would step</a> in to lead the Tinder team.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful for the time we&#8217;ve spent together over the past few months preparing for this news to ensure a smooth transition,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;As I step in to lead the team, I&#8217;m energized by the momentum you&#8217;ve helped create and excited to continue building with the exceptional leaders in place.&#8221; </p>
