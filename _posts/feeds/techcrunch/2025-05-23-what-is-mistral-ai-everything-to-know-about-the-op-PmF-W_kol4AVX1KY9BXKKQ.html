title: What is Mistral AI? Everything to know about the OpenAI competitor
---
<div>
<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Mistral AI, the French company behind AI assistant Le Chat and several foundational models, is officially regarded as one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/23/the-biggest-french-startups-in-2024-according-to-the-french-government/">France&#8217;s most promising tech startups</a> and is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/macron-unveils-a-112b-ai-investment-package-as-frances-answer-to-stargate/">arguably the only European company that could compete with OpenAI</a>. But compared to its $6 billion valuation, its global market share is still relatively low.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">However, the recent launch of its chat assistant on mobile app stores was met with some hype, particularly in its home country. &#8220;Go and download Le Chat, which is made by Mistral, rather than ChatGPT by OpenAI &#8212; or something else,&#8221; French president Emmanuel Macron said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/19/mistrals-le-chat-tops-1m-downloads-in-just-14-days/">in a TV interview</a> ahead of the AI Action Summit in Paris.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While this wave of attention may be encouraging, Mistral AI still faces challenges in competing with the likes of OpenAI &#8212; and in doing so while keeping up with its self-definition as &#8220;the world&#8217;s greenest and leading independent AI lab.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-mistral-ai"><strong>What is Mistral AI?</strong></h2>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Mistral AI has raised significant amounts of funding since its creation in 2023 with the ambition to &#8220;put frontier AI in the hands of everyone.&#8221; While this isn&#8217;t a direct jab at OpenAI, the slogan is meant to highlight the company&#8217;s advocacy for openness in AI.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Its alternative to ChatGPT, chat assistant Le Chat, is now also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/mistral-releases-its-ai-assistant-on-ios-and-android/">available on iOS and Android</a>. It reached <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/19/mistrals-le-chat-tops-1m-downloads-in-just-14-days/">1 million downloads</a> in the two weeks following its mobile release, even grabbing France&#8217;s top spot for free downloads on the iOS App Store.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This comes in addition to Mistral AI&#8217;s suite of models, which includes:&#160;</p>

</ul>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In March 2025, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/mistrals-new-ocr-api-turns-any-pdf-document-into-an-ai-ready-markdown-file/">introduced Mistral OCR</a>, an optical character recognition (OCR) API that can turn any PDF into a text file to make it easier for AI models to ingest.</p>
 

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-are-mistral-ai-s-founders"><strong>Who are Mistral AI&#8217;s founders?</strong></h2>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Mistral AI&#8217;s three founders&#160;share a background in AI research at major U.S. tech companies with significant operations in Paris. CEO Arthur Mensch used to work at Google&#8217;s DeepMind, while CTO Timoth&#233;e Lacroix and chief scientist officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta staffers.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Co-founding advisers also include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/alans-founder-role-in-mistrals-origin-story/">Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve</a> (also a board member) and Charles Gorintin from health insurance startup Alan, as well as former digital minister C&#233;dric O, which <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/french-tech-pantouflage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">caused controversy</a> due to his previous role.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-mistral-ai-s-models-open-source"><strong>Are Mistral AI&#8217;s models open source?</strong></h2>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models/models_overview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Not all of them</a>. Mistral AI differentiates its premier models, whose <a href="https://duohub.ai/glossary/w/weights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">weights</a> are not available for commercial purposes, from its free models, for which it provides weight access under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Free models include research models such as Mistral NeMo, which was built in collaboration with Nvidia that the startup <a href="https://mistral.ai/en/news/mistral-nemo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">open sourced</a> in July 2024.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-does-mistral-ai-make-money"><strong>How does Mistral AI make money?</strong></h2>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While many of Mistral AI&#8217;s offerings are free or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/17/mistral-launches-a-free-tier-for-developers-to-test-its-ai-models/">now have free tiers</a>, Mistral AI plans to drive some revenue from Le Chat&#8217;s paid tiers. Introduced in February 2025, Le Chat&#8217;s Pro plan is priced at $14.99 a month.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">On the purely B2B side, Mistral AI monetizes its premier models through APIs with usage-based pricing. Enterprises can also license these models, and the company likely also generates a significant share of its revenue from its strategic partnerships, some of which it highlighted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/mistral-gets-down-to-business/">during the Paris AI Summit</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Overall, however, Mistral AI&#8217;s revenue is reportedly still in the eight-digit range, according to multiple sources.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-partnerships-has-mistral-ai-closed"><strong>What partnerships has Mistral AI closed?</strong></h2>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In 2024, Mistral AI entered a deal with Microsoft that included a strategic partnership for distributing its AI models through Microsoft&#8217;s Azure platform and a &#8364;15 million investment. The U.K.&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/17/microsoft-dodges-uk-antitrust-scrutiny-over-its-mistral-ai-stake/">swiftly concluded</a> that the deal didn&#8217;t qualify for investigation due to its small size. However, it also sparked some <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/02/27/furious-critics-question-microsofts-deal-with-mistral-ai-as-eu-set-to-look-into-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">criticism</a> in the EU.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In January 2025, Mistral AI <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/16/mistral-signs-deal-with-afp-to-offer-up-to-date-answers-in-le-chat/">signed a deal with press agency Agence France-Presse</a> (AFP) to let Chat query the AFP&#8217;s entire text archive dating back to 1983.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Mistral AI also secured strategic partnerships with France&#8217;s <a href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/1887772-mistral-ai-devient-un-nouvel-atout-technologique-pour-larmee-francaise.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">army</a> and <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/02/05/frances-ai-darling-mistral-and-government-jobseeker-agency-join-forces-for-ai-tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">job agency</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cmacgm-group.com/en/news-media/cma-cgm-group-adopts-custom-designed-ai-solutions-mistral-ai">shipping giant CMA</a>, German defense tech startup <a href="https://helsing.ai/newsroom/helsing-and-mistral-announce-strategic-partnership-in-defence-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Helsing</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/new/announcements/ibm-launches-mistral-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IBM</a>, <a href="https://newsroom.orange.com/orange-and-mistral-ai-join-forces-to-accelerate-artificial-intelligence-development-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Orange</a>, and <a href="https://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2025/february/stellantis-and-mistral-ai-strengthen-strategic-partnership-to-enhance-customer-experience-vehicle-development-and-manufacturing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stellantis</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In May 2025, Mistral AI announced it would participate in the creation of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mistralai_proud-to-announce-the-creation-of-europe-activity-7330199133997133825-YVhW/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an AI Campus in the Paris region</a>, as part of a joint venture with UAE-investment firm MGX, NVIDIA, and France&#8217;s state-owned investment bank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/bpifrance-to-invest-10b-in-french-ai-ecosystem-by-2029/">Bpifrance</a>.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As of February 2025, Mistral AI raised around &#8364;1 billion in capital to date, approximately $1.04 billion at the current exchange rate. This includes some debt financing, as well as several equity financing rounds raised in close succession.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In June 2023, and before it even released its first models, Mistral AI raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/13/frances-mistral-ai-blows-in-with-a-113m-seed-round-at-a-260m-valuation-to-take-on-openai/">record $112 million seed round</a> led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Sources at the time said the seed round &#8212; <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cf939ea4-d96c-4908-896a-48a74381f251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Europe&#8217;s largest ever</a> &#8212; valued the then-one-month-old startup at $260 million.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Other investors in this seed round included Bpifrance, Eric Schmidt, Exor Ventures, First Minute Capital, Headline, JCDecaux Holding, La Famiglia, LocalGlobe, Motier Ventures, Rodolphe Saad&#233;, Sofina, and Xavier Niel.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Only six months later, it closed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/11/mistral-ai-a-paris-based-openai-rival-closed-its-415-million-funding-round/">a Series A of &#8364;385 million</a> ($415 million at the time), at a reported valuation of $2 billion. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with participation from existing backer Lightspeed, as well as BNP Paribas, CMA-CGM, Conviction, Elad Gil, General Catalyst, and Salesforce.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/microsoft-made-a-16-million-investment-in-mistral-ai/">$16.3 million convertible investment</a> that Microsoft made in Mistral AI as part of their partnership announced in February 2024 was presented as a Series A extension, implying an unchanged valuation.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In June 2024, Mistral AI then raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/11/paris-based-ai-startup-mistral-ai-raises-640-million/">&#8364;600 million in a mix of equity and debt</a> (around $640 million at the exchange rate at the time). The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/09/sources-mistral-ai-raising-at-a-6b-valuation-softbank-not-in-but-dst-is/">long-rumored round</a> was led by General Catalyst at a $6 billion valuation, with notable investors, including Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation, and others.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-could-a-mistral-ai-exit-look-like"><strong>What could a Mistral AI exit look like?</strong></h2>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/mistral-ai-plans-ipo/">Mistral is &#8220;not for sale,&#8221;</a> Mensch said in January 2025 at the World Economic Forum in Davos. &#8220;Of course, [an IPO is] the plan.&#8221;&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This makes sense, given how much the startup has raised so far: Even a large sale may not provide high enough multiples for its investors, not to mention sovereignty concerns depending on the acquirer.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">However, the only way to definitely squash persistent acquisition rumors is to scale its revenue to levels that could even remotely justify its nearly $6 billion valuation. Either way, stay tuned.</p>
