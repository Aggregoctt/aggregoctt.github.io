<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Veteran Chipotle executive Jack Hartung was appointed a member of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors Thursday, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000162828025026148/tsla-20250515.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tesla filing with the SEC</a>. Hartung&#8217;s addition to the board comes as Tesla quietly works to finish its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/653959/tesla-1950s-diner-drive-in-near-complete-los-angeles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">1950s-style diner and charging station</a> in Los Angeles.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Hartung brings over two decades of experience as a Chipotle CFO, president, and chief strategy officer to Tesla&#8217;s board. He has overseen all finance and accounting at Chipotle, as well as supply chain, strategy, and safety and asset protection as the company has grown to over 3,700 restaurants today across the U.S. and globally.&#160;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Prior to Chipotle, Hartung spent almost 20 years at McDonald&#8217;s, where he served as VP and CFO of the restaurant chain&#8217;s partner brands group.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While Hartung&#8217;s business and financial acumen are likely transferable across industries, his debut on Tesla&#8217;s board comes as the company gears up to launch the above-mentioned <a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/news/2689/inside-teslas-retro-futuristic-hollywood-diner-an-exclusive-first-look?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">retro-futuristic diner</a> and charging station in LA. Last August, Tesla advertised a role for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/13/tesla-posts-job-listing-for-1950s-style-diner-elon-musk-has-proposed-building/">Tesla Diner Experience Specialist</a> to work with the charging team to build out great customer service at the up-and-coming diner.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">TechCrunch has reached out to Tesla and Hartung to learn if the Chipotle executive will offer strategic insight and a network of contacts in the food and beverage industry.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Tesla&#8217;s regulatory filing announcing Hartung&#8217;s appointment also discloses a related-party transaction; his son-in-law has worked as a Tesla service technician since December 2016, and last year took home a $124,000 salary. Tesla says this salary is in line with the company&#8217;s standard compensation practices.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Hartung will begin his duties on the board, including on the audit committee, effective June 1. He has waived his ability to collect cash compensation, as well as his equity compensation, as the other board members have done.</p>
