<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Meeting transcription space is a hot commodity for all productivity suites.

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The latest entrant in the race to build meeting transcription tools is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.notion.com/">Notion</a>.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company is rolling out an AI-powered meeting notetaking feature to transcribe meetings and provide a summary of the talk points later. You can also take your notes while Notion&#8217;s AI is transcribing the meeting. A functionality that closely resembles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/vcs-love-using-the-ai-meeting-notepad-granola-so-they-gave-it-20m/">Granola</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The feature represents another step towards Notion becoming a broader productivity suite that could compete with tech giants like Google and Microsoft. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Like many other transcribers, Notion&#8217;s tool uses system audio to take notes. According to the support page, the AI note taker is currently available on the Mac (with app version 4.7.0). During our testing, we could only use the feature on the desktop, but Notion said it will be available on its mobile app, as well.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">To get started with the AI note-taking feature, you&#8217;ll go to any page on Notion and type &#8220;/meet.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The dialog box encourages you to obtain consent from all participants before allowing the AI tool to transcribe the meeting. Once you&#8217;ve done that, you can tap on the &#8220;Confirm Consent&#8221; button to start the transcription.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">When you click &#8220;stop,&#8221; the notetaking tool will generate an AI summary. You can click on the three-dot menu and select a formatting option, like Auto, Sales Call, Standup, or Team Meeting.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The support page suggests that the feature currently works for over a dozen languages, including English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Thai, Vietnamese, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Dutch, and Swedish.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company is also chasing enterprise customers with other new features launched today, like enterprise search, which allows you to search across Notion and other apps, and research mode, which allows users to research on a topic to create shareable documents through reasoning AI models. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company says you&#8217;ll be able to use Notion AI easily to ask questions across your meetings and documents, share the document with others, or paste the meeting block in another work folder.</p>
