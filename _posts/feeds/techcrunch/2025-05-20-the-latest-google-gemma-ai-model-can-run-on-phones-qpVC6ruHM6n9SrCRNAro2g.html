<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Google&#8217;s family of &#8220;open&#8221; AI models, Gemma, is growing. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">During <a rel="nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.slack.com/archives/C08NWK899A7/p1747682603216619">Google I/O 2025</a> on Tuesday, Google took the wraps off Gemma 3n, a model designed to run &#8220;smoothly&#8221; on phones, laptops, and tablets.

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Models efficient enough to run offline and without the need for computing in the cloud have gained steam in the AI community in recent years. Not only are they cheaper to use than large models, but they preserve privacy by eliminating the need to transfer data to a remote data center. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In addition to Gemma 3n, Google is releasing MedGemma through its Health AI Developer Foundations program. According to the company, MedGemma is its most capable open model for analyzing health-related text and images. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Also on the horizon is SignGemma, an open model to translate sign language into spoken-language text. Google says that SignGemma will enable developers to create new apps and integrations for deaf and hard-of-hearing users.</p>
