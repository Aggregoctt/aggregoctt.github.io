<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">OpenAI pushed generative AI into the public consciousness. Now, it could be developing a very different kind of AI device.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">According to a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/what-sam-altman-told-openai-about-the-secret-device-hes-making-with-jony-ive-f1384005?mod=tech_lead_story">WSJ report</a>, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told employees Wednesday that the company&#8217;s next major product won&#8217;t be a wearable. Instead, it will be a compact, screenless device, fully aware of its user&#8217;s surroundings. Small enough to sit on a desk or fit in a pocket, Altman described it as both a &#8220;third core device&#8221; alongside a MacBook Pro and iPhone, and an &#8220;AI companion&#8221; integrated into daily life.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The preview followed OpenAI&#8217;s announcement that it will acquire io, a startup founded just last year by former Apple designer Jony Ive, in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/jony-ive-to-lead-openais-design-work-following-6-5b-acquisition-of-his-company/">$6.5 billion equity deal</a>. Ive will take on a key creative and design role at OpenAI.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Altman reportedly told employees the acquisition could eventually add $1 trillion in market value to the company as it creates a new category of devices unlike the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.rabbit.tech/rabbit-r1">handhelds</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/humanes-ai-pin-is-dead-as-hp-buys-startups-assets-for-116m/">wearables</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/10/the-near-joy-of-biking-with-ray-ban-meta-glasses/">glasses</a> that other outfits have rolled out. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Altman also reportedly emphasized to staff that secrecy will be critical to prevent competitors from copying the product before launch. A recording of his remarks leaked to the Journal raises questions about how much he can trust his own team and how much more he&#8217;ll be willing to disclose.</p>
