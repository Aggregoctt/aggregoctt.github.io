<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At the company&#8217;s Build 2025 conference on Monday, Microsoft announced Microsoft Discovery, a platform that taps agentic AI to &#8220;transform the [scientific] discovery process,&#8221; according to a press release provided to TechCrunch. Microsoft Discovery is &#8220;extensible,&#8221; Microsoft says, and can handle certain science-related workloads &#8220;end-to-end.&#8221; </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Microsoft Discovery is an enterprise agentic platform that helps accelerate research and discovery by transforming the entire discovery process with agentic AI &#8212; from scientific knowledge reasoning to hypothesis formulation, candidate generation, and simulation and analysis,&#8221; explains Microsoft in its release. &#8220;The platform enables scientists and researchers to collaborate with a team of specialized AI agents to help drive scientific outcomes with speed, scale, and accuracy using the latest innovations in AI and supercomputing.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Microsoft is one among many AI labs bullish on AI for science. Earlier this year, Google unveiled an &#8220;<a href="https://research.google/blog/accelerating-scientific-breakthroughs-with-an-ai-co-scientist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AI co-scientist</a>,&#8221; which the tech giant said could help scientists with creating hypotheses and research plans. Anthropic and its chief rival, OpenAI, along with outfits like&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/01/futurehouse-releases-ai-tools-it-claims-can-accelerate-science/">FutureHouse</a>&#160;and Lila Sciences, have&#160;<a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/three-observations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">asserted</a>&#160;that AI tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery, particularly in&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/11/anthropic-ceo-goes-full-techno-optimist-in-15000-word-paean-to-ai/">medicine</a>.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But many researchers don&#8217;t consider AI today to be especially useful in&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/experts-dont-think-ai-is-ready-to-be-a-co-scientist/">guiding the scientific process</a>, largely due to its&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/">unreliability</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Part of the challenge in developing an &#8220;AI scientist&#8221; is anticipating an untold number of confounding factors. AI might come in handy in areas where broad&#160;exploration is needed, like narrowing down a vast list of possibilities, but it&#8217;s less&#160;clear whether it can do the kind of out-of-the-box problem-solving that leads to bona fide breakthroughs.<br><br>Results from AI systems designed for science have so far been mostly underwhelming. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In 2023, Google said around 40 new materials had been&#160;<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2404929-crystal-hunting-deepmind-ai-could-help-discover-new-wonder-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">synthesized</a>&#160;with the help of one of its AIs, called GNoME. But&#160;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXEnergy.3.011002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an outside analysis</a>&#160;found not even one of those materials was, in fact, new. Meanwhile, several firms employing AI for drug discovery, including Exscientia and&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/benevolentai/">BenevolentAI</a>, have suffered&#160;<a href="https://endpts.com/first-ai-designed-drugs-fall-short-in-the-clinic-following-years-of-hype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">high-profile</a>&#160;<a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/benevolentai-cruel-rd-ai-enabled-drug-flunks-midphase-eczema-trial-dent-deal-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">clinical trial failures</a>.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Microsoft no doubt hopes that its effort will fare better than those that&#8217;ve come before it.</p>
