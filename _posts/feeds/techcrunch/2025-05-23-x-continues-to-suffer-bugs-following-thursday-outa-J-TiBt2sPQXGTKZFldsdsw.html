<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">For over 24 hours, many X users, including this reporter, have been experiencing issues with the site&#8217;s basic functionality. Some messages won&#8217;t load, timelines won&#8217;t update, and certain posts can&#8217;t be seen without a webpage refresh (or several).</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The trouble started Thursday afternoon, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://downdetector.com/status/twitter/">according to Downdetector</a>, a crowdsourced platform for flagging web outages. Beginning at 2:12 p.m. Eastern, thousands of users submitted reports about bugs ranging from an inability to sign in to disappearing direct messages. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">X&#8217;s official Engineering account <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/XEng/status/1925648157062394122">acknowledged</a> the degraded service in a post on Thursday, claiming it was related to a data center outage.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;X is aware some of our users are experiencing performance issues on the platform today,&#8221; wrote the account. &#8220;We are experiencing a data center outage and the team is actively working to remediate the issue.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Wired <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-x-datacenter-fire/">reported</a> that a fire broke out Thursday at an X-leased data center near Portland, Oregon. It&#8217;s unclear if it&#8217;s related to the ongoing outages.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/x-is-experiencing-outages-on-monday-morning/">last major service disruption X</a>&#160;suffered was in March, when users worldwide were abruptly disconnected from the social network and subsequently had trouble accessing their feeds, sending messages, and engaging with content. Musk, without evidence,&#160;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/social-media-platform-x-down-thousands-users-downdetector-shows-2025-03-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blamed the disruption on a cyberattack</a>. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Prior to that outage, X experienced large-scale connectivity issues in&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/20/x-twitter-down-for-users-outage/">December 2022</a>&#160;and July 2023. More recently, in May, X timelines <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/09/x-timelines-arent-updating-for-many-users/">briefly stopped updating</a> for many users.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After Musk acquired X, formerly known as Twitter,&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/">for $44 billion in 2022</a>, he promptly slashed the company&#8217;s workforce by about 80%, from 7,500 employees to 1,300 workers. X had just 550 full-time engineers as of January 2023,&#160;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/10/elon-musks-social-platform-x-is-down-for-some-users-.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to CNBC</a>. A&#160;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285819/elon-musks-x-is-laying-off-employees-again" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new wave of layoffs</a>&#160;hit the company in November 2024, primarily affecting X&#8217;s engineering department.</p>
