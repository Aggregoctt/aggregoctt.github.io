<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Audible, Amazon&#8217;s audiobook service, <a href="https://www.audible.com/about/newsroom/audible-expands-catalog-with-ai-narration-and-translation-for-publishers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> on Tuesday that it&#8217;s partnering with select publishers to convert print and e-books into AI-narrated audiobooks. This initiative aims to quickly expand its catalog as it competes with Apple, Spotify, and others in the rapidly growing audiobook market.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Audible is leveraging Amazon&#8217;s AI capabilities to assist publishers in producing audiobooks. Publishers can choose from over 100 AI-generated voices available in English, French, Spanish, and Italian, with multiple accents and dialect options. The company plans to expand these options over time.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Additionally, Audible plans to roll out a beta version of AI translation later this year, offering both text-to-text and speech-to-speech translation services. This will support translations from English to Spanish, French, Italian, and German. Publishers will also have the option to get help from &#8220;professional linguists&#8221; to review these translations for accuracy, according to the company.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In 2023, Amazon<a href="https://www.kdpcommunity.com/s/article/Invite-Only-KDP-Beta-for-Audiobooks?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> introduced</a> an invite-only beta virtual voice tool for self-published authors in the U.S., enabling them to convert their e-books into audiobooks using synthetic speech tech. Last year, Audible <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/09/audible-recruits-voice-actors-to-train-audiobook-generating-ai/">invited a cohort of audiobook narrators </a>to train AI on their voices.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A search for &#8220;<a href="https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=virtual+voice&amp;k=virtual+voice" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">virtual voice</a>&#8221; on Audible reveals over 50,000 titles labeled &#8220;Narrated By: Virtual Voice,&#8221; indicating that the tech is popular among authors who may not have the resources to produce their own audiobooks.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Despite its widespread adoption, the introduction of AI-generated narrations has prompted debate within the publishing community and among listeners. Critics express concerns that these AI recordings might compromise the overall quality of audiobooks.&#160;</p>
