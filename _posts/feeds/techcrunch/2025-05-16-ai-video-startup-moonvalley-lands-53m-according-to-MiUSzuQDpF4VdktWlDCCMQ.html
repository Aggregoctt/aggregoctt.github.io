<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Roughly a month after&#160;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.moonvalley.com/">Moonvalley</a>, a Los Angeles-based startup developing AI tools for video creation, said it secured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/07/ai-video-startup-moonvalley-raised-a-fresh-43m-sec-filing-shows/">$43 million in new funding</a>, the company has raised more, according to a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://whalewisdom.com/filing/moonvalley-ai-inc-da-2025-05-15">filing</a> with the SEC.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The filing, submitted Thursday, reveals that Moonvalley actually landed (so far) around $53 million total from a group of 14 unnamed investors. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The filing indicates that this is an additional $10 million in cash, rather than a whole new round. It brings the company&#8217;s total raised to about $124 million, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/138788-47/company/profile">estimates Pitchbook</a>, following on the heels of Moonvalley&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/moonvalley-wants-to-build-more-ethical-video-models/">$70 million seed round</a> last November. Moonvalley declined to comment.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The wide availability of tools to build video generators has led to such an explosion of providers that the space is becoming saturated. Startups such as&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/16/runway-announces-an-api-for-its-video-generating-models/">Runway</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/28/lightricks-announces-ai-powered-filmmaking-studio-to-help-creators-visualize-stories/">Lightricks</a>, Genmo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/28/pika-labs-which-is-building-ai-tools-to-generate-and-edit-videos-raises-55m/">Pika</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/03/former-snap-ai-chief-launches-higgsfield-to-take-on-openais-sora-video-generator/">Higgsfield</a>, Kling,&#160;and <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/luma-ai-releases-ray2-generative-video-model-with-fast-natural-motion-and-better-physics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Luma</a>, as well as tech giants like&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/28/openai-plans-to-bring-soras-video-generator-to-chatgpt/">OpenAI</a>, Alibaba, and&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/23/googles-new-ai-video-model-veo-2-will-cost-50-cents-per-second/">Google</a>, are releasing models at a fast clip. In many cases, little distinguishes one model from another.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Moonvalley&#8217;s Marey model, built in collaboration with a&#160;<a href="https://www.indiewire.com/news/business/ai-animation-film-studio-asteria-bryn-mooser-interview-1235058404/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new AI animation studio</a>&#160;called Asteria, offers customization options like fine-grained camera and motion controls, and can generate &#8220;HD&#8221; clips up to 30 seconds long. Moonvalley claims it&#8217;s also lower risk than some other video generation models from a legal perspective.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But where Moonvalley is attempting to differentiate itself &#8212; hence the high VC interest &#8212; is on the data it&#8217;s using to train its models, as well as the safeguards in its video creation tools.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Many generative video startups train models on public data, some of which is invariably copyrighted. These companies argue that&#160;<a href="https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/#:~:text=Fair%20use%20is%20a%20legal,protected%20works%20in%20certain%20circumstances." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fair-use</a>&#160;doctrine shields the practice, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped rights holders&#160;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/music-publishers-ask-court-halt-ai-company-anthropics-use-lyrics-2023-11-17/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from lodging complaints</a>&#160;and filing cease and desists.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Moonvalley says it&#8217;s working with partners to handle licensing arrangements and package videos into datasets that the company then purchases. The approach is similar to Bria&#8217;s and&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/adobe-launches-firefly-ai-subscriptions/">Adobe&#8217;s</a>, the latter of which procures content for training from creators through its proprietary Adobe Stock platform.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Moonvalley is also crafting an interface for its model. The company&#8217;s software, which it hasn&#8217;t previewed publicly yet, has storyboarding and &#8220;granular&#8221; clip adjustment tools, Moonvalley&#8217;s co-founders revealed in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.moonvalley.com/beyondtheframe/founders-roundtable-creating-transformational-technology">recent interviews</a>. Marey can generate videos not only from text prompts but sketches, photos, and other video clips, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.moonvalley.com/beyondtheframe/our-vision-for-generative-video">claims</a> Moonvalle<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.moonvalley.com/beyondtheframe/our-vision-for-generative-video">y</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Naeem Talukdar, who previously led product growth at Zapier, founded Moonvalley with former DeepMind scientists Mateusz Malinowski and Mik Binkowski. John Thomas joined as Moonvalley&#8217;s COO &#8212; he and Talukdar had founded another startup, Draft, several years ago. Moonvalley also counts Asteria head Bryn Mooser as a co-founder. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Many artists and creators are understandably wary of video generators, as they threaten to upend the film and television industry. A 2024&#160;<a href="https://animationguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Future-Unscripted-The-Impact-of-Generative-Artificial-Intelligence-on-Entertainment-Industry-Jobs-pages-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">study</a>&#160;commissioned by the Animation Guild, a union representing Hollywood animators and cartoonists, estimates that more than 100,000 U.S.-based film, television, and animation jobs will be disrupted by AI by 2026.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Moonvalley intends to allow creators to request their content be removed from its models, let customers delete their data at any time, and offer an&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/some-gen-ai-vendors-say-theyll-defend-customers-from-ip-lawsuits-others-not-so-much/">indemnity policy</a>&#160;to protect its users from copyright challenges.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Unlike some &#8220;unfiltered&#8221; video models that readily insert a person&#8217;s likeness into clips, Moonvalley is also committing to building guardrails around its tools. Like OpenAI&#8217;s Sora, Moonvalley&#8217;s models will block certain content, like NSFW phrases, and won&#8217;t allow users to prompt them to generate videos of specific people or celebrities.</p>
