<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Microsoft and law enforcement have <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/21/microsoft-leads-global-action-against-favored-cybercrime-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> a court-authorized takedown of Lumma, a prolific <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#infostealers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">info-stealer malware</a> operation found on more than 394,000 Windows PCs globally, mostly in Brazil, Europe, and the United States.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The tech giant took civil action to ask a federal court to seize 2,300 domains that served as the malware&#8217;s network of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#command-and-control-c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">command and control</a> servers. The Justice Department also <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-seizes-domains-behind-major-information-stealing-malware-operation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">seized five domains</a> used to operate the Lumma infrastructure.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Lumma password stealer can be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/valve-removes-video-game-demo-suspected-of-being-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found in dodgy games</a> or cracked apps downloaded from the internet. Once infected, the malware steals logins, passwords, credit cards, and cryptocurrency wallets from the victim&#8217;s computer, which are sold to other cybercriminals. Lumma also serves as a backdoor for hackers who want to drop additional malware, like ransomware.</p>
