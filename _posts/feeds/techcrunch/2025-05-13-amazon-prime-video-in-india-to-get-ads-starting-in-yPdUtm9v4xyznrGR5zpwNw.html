<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Amazon will bring ads to movies and shows on Prime Video in India starting June 17, over a year after introducing ads in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/22/amazon-prime-video-will-start-showing-ads-from-early-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">markets including the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Canada</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">On Tuesday, Amazon emailed Prime members in India to announce the rollout of &#8220;limited advertisements&#8221; on content streaming on Prime Video. Amazon originally announced in October that it would serve Prime Video ads in India starting sometime this year, without sharing specifics.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A spokesperson told TechCrunch that Amazon is also introducing an ad-free Prime Video add-on at an introductory price of 699 Indian rupees (roughly $8) a year or 129 Indian rupees (roughly $1.52) a month that Prime members will be able to purchase on top of their existing membership. The spokesperson didn&#8217;t share additional details, however.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Last year, Amazon launched a $3 monthly add-on in the U.S. to offer an ad-free experience to Prime Video viewers. That move reportedly helped the tech giant secure <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazons-upfront-ad-haul-tops-1-8-billion-target?rc=u2tpxn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more than $1.8 billion in ad spending commitments</a> for its video streaming service. The company revealed this week that <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/prime-video-reach-130-million-us-amazon-says-1236213847/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more than 130 million viewers in the U.S.</a> are watching Prime Video with ads, up from 115 million last year.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Alongside Prime Video, Amazon has MX Player in India that includes ads to help the company generate additional advertising revenue. The service, which Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/06/amazon-buys-indian-video-streaming-service-mx-player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired from Times Internet</a> last year, offers a <a href="https://support.mxplayer.in/support/solutions/articles/43000608796-how-can-i-get-rid-of-advertisements-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subscription to limit the ads users see</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Amazon Prime in India <a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G34EUPKVMYFW8N2U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">starts</a> at 299 Indian rupees (roughly $3.50) a month and goes up to 1,499 Indian rupees (roughly $17.57).</p>
