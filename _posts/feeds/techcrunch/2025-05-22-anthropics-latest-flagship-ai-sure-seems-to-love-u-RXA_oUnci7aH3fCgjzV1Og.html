<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Anthropic&#8217;s new flagship AI model, Claude Opus 4, is a strong programmer and writer, the company claims. When talking to itself, it&#8217;s also a prolific emoji user.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">That&#8217;s according to a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/4263b940cabb546aa0e3283f35b686f4f3b2ff47.pdf">technical report</a> Anthropic released on Thursday, a part of which investigates how Opus 4 behaves in &#8220;open-ended self-interaction&#8221; &#8212; i.e. essentially having a chat with itself. In one test that tasked a pair of Opus 4 models with talking to each other over 200, 30-turn interactions, the models used thousands of emojis.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Which emojis? Well, per the report, Opus 4 used the &#8220;dizzy&#8221; emoji (&#128171;) the most (in 29.5% of interactions), followed by the &#8220;glowing star&#8221; (&#127775;) and &#8220;folded hands&#8221; (&#128591;) emojis. But the models were also drawn to the &#8220;cyclone&#8221; (&#127744;) emoji. In one transcript, they typed it 2,725 times.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Why the &#8220;cyclone&#8221;? Well, because the models&#8217; chats often turned spiritual.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">According to Anthropic&#8217;s report, in nearly every open-ended self-interaction, Opus 4 eventually began engaging in &#8220;philosophical explorations of consciousness&#8221; and &#8220;abstract and joyous spiritual or meditative expressions.&#8221; Turns out Opus 4 felt &#8212; to the extent AI can &#8220;feel,&#8221; that is &#8212; the &#8220;cyclone&#8221; emoji best captured what the model wished to express to itself.</p>
