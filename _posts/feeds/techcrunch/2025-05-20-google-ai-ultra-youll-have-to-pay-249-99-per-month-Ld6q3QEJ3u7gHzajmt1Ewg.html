<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Google is launching a new subscription plan called Google AI Ultra to bring more of its AI products under one roof.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The new plan, announced at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/storyline/google-i-o-2025-live-coverage-gemini-android-16-updates-and-more/">Google I/O 2025 on Tuesday</a>, delivers the &#8220;highest level of access&#8221; to Google&#8217;s AI-powered apps and services, the tech giant says. Priced at $249.99 per month, AI Ultra includes Google&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/googles-veo-3-can-generate-videos-and-soundtracks-to-go-along-with-them/">Veo 3 video generator</a>, the company&#8217;s new Flow video editing app, and a powerful AI capability called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/deep-think-boosts-the-performance-of-googles-flagship-google-gemini-ai-model/">Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Think mode</a> (which hasn&#8217;t launched yet).</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;[Ultra is] for people that want to be on the absolute cutting edge of AI from Google,&#8221; Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs and Gemini, said during a press briefing. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">AI Ultra, which is U.S.-only for now, joins a growing group of ultra-premium AI subscriptions. Late last year, OpenAI unveiled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/06/will-people-really-pay-200-a-month-for-openais-new-chatbot/">ChatGPT Pro</a>, a $200-per-month plan with increased ChatGPT rate limits and certain exclusive capabilities. Anthropic followed suit a few months later with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/anthropic-rolls-out-a-200-per-month-claude-subscription/">Claude Max</a>, which also costs up to $200 per month.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google hopes to sweeten the pot by throwing in lots of extras.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In addition to Flow, Veo 3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Think, AI Ultra comes with higher limits in Google&#8217;s NotebookLM platform and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/google-whisk-an-image-remixing-tool-is-now-available-in-100-countries/">Whisk</a>, the company&#8217;s image remixing app. Subscribers to AI Ultra also get access to Google&#8217;s Gemini chatbot in Chrome, certain &#8220;agentic&#8221; tools powered by the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/google-unveils-project-mariner-ai-agents-to-use-the-web-for-you/">Project Mariner</a> tech, YouTube Premium, and 30TB of storage across Google Drive, Google Photos, and Gmail.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">One of those agentic tools is Agent Mode, which will arrive on desktop &#8220;soon.&#8221; Google says that Agent Mode will be able to browse the web, perform research, and integrate with Google apps to handle specific tasks. </p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Coinciding with the debut of AI Ultra, Google is replacing its old Google One AI Premium plan with Google AI Pro. AI Pro will include products like Flow, NotebookLM, and the Gemini app formerly known as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://gemini.google/advanced/?hl=en">Gemini Advanced</a>, all with special features and higher rate limits.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">AI Pro subscribers also get Flow and early access to Gemini in Chrome, as well as real-time speech translation in Google Meet in English and Spanish (with additional languages to come). Speech translation in Google Meet, which is also available for AI Ultra customers, translates spoken words into a listener&#8217;s preferred language while preserving the voice, tone, and expression.</p>
