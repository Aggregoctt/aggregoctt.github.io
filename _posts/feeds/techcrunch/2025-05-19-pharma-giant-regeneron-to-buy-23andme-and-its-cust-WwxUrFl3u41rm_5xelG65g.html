<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Pharmaceutical maker Regeneron <a href="https://investor.regeneron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/regeneron-enters-asset-purchase-agreement-acquire-23andmer-256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced Monday</a> it will buy genetic testing company 23andMe for $256 million following a bankruptcy auction.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Regeneron said it will acquire 23andMe&#8217;s genomics service and its bank of 15 million customers&#8217; personal and genetic data as part of the deal. The pharma giant said it plans to use the 23andMe customer data to help drug discovery, and that it will &#8220;prioritize the privacy, security, and ethical use of 23andMe&#8217;s customer data.&#8221;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">23andMe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/23/dna-testing-company-23andme-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-resigns/">filed for bankruptcy protection in March</a> after a data breach <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/04/23andme-confirms-hackers-stole-ancestry-data-on-6-9-million-users/">exposed the private and genetic data of 7 million customers</a> throughout 2023. The company&#8217;s stock price also plummeted to near-zero amid waning consumer interest in the company&#8217;s DNA testing kits. 23andMe&#8217;s founder and chief executive Anne Wojcicki resigned from the company following the company&#8217;s collapse.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After its filing, a federal bankruptcy court was appointed to oversee the sale of 23andMe&#8217;s assets, sparking concerns that the stores of customer data <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/24/23andme-faces-an-uncertain-future-so-does-your-genetic-data/">could be sold to adversarial nations or unethical buyers</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Regeneron said in its statement that as the named buyer in the bankruptcy auction, it &#8220;intends to ensure compliance&#8221; with 23andMe&#8217;s privacy policies and laws regarding customer data.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The bankruptcy court is set to consider Regeneron&#8217;s acquisition on June 17. Regeneron said it will not acquire 23andMe&#8217;s Lemonaid Health business.</p>
