<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">President Trump lashed out at Apple on Friday, threatening the company with a 25% tariff on iPhones unless it moves production to the U.S.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone&#8217;s [sic] that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,&#8221; Trump wrote on Truth Social. &#8220;If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank you for your attention to this matter!&#8221;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Trump&#8217;s post comes days after Apple&#8217;s major manufacturing partner, Foxconn, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/apple-supplier-foxconn-invest-15-billion-india-unit-2025-05-20/">announced a $1.5 billion investment</a> in its India unit. Apple has been looking to shift hardware production to India as the trade war with China under President Trump takes unpredictable twists and turns. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In an earnings call earlier this month, Cook said that the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. &#8220;will have India as their country of origin.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">President Trump expressed his displeasure over Apple&#8217;s shift to India last week while he was in the Middle East, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/15/politics/video/trump-problem-tim-cook-apple-tariffs-digvid">according to CNN</a>. The two men also met on Tuesday, the outlet reported, although details on what they discussed were slim.</p>
