<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Google&#8217;s Gemini AI app now has more than 400 million monthly active users, CEO Sundar Pichai said during a press briefing ahead of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/storyline/google-i-o-2025-live-coverage-gemini-android-16-updates-and-more/%E2%86%97/">Google I/O 2025</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google&#8217;s AI chatbot app is now approaching a similar scale to OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT app. According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/google-gemini-has-350m-monthly-users-reveals-court-hearing/">recent court filings</a>, Google estimated in March that ChatGPT had around 600 million MAUs, whereas Gemini only had 350 million MAUs.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The rise of ChatGPT presents a significant threat to Google&#8217;s Search business, offering users with a new, more interactive way to access information on the web. The Gemini app is Google&#8217;s most direct challenge to compete with OpenAI in the chatbot era, and it seems to be working out so far &#8212; the Gemini app seems to be successfully pulling users away from ChatGPT.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In recent months, Google has shaken up the ranks behind Gemini. The Google leader behind the viral NotebookLM app, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.semafor.com/article/04/02/2025/google-gemini-shakes-up-ai-leadership-sissie-hsiao-steps-down-replaced-by-josh-woodward">Josh Woodward, is now in charge of Gemini</a>, part of an effort to generate some buzz around Google&#8217;s AI chatbot.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Of course, the Gemini app is just one way Google puts its AI in front of users. Pichai also said during the call that Google&#8217;s AI overviews now reach more than 1.5 billion users every month. The company also announced during Google I/O 2025 that it&#8217;s putting AI mode in front of more users, as Google tries to update Search with more conversational experiences powered by generative AI.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While OpenAI and Google have the most widely used AI chatbot apps, Meta is trying to break into the space as well. CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said Meta&#8217;s AI products have more than a billion monthly active users across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/meta-launches-a-standalone-ai-app-to-compete-with-chatgpt/">recently launched an AI chatbot app</a> to compete with ChatGPT and Gemini.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While the ChatGPT app was the only game in town a few years ago, it&#8217;s now got a healthy dose of competition from Big Tech&#8217;s largest players.</p>
