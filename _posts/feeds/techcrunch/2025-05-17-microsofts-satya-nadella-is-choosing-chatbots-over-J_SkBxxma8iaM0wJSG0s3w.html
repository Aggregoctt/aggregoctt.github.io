<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">While Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says he likes podcasts, he might not actually be listening to them anymore.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">That tidbit comes towards the end of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-15/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-his-ai-efforts-and-openai-partnership?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NzQ0MDExNywiZXhwIjoxNzQ4MDQ0OTE3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTV0JNQ1FUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCNjVFOTM5Mjc2NzA0M0QzODY0NDRDMDdBRDc0OTE2NiJ9.y7u-8QK7MCMqjKVlR5fO6u5JG1Iel4Hrm7YF3XE4u64">a longer Bloomberg profile of Nadella</a>, with a focus on Microsoft&#8217;s AI strategy and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/11/microsoft-and-openai-may-be-renegotiating-their-partnership/">its complicated relationship with OpenAI</a>. To illustrate how much he uses the company&#8217;s Copilot AI assistant in his daily life, Nadella said that instead of listening to podcasts, he now uploads the transcripts to Copilot, then talks to Copilot about the content during his drive to the office.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In addition, Nadella &#8212; who jokingly described his job as &#8220;email typist&#8221; &#8212; said he relies on at least 10 custom agents developed in Copilot Studio to summarize emails and messages, prepare for meetings, and perform other tasks around the office.</p>
