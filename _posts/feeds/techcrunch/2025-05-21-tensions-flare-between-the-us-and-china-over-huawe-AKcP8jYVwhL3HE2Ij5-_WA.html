<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Just a few weeks after the U.S. and China made significant steps to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/05/joint-statement-on-u-s-china-economic-and-trade-meeting-in-geneva/">de-escalate the growing trade war</a> between the two countries, tensions are flaring again &#8212;&#160;this time over semiconductors.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">China&#8217;s Commerce Ministry in Beijing released a statement on Wednesday that threatened legal action against anyone who enforces U.S. export restrictions on Huawei&#8217;s AI chips, according to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-21/us-china-tensions-over-chips-risk-hurting-trade-truce-dialogue">reporting from Bloomberg</a>.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This statement is in response to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/trump-administration-officially-rescinds-bidens-ai-diffusion-rules/">set of &#8220;guidelines&#8221;</a> released by the Trump administration on May 13 &#8212; alongside the revocation of Joe Biden&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion rule &#8212; that reminded companies that using Huawei&#8217;s Ascend AI chips &#8220;anywhere in the world&#8221; was a violation of U.S. export rules.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Earlier this week, China said the Trump administration <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-19/china-accuses-us-of-undermining-geneva-talks-with-huawei-stance">had undermined recent trade talks</a> by issuing that guidance.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The U.S. Commerce Department has since changed the wording of its original May 13 guidance to remove the &#8220;anywhere in the world&#8221; phrase, according to Bloomberg.</p>
