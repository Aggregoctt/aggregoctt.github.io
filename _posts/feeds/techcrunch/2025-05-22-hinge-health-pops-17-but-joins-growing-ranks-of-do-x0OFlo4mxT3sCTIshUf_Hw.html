<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Hinge Health, a digital physical therapist company, closed its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday at $37.56, up about 17% over the $32 IPO price it set the previous day.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">That&#8217;s a good first-day result. But even with the pop, Hinge&#8217;s public valuation is significantly less than its last private market one. The 11-year-old company&#8217;s approximate market capitalization, excluding employee options, was about $3 billion, which is less than half of the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/tiger-coatue-double-down-on-hinge-health-with-new-400m-infusion/"> $6.2 billion Hinge</a> attained in its October 2021 Series E funding round, which was led by Tiger Global Management.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Until recently, companies went to great lengths to avoid down-round IPOs. However, the stigma associated with going public below the last private valuation has lessened significantly if that valuation was during the heady 2020-2021 era.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Companies whose IPOs are priced lower than their last private valuation by VCs include Reddit, which debuted last year at about<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/reddit-prices-ipo-at-34-per-share-the-top-of-the-range/"> $5.4 billion, roughly half</a> its $10 billion valuation from 2021.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Another example is ServiceTitan, whose IPO valued it at<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/11/servicetitan-prices-at-71-above-expected-range-.html"> about $6.3 billion</a>, below the $<a rel="nofollow" href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/if-servicetitan-can-go-public-so-can-you">7.6 billion valuation</a> it secured in a Series H round two years earlier.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Hinge Health&#8217;s IPO raised $437 million, with about $237 million in proceeds going directly to the company and the remainder to its existing investors. The company&#8217;s largest outside shareholders are Insight Partners, which holds 19% of all stock, and Atomico, which has 15% of all shares. Other venture capital firms that own approximately 8% of Hinge&#8217;s shares include 11.2 Capital, Coatue, Tiger Global, and Bessemer Venture Partners, according to the<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673743/000119312525121827/d829170ds1a.htm#rom829170_16"> company&#8217;s latest S1 filing</a>. Co-founders Daniel Perez and Gabriel Mecklenburg own 18.9% and 8.2%, respectively.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company aims to reduce musculoskeletal pain with the help of wearable sensors and computer vision technology remotely monitored by a clinical care team of physical therapists, physicians, and board-certified health coaches.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Omada Health, another digital health company,<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1611115/000119312525116907/d785770ds1.htm#toc785770_17"> filed to go public</a> earlier this month.&#160; The 13-year-old startup offers virtual care between doctors&#8217; visits for chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension and competes with Hinge Health in the musculoskeletal pain reduction space. Omada&#8217;s biggest shareholders include U.S. Venture Partners and Andreessen Horowitz, which was last valued in 2022 at just above<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/omada-health-hits-unicorn-status-192m-fidelity-led-series-e"> $1 billion</a>.</p>
