<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">OpenAI is releasing its GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1 mini AI models in ChatGPT, the company announced in a <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1922707554745909391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a> Wednesday.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The GPT-4.1 models should help software engineers who are using ChatGPT to write or debug code, OpenAI spokesperson Shaokyi Amdo told TechCrunch. GPT-4.1 excels at coding and instruction following compared to GPT-4o, according to OpenAI, but is faster than its o-series of reasoning models.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company says it&#8217;s now rolling out GPT-4.1 to subscribers to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team. Meanwhile, OpenAI is releasing GPT-4.1 mini for free and paying users of ChatGPT. As a result of this update, OpenAI is removing GPT-4.0 mini from ChatGPT for all users, the company notes in <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GPT-4.1&#8217;s release notes</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">OpenAI <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/14/openais-new-gpt-4-1-models-focus-on-coding/">launched GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1 mini in April,</a> but only released the models through its developer-facing API. At the time, the company faced criticism from the AI research community for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/openai-ships-gpt-4-1-without-a-safety-report/">shipping GPT-4.1 without a safety report.</a> These researchers claimed OpenAI was lowering its standards around transparency into its AI models. However, OpenAI argued at the time that &#8212; despite GPT-4.1&#8217;s improved performance and speed compared to GPT-4o &#8212; this model was not a frontier model, and thus did not require the same safety reporting that more capable models do. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;GPT-4.1 doesn&#8217;t introduce new modalities or ways of interacting with the model, and doesn&#8217;t surpass o3 in intelligence,&#8221; said OpenAI&#8217;s Head of Safety Systems Johannes Heidecke in a <a href="https://x.com/JoHeidecke/status/1922712374152146964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a> Wednesday. &#8220;This means that the safety considerations here, while substantial, are different from frontier models.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Now, OpenAI is releasing more information about GPT-4.1 and all its AI models. Earlier on Wednesday, OpenAI <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/openai-pledges-to-publish-ai-safety-test-results-more-often/">committed to publish the results of its internal AI model safety evaluations</a> more frequently as part of an effort to increase transparency. Those results will live in OpenAI&#8217;s new Safety Evaluations Hub, which it launched on Wednesday. </p>
