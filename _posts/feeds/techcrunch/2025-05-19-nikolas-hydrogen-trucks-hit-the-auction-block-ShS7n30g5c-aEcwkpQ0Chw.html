<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Nikola&#8217;s hydrogen trucks are officially up for auction, one of the company&#8217;s last big steps in unloading all of its assets after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/19/troubled-electric-truck-maker-nikola-files-for-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filing for bankruptcy in February</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Auction house Gordon Brothers reached an agreement with Nikola in Delaware bankruptcy court to purchase the hydrogen trucking assets late last week. Over the weekend, Gordon Brothers published the <a href="https://assets.gordonbrothers.com/auctions/info/id/189" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">listing</a> and a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25947648-nikola-brochure-may-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">brochure</a> detailing everything for sale. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The auction house says it has around $114 million worth of hydrogen trucks, raw material, and sub-assemblies. That includes 103 finished hydrogen fuel cell-powered trucks, along with spare batteries, tires, and other components. Gordon Brothers is also auctioning off Nikola&#8217;s hydrogen storage, refueling, and testing equipment, some of which is still brand new.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The hydrogen assets are hitting the market a little more than a month after EV startup Lucid Motors emerged as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/lucid-motors-wins-bankruptcy-auction-for-nikolas-arizona-factory-and-other-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprise buyer</a> of Nikola&#8217;s Arizona manufacturing facility and headquarters. Lucid also agreed to bring around 300 Nikola employees on board as part of that transaction, in exchange for roughly $30 million in cash and non-cash considerations.</p>
