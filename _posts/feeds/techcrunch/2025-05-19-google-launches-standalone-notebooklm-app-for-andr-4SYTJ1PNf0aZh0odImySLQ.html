<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Google has officially released the NotebookLM app for Android, a day before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/16/google-i-o-2025-what-to-expect-including-updates-to-gemini-and-android-16/">Google I/O 2025</a> and a day before the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/googles-notebooklm-android-and-ios-apps-are-available-for-pre-order/">said it would roll out</a>. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Since its&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/08/googles-ai-assisted-notebooklm-note-taking-app-now-open-users-us/">launch in 2023</a>, the AI-based note-taking and research assistant has only been accessible via desktop. Google has now made the service available on the go.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The iOS app is expected to launch Tuesday.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">NotebookLM is designed to help people better understand complex information through features like smart summaries and the ability to ask questions about documents and other materials.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Android app gives access to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/googles-notebooklm-expands-its-ai-podcast-feature-to-more-languages/">Audio Overviews</a>, which are NotebookLM&#8217;s AI-generated podcasts based on the source material. There is background playback and offline support for Audio Overviews.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Android app also allows people to create new notebooks and view the ones they&#8217;ve already created. Users can also upload new sources from their device and view those that have already uploaded in each of the notebooks.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The app features a light and dark mode that is applied based on the device&#8217;s system settings.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Given the timing of the launch, Google may share more about the app during the company&#8217;s I/O keynote Tuesday.</p>
