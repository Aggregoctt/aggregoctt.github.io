<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">CEOs are now so immersed in AI, they&#8217;re sending their avatars to address quarterly earnings calls instead of themselves, at least partially.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/klarna-used-an-ai-avatar-of-its-ceo-to-deliver-earnings-it-said/">Klarna CEO&#8217;s AI avatar appeared on an investor call</a> earlier this week, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan followed suit, also <a rel="nofollow" href="https://investor.zoom.us/rec/play/ddLEN0Kpp9Io350gAiMhUZrmEwWf-sI9wHlMcXhldt1vyBORA1ZOgmdkJfnY88vib0FvsI3ZRvBnT5xM.Shfzcoi6wDAazcCV?eagerLoadZvaPages=sidemenu.billing.plan_management&amp;accessLevel=meeting&amp;canPlayFromShare=true&amp;from=share_recording_detail&amp;startTime=1747861270000&amp;componentName=rec-play&amp;originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2F3jjEAtxIXGatQ4gKQEhHSsCqoTSQlkvFjak7r46xC2Hr9gjZdUppgIzmU2RfTYJP.oyGooIDB2oHbvVQ_%3FstartTime%3D1747861270000">using his avatar for initial comments</a>. Yuan deployed his custom avatar via Zoom Clips, the company&#8217;s asynchronous video creation tool.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;I am proud to be among the first CEOs to use an avatar in an earnings call,&#8221; he &#8212; or rather his avatar &#8212; said. &#8220;It is just one example of how Zoom is pushing the boundaries of communication and collaboration. At the same time, we know trust and security are essential. We take AI-generated content seriously and have built in strong safeguards to prevent misuse, protect user identity, and ensure avatars are used responsibly.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Yuan has long advocated for using avatars in meetings and has previously said that the company aims to create <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24168733/zoom-ceo-ai-clones-digital-twins-videoconferencing-decoder-interview">digital twins of users</a>. He&#8217;s not alone in this vision; the CEO of AI-powered transcription service Otter is reportedly training his own avatar to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-04-15/meetings-won-t-be-the-same-when-the-ceo-sends-an-ai-bot">share the workload</a>.</p>
