<p class="wp-block-paragraph">One of the speakers taking part is Rob Biederman, managing partner at <a href="https://www.acp.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Asymmetric Capital Partners</a> and one of the sharpest minds in talent, tech, and scaling strategy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-biederman-brings-to-techcrunch-all-stage">What Biederman brings to TechCrunch All Stage</h2>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Simply put, he&#8217;s built solutions where most startups get stuck and is set on sharing those fixes to those in need.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Before launching Asymmetric, Biederman co-founded <a href="https://catalant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Catalant Technologies</a>, where he spent eight years as co-CEO turning the company into the market leader for on-demand, high-skill talent. Today, Catalant powers how major companies deploy workforces, connecting them with more than 70,000 consultants and 1,000 boutique firms.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">He now serves as chairman of Catalant, is the co-author of &#8220;<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Reimagining+Work%3A+Strategies+to+Disrupt+Talent%2C+Lead+Change%2C+and+Win+with+a+Flexible+Workforce-p-9781119389651" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reimagining Work</a>,&#8221; and teaches scaling technology ventures at Harvard Business School, where he&#8217;s an executive fellow. In short, Biederman doesn&#8217;t just talk about scale &#8212; he teaches it, builds it, and funds it.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">With a background that includes private equity at Goldman Sachs and Bain Capital, and a Harvard MBA earned with Baker Scholar honors, Biederman brings both operational experience and investment discipline to every conversation.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/techcrunch-all-stage-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>TechCrunch All Stage</strong></a>, Biederman will break down what most founders overlook when it comes to scaling: how to evolve your thinking about talent, execution, and long-term growth.</p>
