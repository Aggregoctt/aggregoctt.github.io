<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">xAI blamed an &#8220;unauthorized modification&#8221; for a bug in its AI-powered Grok chatbot that caused Grok to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/xai/status/1923183620606619649">repeatedly refer to</a> &#8220;white genocide in South Africa&#8221; when invoked in certain contexts on X.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">On Wednesday, Grok began replying to dozens of posts on X with information about white genocide in South Africa, even in response to unrelated subjects. The strange replies stemmed from the X account for Grok, which responds to users with AI-generated posts whenever a person tags &#8220;@grok.&#8221;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">According to a post Thursday from xAI&#8217;s official X account, a change was made Wednesday morning to the Grok bot&#8217;s system prompt &#8212; the high-level instructions that guide the bot&#8217;s behavior &#8212; that directed Grok to provide a &#8220;specific response&#8221; on a &#8220;political topic.&#8221; xAI says that the tweak &#8220;violated [its] internal policies and core values,&#8221; and that the company has &#8220;conducted a thorough investigation.&#8221; </p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It&#8217;s the second time xAI has publicly acknowledged an unauthorized change to Grok&#8217;s code caused the AI to respond in controversial ways.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In February, Grok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/23/grok-3-appears-to-have-briefly-censored-unflattering-mentions-of-trump-and-musk/">briefly censored</a> unflattering mentions of Donald Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of xAI and owner of X. Igor Babuschkin, an xAI engineering lead,&#160;said that Grok had been instructed by a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/24/xai-chief-engineer-blames-former-openai-employee-grok-blocks-musk-trump-misinformation/">rogue employee</a> to ignore sources that mentioned Musk or Trump spreading misinformation, and that xAI reverted the change as soon as users began pointing it out.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">xAI said on Thursday that it&#8217;s going to make several changes to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Beginning today, xAI will <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/xai-org/grok-prompts">publish Grok&#8217;s system prompts</a> on GitHub as well as a changelog. The company says it&#8217;ll also &#8220;put in place additional checks and measures&#8221; to ensure that xAI employees can&#8217;t modify the system prompt without review and establish a &#8220;24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok&#8217;s answers that are not caught by automated systems.&#8221;</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Despite Musk&#8217;s frequent warnings of the dangers of&#160;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/23/tech/elon-musk-ai-your-job" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AI</a>&#160;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cindygordon/2024/02/26/elon-musks-urgent-warning-a-digital-god-is-already-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gone</a>&#160;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/big-tech-ceos-ai-meeting-senators-musk-zuckerberg-rcna104738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">unchecked</a>, xAI has a poor AI safety track record. <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/gross-elon-musks-grok-ai-will-undress-photos-of-women-on-x-if-you-ask" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A recent report</a>&#160;found that Grok would undress photos of women when asked. The chatbot can also be&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/08/grok-may-soon-get-an-unhinged-mode/">considerably more crass</a>&#160;than AI like Google&#8217;s Gemini and ChatGPT, cursing without much restraint to speak of.</p>
