<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">TikTok is launching in-app guided meditation exercises, the social network announced on Thursday. The company began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/tiktok-now-lets-parents-see-their-teens-follower-following-list-block-access-during-certain-hours/">testing the meditation exercises</a> with select teens earlier this year and is now making the feature available to all users on its app.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The idea behind the feature is to help users improve their sleep quality and encourage them to put the app down during those late-night endless scrolling sessions. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">For teen under the age of 18, meditation will be turned on by default. If a teen is using the app after 10pm, their For You feed will be interrupted by a guided meditation exercise that encourages them to wind down for the night. The meditation features a calming screen and soft music alongside breathing exercises. </p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">If teens choose to ignore the message and continue to use the app, they will see a second full-screen prompt that will nudge them to go to sleep. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">TikTok has been introducing new teen safety features over the past few years in response to concerns over&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/03/tiktok-affect-kids-teens-state-attorney-bipartisan/">the app&#8217;s impact</a>&#160;on its youngest users.&#160;The new meditation feature marks the company&#8217;s latest effort to appease lawmakers.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Adults who are interested in the meditation feature can turn it on by navigating to the app&#8217;s Screen Time settings page. From there, you just need to toggle on the &#8220;sleep hours&#8221; feature. You can choose what time you want to see the meditation exercise each night. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">TikTok also announced that it&#8217;s going to donate $2.3 million in ad credits to 31 mental health organizations in 19 countries around the world as part of its Mental Health Education Fund.</p>
