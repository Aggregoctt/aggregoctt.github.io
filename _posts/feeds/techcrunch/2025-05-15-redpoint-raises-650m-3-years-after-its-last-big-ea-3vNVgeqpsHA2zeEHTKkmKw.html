<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Redpoint Ventures, a San Francisco-based firm that is about a quarter century old, has raised a $650 million 10th early-stage fund, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2063836/000110465925048595/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">regulatory filing</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Redpoint&#8217;s new fund matches the size of its prior fund, which was raised just under<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/01/techs-riskiest-founders-are-getting-a-650-million-bet-from-redpoint-ventures/"> three years ago</a>. In a market where many venture firms are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/03/vc-fundraising/">decreasing their capital hauls</a>, this consistency could indicate the firm&#8217;s limited partners are relatively happy with its performance.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The firm&#8217;s early-stage strategy is managed by four managing partners: Alex Bard (pictured above), Satish Dharmaraj, Annie Kadavy, and Erica Brescia, who joined the firm in 2021 after serving as GitHub&#8217;s COO for nearly three years.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The early-stage team&#8217;s recent prominent investments include AI coding startup Poolside, which was founded by former Redpoint partner and GitHub CTO Jason Warner, a distributed SQL database developer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/15/cockroach-labs-shakes-up-its-licensing-to-force-bigger-companies-to-pay/">Cockroach Labs</a>, and procurement management platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/18/procurement-management-platform-levelpath-raises-30m/">Levelpath</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The multistage firm also runs a growth strategy, led by partners Logan Bartlett, Jacob Effron, Elliot Geidt, and Scott Raney. Last year, Redpoint raised its fifth growth-stage fund at $740 million, a slight increase from its $725 million fund closed three years prior.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Redpoint&#8217;s recent exits include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/20/next-insurance-gets-scooped-up-by-munich-re-for-2-6b/">Next Insurance</a>, which was sold for $2.6 billion in March; food and travel media startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/food-delivery-startup-wonder-acquires-media-company-tastemade-for-90m/">Tastemade, which was scooped</a> up by Wonder for $90 million; and IBM, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/ibm-closes-6-4b-hashicorp-acquisition/">acquired </a> HashiCorp for $6.4 billion.</p>
