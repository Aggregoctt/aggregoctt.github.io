<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">We&#8217;re ecstatic to announce that Kisson Lin, founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.tanka.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tanka</a>, will be joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-ai/?utm_source=tc&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=tcsessionsai&amp;utm_content=post_kissonlin_05052025&amp;promo=post_kissonlin_05052025&amp;display=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>TechCrunch Sessions: AI</strong></a> for a provocative &#8212; and instructive &#8212; interview titled &#8220;Your Next Co-Founder Will Be AI.&#8221; She&#8217;s among the many excellent speakers joining the AI conference on June 5 at UC Berkeley&#8217;s Zellerbach Hall, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-ai/?utm_source=tc&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=tcsessionsai&amp;utm_content=post_kissonlin_05052025&amp;promo=post_kissonlin_05052025&amp;display=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there&#8217;s still plenty of time to register</a> to get your seat at the table to learn from their expertise &#8212; with up to $600 in savings.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">If you don&#8217;t already know Lin, her company powers an AI messenger with long-term memory that self-learns and evolves with teams. Before founding Tanka, Lin worked at several tech giants, including Meta, where she was based in Singapore, and at TikTok, where from Beijing she helped lead the company&#8217;s e-commerce and ads monetization strategies.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">She&#8217;s also a repeat entrepreneur, having previously co-founded Mindverse AI, where as the company&#8217;s COO, she helped developed products, including Me.bot, an AI note-taking app with memory capabilities, and MindOS, an AI agent operating system.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Indeed, Lin &#8212; who has a master&#8217;s degree in data science and business statistics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong &#8212; has built an impressive career at the intersection of AI, memory systems, and team collaboration tools. A self-described &#8220;longtime neuroscience enthusiast and amateur sci-fi writer,&#8221; she is particularly fascinated by how memory shapes intelligence, a passion that directly informs Tanka&#8217;s approach to AI.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At TechCrunch Sessions: AI, Lin will discuss how Tanka&#8217;s AI memory technology can make teams far more efficient &#8212; a model that has powerful implications for solo founders looking to compete with larger organizations. (Since its beta launch in October 2024, Tanka says users have already saved the equivalent of 111 workdays through the platform&#8217;s AI-generated smart replies.)</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But she&#8217;ll also be talking more broadly about some of the tools and processes that are now making it possible for solopreneurs to build big businesses without massive teams &#8212; and also without excessive amounts of venture funding.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The interview is part of our broader program featuring top AI leaders, including Anthropic co-founder Jared Kaplan, Databricks co-founder and UC Berkeley professor Ion Stoica, and DeepMind senior product manager Logan Kilpatrick.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">With approximately 1,000 attendees expected, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-ai/?utm_source=tc&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=tcsessionsai&amp;utm_content=post_kissonlin_05052025&amp;promo=post_kissonlin_05052025&amp;display=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TechCrunch Sessions: AI is a must-attend event for AI developers and founders</a> navigating the rapidly evolving AI ecosystem. If you&#8217;re building an AI startup &#8212; or planning to launch one &#8212; this event offers crucial insights that will shape your strategic direction.</p>
