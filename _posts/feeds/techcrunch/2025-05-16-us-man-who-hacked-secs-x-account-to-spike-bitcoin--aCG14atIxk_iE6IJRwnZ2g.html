<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The U.S. Department of Justice announced the sentencing in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/alabama-man-sentenced-14-months-connection-securities-and-exchange-commission-x-hack-spiked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a>. Council and other hackers took over the SEC&#8217;s X account in 2024 to falsely announce that the agency had approved Bitcoin exchange traded funds, or ETFs, which shot up the price of the cryptocurrency before later dropping.</p>
