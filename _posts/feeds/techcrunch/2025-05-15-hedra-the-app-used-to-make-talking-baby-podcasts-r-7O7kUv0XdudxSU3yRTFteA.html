<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">People are using AI video generation tools to contribute to an unexpected new viral trend: podcasts featuring <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/ChrisJBakke/status/1922109990002737453">AI-generated</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yAn5HKUJELM">talking</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/ChrisJBakke/status/1922109990002737453">babies</a>. And one of the companies helping artists do this is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/hedra_labs/status/1922366273050005591">Hedra</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The startup, launched in 2023, offers a web-based video generation and editing suite powered by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/hedra_labs/status/1922366273050005591">its Character-3 model</a>, which lets users make videos with an AI-generated character as the focus, as well as transfer styles across images and audio. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This is what people are using to make podcast videos like <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/minchoi/status/1915250981463326902">this one</a>, in which an AI-generated dog talks about what it&#8217;s like to live with a new baby in the house.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">We&#8217;re not sure how much Hedra has benefited from this trend, but it&#8217;s receiving ample investor attention nevertheless: the company on Thursday said it has raised $32 million in a Series A funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s Infrastructure fund. Its previous investors are participating in the round, and a16z&#8217;s Matt Bornstein will join the startup&#8217;s board.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Michael Lingelbach, the company&#8217;s founder and CEO (pictured below), told TechCrunch the startup was inspired by the gap he noticed between companies like Synthesia, which let users superimpose AI-generated avatars over presentations, and startups like Runway, which provide video generation tools for creating short clips. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;I thought what if we did something at the intersection of video generation and 3D characters, with long dialogues and better controllability,&#8221; he said.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Hedra launched its first video model in June 2024, and quickly attracted investor interest, securing $10 million in seed funding from Index Ventures, Abstract Ventures, and a16z speedrun. Earlier this year, Amazon also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/26/amazon-alexa-fund-invests-into-four-new-startups-as-it-plans-to-invest-more-into-ai-solutions/">backed the company</a> through its venture capital arm, Alexa Fund.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Lingelbach noted that the launch of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/hedra_labs/status/1897699010632466469">the Character-3 model in March was a big inflection point</a> (shortly after the company signed its term sheet with a16z), and is now driving a lot of user growth.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The startup wants to use fresh cash to train its next model, which it says enables better customization, as well as develop technology to let its AI-generated characters interact with users.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company is now focusing on attracting creators and prosumers, and said it has received inbound interest from marketing departments of enterprises as well.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While Hedra&#8217;s own model is centered around character movement and expression, the app lets you employ other models like Veo 2 and Kling for video generation; Flux, Imagen3, Sana, and Ideogram V2 for image generation; and audio models from ElevenLabs and Cartesia for voice generation or cloning.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Hedra&#8217;s competitors include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/26/video-editing-app-captions-releases-a-new-ai-edit-feature-that-automatically-adds-effects-to-your-video/">Captions</a> (also backed by a16z), which is focused more on smartphones; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/28/ai-animation-startup-cheehoo-lands-10m-funding-from-greycroft/">Greycroft-backed Cheehoo</a>, which works with Hollywood studios to create animated features; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/synthesia-snaps-up-180m-on-a-2-1b-valuation-for-its-b2b-ai-video-platform/">Synthesia</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.heygen.com/blog/announcing-our-series-a">HeyGen</a>. Hedra claims the videos generated with its platform have more expressive characters than those made using its competition.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">a16z&#8217;s Bornstein thinks that as the AI-powered video generation space evolves, we will see more tools focusing on characters, motion, voice, editing and the like.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;AI companies can produce amazing clips of environments and simple actions. But they can&#8217;t generate meaningful dialogue or animation.&#160;It&#8217;s not just about making a video, it&#8217;s about making a story that resonates. This is largely down to the people and characters in the story.&#160;That&#8217;s exactly what Hedra is building,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in an emailed statement.</p>
