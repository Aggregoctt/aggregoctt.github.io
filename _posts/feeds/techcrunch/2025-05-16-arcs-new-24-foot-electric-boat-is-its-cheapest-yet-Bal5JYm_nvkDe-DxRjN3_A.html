<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Electric boat startup Arc has a new model that is its cheapest and most approachable watercraft yet.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The new boat is called the Arc Coast, and it will start at $168,000. The company is taking preorders now and says the Coast will ship in 2026.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Coast is what&#8217;s known as a &#8220;center console&#8221; boat, which is often used for fishing. It&#8217;s the company&#8217;s third model, following the limited edition $300,000 Arc One and the $268,000 Arc Sport (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/11/i-got-soaked-driving-the-arc-sport-electric-boat/">I got to pilot earlier this year</a>). That&#8217;s despite <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598790/arc-one-electric-boat-photos-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">coming out of stealth just four years ago</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Arc also recently announced it&#8217;s working on an electric <a href="https://arcboats.com/blog/arc-electric-tugboat-diversified-marine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tug boat</a> to be used at the Port of Los Angeles, as the startup tries to make good on founder and CEO Mitch Lee&#8217;s ambitious promise to electrify all watercraft.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company says the Coast is powered by the same 226kWh battery pack Arc designed for the Sport and is roughly the same size. That battery should last for hours &#8212; four to five, or even more, depending on how much drivers use the 400 horsepower on offer &#8212; and power the Coast up to around 50 miles per hour. Up to ten people can ride on board.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The big difference between the Coast and the Sport, other than price, is the layout. True to its name, the &#8220;console&#8221; or helm of the boat is situated in the center, allowing for freer movement around the edges. It appears to have the same fit and finish of Arc&#8217;s other boats, which looked superb even on the production-intent Sport I drove in January. Arc has also put a lot of work into the software on the center console&#8217;s screens, which are minimalist yet rich with information.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Add in all the other upsides over gas boats like no fumes, no winterization, and less noise, and it&#8217;s possible to imagine people justifying what is still an eye-watering price tag when it hits the market next year.</p>
