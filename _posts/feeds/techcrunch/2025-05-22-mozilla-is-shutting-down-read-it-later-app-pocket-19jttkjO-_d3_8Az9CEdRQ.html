<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Mozilla <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/building-whats-next/?_gl=1*1d3eiwu*_ga*NjExMzU2NTkxLjE3NDc5MzU1NTc.*_ga_2VC139B3XV*czE3NDc5MzU1NTckbzEkZzAkdDE3NDc5MzU1NTckajAkbDAkaDA." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> on Thursday that it&#8217;s shutting down Pocket, a read-it-later app it acquired in 2017, on July 8. The company is also shutting down Fakespot, its browser extension that helps users identify unreliable reviews. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Pocket has helped millions save articles and discover stories worth reading,&#8221; Mozilla said in a blog post. &#8220;But the way people use the web has evolved, so we&#8217;re channeling our resources into projects that better match their browsing habits and online needs.&#8221;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Users will be able to continue using the app and browser extensions for Pocket until July 8. After that date, Pocket will move into export-only mode. Users have until October 8 to export saved articles, including items in their list, archive, favorites, notes, and highlights. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While Mozilla did not provide a specific reason for shutting down the service, the company says it will continue to invest in helping people discover and &#8220;access high quality web content.&#8221; Mozilla says it will do this through its <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-new-tab-page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">New Tab</a> experience, email newsletter, and more. The New Tab experience features shortcuts to your most visited sites, your recently visited pages, and your bookmarks. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As for Fakespot, Mozilla says it&#8217;s shutting down the service because &#8220;while the idea resonated, it didn&#8217;t fit a model we could sustain.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Although it&#8217;s unclear how many users Pocket had, the service was able to cultivate a loyal userbase over the years. Users <a href="https://x.com/byFcz/status/1925603155355554053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">have taken</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=3011040&amp;action=edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a> to voice their displeasure with the news. </p>
