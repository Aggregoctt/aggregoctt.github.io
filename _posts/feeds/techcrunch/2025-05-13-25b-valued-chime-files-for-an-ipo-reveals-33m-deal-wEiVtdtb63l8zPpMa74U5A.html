<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">At long last, digital consumer bank Chime has moved forward with its IPO by filing its S-1 paperwork Tuesday. Chime had reportedly filed confidential S-1 paperwork <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/19/25-billion-valuation-chime-takes-another-step-towards-an-ipo/">back in December.</a></p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">S-1 filings typically reveal all kinds of information, covering financial, legal, and other risk factors. But <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1795586/000162828025025059/chimefinancialinc-sx1wq1da.htm#i363b0c624ed44c8e9fc3fbf2adbc5c35_874">Chime&#8217;s S-1 documents</a> still have a lot of blank spaces. We don&#8217;t know how many shares it hopes to sell or at what price. Chime could be aiming to raise $1 billion, IPO specialist Renaissance Capital <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/IPOtweet/status/1922400017291083880">believes</a>.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">We also don&#8217;t know how many shares insiders plan to sell as part of the IPO. This includes its major backers, a list that includes billionaire Yuri Milner&#8217;s DST Global, Michael Stark&#8217;s Crosslink Capital, billionaire Len Blavatnik&#8217;s Access Industries as well as VC firms General Atlantic, Menlo Venture (led by board member&#160;Shawn Carolan), the Sino French Innovation Fund, and Iconiq Strategic Partners, according to the paperwork.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Chime raised $2.65 billion total as a private company, including its last raise in 2021 that valued it at $25 billion,  PitchBook estimates. As a result, there are many more VCs on its cap table. They, too, could be in for big paydays. For instance, Kirsten Green&#8217;s Forerunner Ventures and Hunter Walk&#8217;s Homebrew both claim Chime as a portfolio company.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Chime offered one detail that suggests the company believes it will be a huge IPO. Chime enlisted an army of big name investment bankers, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The financials show why investors may grow excited. The company finished 2024 with $1.67 billion in revenue and $25 million in losses, compared to nearly $1.3 billion in revenue and $203 million of losses in 2023. Its 2025 first quarter revenue was already $519 million. So, by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/pitdesi/status/1922389449767305429">Silicon Valley math</a>, that puts it on track for $2 billion this year and near profitability.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Chime offers consumer checking, savings, debit, and credit cards and claims 8.6 million active users.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">One interesting reveal in the paperwork. Its board member Cynthia Marshall served as the CEO of the Dallas Mavericks from 2018 to December 2024. Chime became a Mavericks sponsor during that time. It paid around $33 million over three years (2022-2024), which gained it the Chime logo on the team&#8217;s jersey, among other marketing benefits. Without that deal, it might have already been profitable.</p>
