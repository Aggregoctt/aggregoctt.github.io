<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?</h4>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?</h4>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they&#8217;ll give canned responses to questions.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Can ChatGPT write essays?</h4>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Yes.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Can ChatGPT commit libel?</h4>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/03/the-great-pretender/">Due to the nature of how these models work</a>, they don&#8217;t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That&#8217;s a problem when you&#8217;re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn&#8217;t commit, that may well at this point be libel.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">We will see how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/06/can-ai-commit-libel-were-about-to-find-out/">handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT</a> will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Does ChatGPT have an app?</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Yes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/20/chatgpts-mobile-app-revenue-saw-biggest-spike-yet-following-gpt-4o-launch/">there is a free ChatGPT mobile app</a> for iOS and Android users.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is the ChatGPT character limit?</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It&#8217;s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Does ChatGPT have an API?</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Yes, it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/01/openai-launches-an-api-for-chatgpt-plus-dedicated-capacity-for-enterprise-customers/">released</a> March 1, 2023.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How good is ChatGPT at writing code?</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can&#8217;t necessarily program an entire app&#8217;s worth of code. That&#8217;s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness &#8212; in other words, the generated code isn&#8217;t always appropriate for the specific context in which it&#8217;s being used.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Can you save a ChatGPT chat?</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Yes.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">OpenAI has&#160;said&#160;that individuals in &#8220;certain jurisdictions&#8221; (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out&#160;<a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this form</a>. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression &#8220;in accordance with applicable laws&#8221;.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled &#8220;<a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request</a>&#8221;.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on &#8220;legitimate interest&#8221; (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out &#8212; when it writes: &#8220;See <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&#160;for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.&#8221;</p>

This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Futurism reported</a> the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI.

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Several major school systems and colleges, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/05/as-nyc-public-schools-block-chatgpt-openai-says-its-working-on-mitigations-to-help-spot-chatgpt-generated-text/">including New York City Public Schools</a>, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices.

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/openai-releases-tool-to-detect-ai-generated-text-including-from-chatgpt/">tests</a>, they&#8217;re inconsistent at best.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are ChatGPT chats public?</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">No. But OpenAI <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23649806/chatgpt-chat-histories-bug-exposed-disabled-outage" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently</a> disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users&#8217; conversations to other people on the service.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/28/23575919/microsoft-openai-github-dismiss-copilot-ai-copyright-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">involved</a> in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.</p>
