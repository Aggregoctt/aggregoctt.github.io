<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Former Siri head John Giannandrea pushed Apple to choose Google&#8217;s Gemini chatbot over ChatGPT for the first chatbot integration with Siri last year, according to a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-18/how-apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai-went-so-wrong">Bloomberg</a> report looking at Apple&#8217;s uneven AI efforts.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Giannandrea, an ex-Google executive who was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/20/apple-puts-vision-pro-exec-in-charge-of-siri-in-exec-shakeup/">demoted in a leadership reshuffle in March</a>, thought that OpenAI&#8217;s bot wouldn&#8217;t have staying power and wasn&#8217;t protective of sensitive personal data. Despite these concerns, Apple announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-brings-chatgpt-to-its-apps-including-siri/">ChatGPT&#8217;s integration at WWDC in 2025</a> and made the feature available to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-new-apple-intelligence-features-including-chatgpt-integration-with-ios-18-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">users in December</a>. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Apple&#8217;s integration lets users tap ChatGPT in instances where Siri isn&#8217;t able to answer a question. Last year, Apple announced that it would connect additional chatbots, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-confirms-plans-to-work-with-googles-gemini-in-the-future/">including Google&#8217;s Gemini</a>, to Siri. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Apple is also in preliminary talks with AI-powered search engine Perplexity to offer Perplexity as a ChatGPT alternative in Siri and a search provider in the company&#8217;s Safari browser, according to Bloomberg.</p>
