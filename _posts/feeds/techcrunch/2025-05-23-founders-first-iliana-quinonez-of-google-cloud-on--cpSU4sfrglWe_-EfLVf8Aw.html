<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-scaling-ai-startups-quinonez-s-tactical-approach">Scaling AI startups: Quinonez&#8217;s tactical approach</h2>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Quinonez leads a technical team that partners with high-potential startups across the U.S. and Canada, offering hands-on support as they integrate <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Cloud</a> and AI tools from pre-seed through IPO. Her approach is deeply technical and grounded in the realities of startup velocity &#8212; she knows time, capital, and clarity are in short supply &#8212; and she helps founders maximize all three.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Startups building with AI agents today face a layered set of questions. What&#8217;s the right architecture for scaling intelligent behavior? How do you structure data pipelines to train agents that don&#8217;t just react but reason? Where do APIs end and core IP begin? Quinonez will tackle these questions head-on in a session designed to help founders cut through noise and make defensible decisions about infrastructure, model orchestration, and collaboration.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">What sets Quinonez apart is her range. With over two decades of leadership experience at Salesforce, SAP, and BEA Systems, she&#8217;s helped both enterprise giants and early-stage startups map product ambition to practical execution. Her team also partners closely with accelerators, VCs, and developer ecosystems &#8212; giving her a panoramic view of what&#8217;s working in AI&#160;&#8230; and what&#8217;s not.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Expect a clear-eyed discussion on the risks and rewards of building with AI agents, the tools startups are relying on, and what it really takes to democratize access to advanced machine learning &#8212; without compromising on speed or security.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-get-the-edge-low-rate-locked-ai-wisdom-unlocked"><strong>Get the edge: Low rate locked, AI wisdom unlocked</strong></h2>
