<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">SoundCloud says it&#8217;s revising its terms after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/09/soundcloud-changes-policies-to-allow-ai-training-on-user-content/">widespread backlash</a> over a clause related to AI model training. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Earlier this year, SoundCloud quietly updated its&#160;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/terms-of-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">usage policies</a>, adding wording that many users interpreted as legal cover to allow the company to train AI on audio uploaded to its platform. SoundCloud was quick to assert that it wasn&#8217;t developing AI by using its users&#8217; content, but the company&#8217;s PR statement didn&#8217;t allay fears that SoundCloud might do so in the future.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">On Wednesday, SoundCloud CEO Eliah Seton <a href="https://musically.com/2025/05/14/soundcloud-changes-terms-of-use-to-reflect-its-ai-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published</a> an <a href="https://press.soundcloud.com/249951-a-letter-from-our-ceo-clarifying-our-terms-of-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">open letter</a> admitting that the wording of the changes to the company&#8217;s terms &#8220;was too broad and wasn&#8217;t clear enough.&#8221; The updates were intended to focus on other uses of AI internally at the company, Seton said &#8212; including recommendations and tools to help prevent fraud &#8212; but missed the mark.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">SoundCloud has now revised its terms &#8220;to make it absolutely clear [that] SoundCloud will not use [user] content to train generative AI models that aim to replicate or synthesize [a] voice, music, or likeness,&#8221; said Seton.</p>
