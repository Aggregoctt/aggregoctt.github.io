<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Apple Music is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/universal-music-group-and-apple-music-announce-sound-therapy/">introducing</a> a new &#8220;audio wellness&#8221; collection of songs called Sound Therapy. Designed in partnership with Universal Music Group (UMG), the feature combines songs that subscribers already know with other sound waves that promote focusing, relaxing, or sleeping.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Songs may include auditory beats or colored noise, sound waves where the intensity varies at different frequencies that are categorized by colors. For instance, pink noise &#8212; a variation akin to rain or wind &#8212; can be combined with delta waves to promote sleep.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Focus category in Sound Therapy, meanwhile, leverages gamma auditory beats combined with white noise. And songs in the Relax group use theta auditory beats to promote winding down and letting go. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The collection features songs that listeners already know, like those from artists such as Imagine Dragons, Katy Perry, Kacey Musgraves, Ludovico Einaudi, AURORA, Jhen&#233; Aiko, Chelsea Cutler, and Jeremy Zucker. These tracks were turned into extended, instrumental versions by producers and audio engineers at UMG&#8217;s music wellness venture called Sollos, based in London. </p>
