<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Affiniti founders Aaron Bai, 20, and Sahil Phadnis, 22, are building the kind of expense management software for main street small businesses that tech startups have enjoyed for years.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Their growth has been so impressive that six months after raising an $11 million seed round, they raised a $17 million Series A, led by Signal Fire, they told TechCrunch exclusively.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://affiniti.finance/">Affiniti</a> offers SMBs like pharmacies, HVAC companies, and auto dealerships customizable expense management credit cards and software similar to the kind of wares pioneered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/25/brex-eyes-500m-in-revenue-as-it-adds-the-likes-of-anthropic-and-robinhood-as-customers/">by Brex</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/12/congressman-is-investigating-fintech-ramps-attempt-to-win-25m-federal-contract/">Ramp.</a></p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But traditional small businesses already have credit card options galore from the likes of American Express and Capital One as well as traditional banks. Why would they choose Affiniti?</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Because, Bai says, the startup is offering what he calls &#8220;v3&#8221; of fintech. In his view, v.1 is traditional banks and credit cards. Brex and Ramp represent v2, which brought improved UX design and better access to the financial data generated by expenses.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;V3, in our opinion, is a fintech product that can actually advise the end users and give them analytics,&#8221; Bai says. &#8220;These traditional small businesses don&#8217;t have a finance team.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Series A cash will help the startup launch features like banking, bill pay, cash flow analytics, and integrations with more software like enterprise resource planning and point-of-sale apps.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Currently it offers features like customized&#160;cash-back rewards, native Quickbooks &#8220;qbo&#8221; files &#8212; not just CSV files &#8212; and short-term loans, up to 90 days, against invoices.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Interestingly, unlike so many founders in their 20s, Affiniti didn&#8217;t come from a startup school like Y Combinator. They didn&#8217;t have to, the founders said. They met while attending UC Berkeley, which helped them form a solid network in Silicon Valley for introductions to VCs and others. And they also came up with a marketing move on their own, partnering with specific industry trade groups, like ones for independent pharmacies, they said.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This not only helped validate the startup to potential customers, but gave them immediate access to features like group purchasing discounts. &#8220;We&#8217;re actually not trying to boil the ocean when it comes to working with every SMB in America,&#8221; Phadnis said. &#8220;We&#8217;re selecting a couple niche verticals with complex cash flow.&#8221;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">All of this worked well enough for Affiniti to go, in its first 14 months, from zero to 1,800 customers and about $20 million a month in transaction volume, Phadnis said. The founders think the platform is on track to $1 billion worth of transactions by the end of the year.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As the startup earns most of its money on transaction interchange fees &#8212; although it also sells SaaS software, and earns interest income on those short-term loans &#8212; this has meant rapid revenue growth.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While the founders wouldn&#8217;t reveal their current revenue, Phadnis offered a you-do-the-math hint: Revenue grew around 10x in a year. &#8220;12 months ago, we were at a million dollars. So 10x is a lot,&#8221; he said, smiling.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Other investors in the Series A include Codie Sanchez&#8217;s Contrarian Thinking Capital, Yahya Mokhtarzada (founder of TrueBill), and Austin Rief (founder of Morning Brew), the startup says.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Seed investors Indicator Ventures, Lightshed Ventures, and RiverPark Ventures also participated. Affiniti had also previously signed a $15 million debt facility, capable of growing to $50 million, with its earlier seed round, it said.</p>
