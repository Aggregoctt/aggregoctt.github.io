<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">At the Android Show, ahead of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/09/google-i-o-2025-what-to-expect-including-updates-to-gemini-and-android-16/">Google I/O 2025</a>, Google announced that it is adding new device-specific features to its Advanced Protection program, which is designed to protect public figures such as politicians or journalists from different digital threats, with the Android 16 release. The new features include a new way of storing device logs that are accessible only by the user, protection from spam calls, and an auto-restart feature for when the device is locked for a certain amount of time. These features are aimed at adding an extra layer of security for public figures and preventing their devices from being compromised.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">With the Android 16 release, the company is adding an intrusion logging feature for threat analysis. This feature stores your device logs with end-to-end encryption in the cloud. If there is suspicion around the device being compromised, these logs can be used to perform analysis.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company is also adding USB protection to allow only charging from a new USB connection while the device is locked.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google said devices under the Advanced Protection program will also automatically restart after 72 hours if the device is locked. TechCrunch reported last month that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/for-security-android-phones-will-now-auto-reboot-after-three-days/">the feature was mentioned in the Google Play services update</a>. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">What&#8217;s more, if you have advanced protection enabled, with Android 16, the system will prevent you from automatically reconnecting to Wi-Fi networks that are not secure. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The program is also gaining a feature to privately process conversations on the device to try and detect a potential scam for an ongoing phone call. The company launched this feature for Pixel phones earlier this year. </p>
