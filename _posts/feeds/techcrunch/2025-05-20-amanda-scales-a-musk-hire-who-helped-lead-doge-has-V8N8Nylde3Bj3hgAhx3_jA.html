<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Amanda Scales, the former xAI HR exec who helped lead billionaire Elon Musk&#8217;s Department of Government Efficiency initiative while working at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, recently returned to xAI, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-political-spending.html">according to The New York Times</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Scales used to work on talent acquisition at xAI. Since April, she&#8217;s worked on the talent side of the company once again, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandascales/">per her LinkedIn profile</a>. Previously, Scales was in human resources and talent at San Francisco-based VC firm Human Capital, as well as at Uber.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Scales&#8217; return to xAI comes as Musk has indicated that he plans to pull back from DOGE. The tech billionaire has made himself increasingly scarce in Washington, according to the Times. Last month, Musk told Wall Street analysts that he planned to spend less time on politics and more on his companies like Tesla.</p>
