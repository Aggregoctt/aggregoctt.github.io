<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">The morning after Elon Musk&#8217;s 2022 acquisition of Twitter (now X), reporters encountered two men with boxes outside the company&#8217;s headquarters. One introduced himself as recently laid-off Twitter engineer &#8220;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428775/twitter-fake-employee-layoff-rahul-ligma-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rahul Ligma</a>.&#8221;&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">His real name is Rahul Sonwalkar but the prank went viral. He piled on his character&#8217;s notoriety when he went to the Bahamas to <a href="https://x.com/WSBChairman/status/1590799621378691072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">play a laid-off FTX worker</a> right after that cryptocurrency exchange imploded.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While he never worked for X or FTX, he is actually very much a techy. He spent several years working as an engineer at Uber.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">He&#160;even went through Y Combinator at that time, working on a logistics startup that he later scrapped <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/julius" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">before pivoting</a>.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The now 27-year-old wants to draw attention to his more serious endeavor: Julius, the AI data analyst startup he founded about two years ago.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The tool, which can analyze and visualize extensive datasets and perform predictive modeling from natural language prompts, has attracted over 2 million registered users.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;I wanted to build something that would make data science very accessible to everyone,&#8221; Sonwalkar told TechCrunch.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While some of Julius&#8217; functionality is also available on ChatGPT, Anthropic&#8217;s Claude, and Google&#8217;s Gemini, Iavor Bojinov, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School (HBS), liked the tool so much that he had to convince Sonwalkar to modify Julius specifically for HBS&#8217; new required course called <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/news/articles/Pages/mba-ai-course.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Data Science and AI for Leaders</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#160;&#8220;We had done a head-to-head comparison across a number of platforms, including ChatGPT, and Julius ended up performing the best,&#8221; Bojinov told TechCrunch.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The adoption by HBS, an educational institution that breeds about <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/mba/admissions/class-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">1,000 future business leaders annually</a>, is clearly a big win for Julius, which is currently a team of 12 employees.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Sonwalkar has also raised a seed round led by Bessemer Venture Partners&#8217; Talia Goldberg, TechCrunch learned from someone familiar with the deal. But Sonwalkar wouldn&#8217;t discuss the details.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bessemer didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Did Sonwalkar&#8217;s &#8220;Rahul Ligma&#8221; stunts open doors when he was first building Julius?</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#160;&#8220;A little bit in the early days, but to be honest, not as much recently,&#8221; he said.</p>
