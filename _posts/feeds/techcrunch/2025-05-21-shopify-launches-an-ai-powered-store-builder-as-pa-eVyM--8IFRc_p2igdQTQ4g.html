<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Shopify is giving its merchants a slew of new AI-powered tools designed to help them enhance the online shopping experience for their customers. This includes an AI store builder for users to set up storefronts using a single prompt, as well as an AI generator for creating elements (such as banners) without knowing how to code.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The platform also upgraded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/26/shopify-sidekick-is-like-chatgpt-but-for-ecommerce-merchants/">Sidekick</a>, its AI commerce assistant, with new voice chat and screen sharing capabilities.&#160;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">These updates were announced on Wednesday during Shopify&#8217;s Edition launch day, the company&#8217;s biannual announcement that showcases recent changes to the platform.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The goal of the AI store builder is to create the foundation of a website quickly, so there&#8217;s more time for personalization. To use the tool, users first have to enter a prompt that describes their brand. For example, &#8220;tennis gear and stylish athleisure.&#8221; Shopify&#8217;s AI then generates a ready-to-launch storefront, and merchants can then manually customize their store within the editor.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Shopify also introduced a new public theme called &#8220;Horizon&#8221; in its Theme Store, a marketplace for downloading pre-designed templates.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Horizon includes a built-in AI to assist merchants in adjusting their designs as they wish. It&#8217;s also the first theme to include &#8220;Theme Blocks,&#8221; which are essentially building blocks that merchants can use to customize how their online store looks without touching any code.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">These theme blocks can also be further customized with the help of AI. For example, if the merchant wants a banner with text and an animation, they can describe it or share an image for inspiration, and it generates the code for them to copy into the editor. They can also generate images.&#160;</p>
 

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Additionally, users can now engage in voice chat with Sidekick, which responds audibly to questions. For example, if merchants are confused about tariffs&#8212;a hot topic for retailers right now&#8212;Sidekick will direct them to a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://tariffguide.ai/">tariff guide</a> that provides U.S. rates for different types of products. Users can also screen share with Sidekick to navigate features, such as finding the settings.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Alongside these new capabilities, Sidekick is now available in the Shopify mobile app.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Sidekick was rolled out widely to all merchants in December 2024. According to the company, monthly users have more than doubled since the beginning of 2025, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
