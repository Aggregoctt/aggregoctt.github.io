<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Microsoft on Monday became one of the first hyperscalers to provide managed access to Grok, the AI model developed by billionaire Elon Musk&#8217;s AI startup, xAI. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Available through Microsoft&#8217;s Azure AI Foundry platform, Grok &#8212; specifically <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/elon-musks-ai-company-xai-launches-an-api-for-grok-3/">Grok 3 and Grok 3 mini</a> &#8212; will &#8220;have all the service-level agreements&#160;Azure customers expect from any Microsoft product,&#8221; says Microsoft. They&#8217;ll also be billed directly by Microsoft, as is the case with the other models hosted in Azure AI Foundry.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">When Musk announced Grok several years ago, he pitched the AI model as edgy, unfiltered, and anti-&#8220;woke&#8221; &#8212; in general, willing to answer controversial questions other AI systems simply won&#8217;t. He delivered on some of that promise. Told to be vulgar, for example, Grok will happily oblige, spewing colorful language you likely wouldn&#8217;t hear from&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/22/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/">ChatGPT</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">According to SpeechMach, a benchmark comparing how different models treat sensitive subjects, Grok 3 is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/theres-now-a-benchmark-for-how-free-an-ai-chatbot-is-to-talk-about-controversial-topics/">among the more permissive models</a>. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Grok, which powers a number of features on X, Musk&#8217;s social network, has been the subject of much controversy lately. <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/gross-elon-musks-grok-ai-will-undress-photos-of-women-on-x-if-you-ask" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A recent report</a>&#160;found that Grok would undress photos of women when asked. In February, Grok&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/23/grok-3-appears-to-have-briefly-censored-unflattering-mentions-of-trump-and-musk/">briefly censored</a>&#160;unflattering mentions of Donald Trump and Musk. And just last week, an &#8220;unauthorized modification&#8221; caused Grok to&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/grok-is-unpromptedly-telling-x-users-about-south-african-genocide/">repeatedly refer</a> to&#160;white genocide in South Africa when invoked in certain contexts. </p>
