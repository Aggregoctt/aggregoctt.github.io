<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Google says it will commit up to $150 million to the consumer eyewear company Warby Parker to jointly develop AI-powered smart glasses based on Android XR, the companies said on Tuesday during Google I/O 2025.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google has already committed $75 million to Warby Parker&#8217;s product development and commercialization costs, the companies said in a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://investors.warbyparker.com/news/news-details/2025/Warby-Parker-Partners-with-Google-To-Develop-Intelligent-Eyewear/default.aspx">press release</a>. Google says it will invest an additional $75 million, taking an equity stake in Warby Parker, should the eyewear manufacturer meet certain milestones.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At Google I/O 2025, Google also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/google-shows-off-android-xr-based-glasses-announces-warby-parker-team-up/">announced partnerships with several companies</a> to develop smart glasses with Gemini AI and AR capabilities, including Samsung and Gentle Monster.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google seems to be taking a page out of Meta&#8217;s smart glasses strategy. Meta has found success partnering and investing in the Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica to develop its smart glasses. Part of the reason behind Ray-Ban Meta&#8217;s success is that the smart glasses have an attractive, familiar design and they&#8217;re being sold in Ray-Ban stores. It seems likely that Google will have a similar relationship with Warby Parker, taking advantage of the eyewear company&#8217;s popular frame designs and perhaps its retail stores.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In the press release, Warby Parker and Google said they intend to launch a series of products over time. Their first line of eyewear will launch &#8220;after 2025&#8221; and will incorporate multimodal AI with prescription and non-prescription glasses.</p>
