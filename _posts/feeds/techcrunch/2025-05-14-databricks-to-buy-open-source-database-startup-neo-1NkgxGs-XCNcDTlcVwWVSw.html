<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Data analytics platform <a href="https://www.databricks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Databricks</a> said on Wednesday that it has agreed to acquire <a rel="nofollow" href="https://neon.tech/">Neon</a>, a startup building an open source alternative to AWS Aurora Postgres, for about $1 billion. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Databricks said acquiring Neon&#8217;s tech would let it combine the startup&#8217;s serverless relational database management system with its own data intelligence services to let its customers deploy AI agents more efficiently. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Founded in 2021 by CEO Nikita Shamgunov and software engineers Heikki Linnakangas and Stas Kelvich, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/07/database-startup-neon-nabs-a-microsoft-investment/">Neon offers a managed cloud-based database platform</a> (with free and usage-based paid plans) that lets developers clone databases and preview changes before they go to production. The platform automatically scales processor, memory and storage according to usage, and supports branching&#160;&#8212; isolated database instances for testing and development &#8212; as well as point-in-time recovery.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Those capabilities, Databricks says, are ideally suited to workloads run by AI agents, which operate faster than human developers but often require supervision to control for errors. Citing recent telemetry, the company said 80% of the databases &#8220;provisioned on Neon were created automatically by AI agents rather than by humans.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;The era of AI-native, agent-driven applications is reshaping what a database must do,&#8221; said Ali Ghodsi, co-founder and CEO of Databricks, in a statement. &#8220;Neon proves it: four out of every five databases on their platform are spun up by code, not humans. By bringing Neon into Databricks, we&#8217;re giving developers a serverless Postgres that can keep up with agentic speed, pay-as-you-go economics and the openness of the Postgres community.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Neon has so far raised $129.5 million, according to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/neondatabase">Crunchbase</a>, and its investors include Microsoft&#8217;s venture arm M12, General Catalyst, Menlo Ventures, and Notable Capital. Databricks, for its part, has so far accumulated more than $19 billion in financing, and in January <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/22/databricks-closes-15-3b-financing-at-62b-valuation-meta-joins-as-strategic-investor/">closed a $15.3 billion financing at a $62 billion valuation</a>.</p>
