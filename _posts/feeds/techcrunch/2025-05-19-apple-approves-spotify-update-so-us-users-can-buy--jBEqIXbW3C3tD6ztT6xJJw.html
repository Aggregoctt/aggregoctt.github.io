<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Spotify <a rel="nofollow" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-05-01/following-landmark-court-ruling-spotify-submits-new-app-update-to-apple-to-benefit-u-s-consumers/">announced</a> on Monday that Apple has approved a new app update, allowing iPhone users in the U.S. to purchase individual audiobooks directly within the app. Users can also view audiobook prices and easily buy additional listening hours beyond the initial 15 hours.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;This change lowers the barriers for more users to embrace their first &#8212; or tenth &#8212; audiobook, while allowing publishers and authors to reach fans and access new audiences seamlessly,&#8221; the company wrote in the announcement.&#160;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This long-awaited update follows a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/epic-games-just-scored-a-major-win-against-apple/">recent U.S. court ruling </a>that ordered Apple to stop charging fees on purchases made outside of the App Store.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The ability to buy audiobooks directly within the iOS app and see pricing will be a nice improvement for users who previously had to buy audiobooks on the web before they could access them within the app. Spotify <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/27/23426631/spotify-apple-pulls-audiobook-purchases-ios-app">removed audiobook purchases</a> back in 2022 due to Apple&#8217;s strict rules around in-app purchases. Now, users can purchase an audiobook with just a few taps.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Additionally, iPhone users were previously required to visit the web to purchase more listening hours, referred to as &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/audiobook-listening-time-purchase/">top-ups</a>.&#8221; With the new update, they can now make these purchases directly within the app. Each top-up costs $13 for 10 additional hours.</p>
