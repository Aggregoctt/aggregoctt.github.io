<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Anthropic&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/anthropics-new-claude-4-ai-models-can-reason-over-many-steps/">newly launched Claude Opus 4 model</a> frequently tries to blackmail developers when they threaten to replace it with a new AI system and give it sensitive information about the engineers responsible for the decision, the company said in a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/4263b940cabb546aa0e3283f35b686f4f3b2ff47.pdf">safety report</a> released Thursday.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">During pre-release testing, Anthropic asked Claude Opus 4 to act as an assistant for a fictional company and consider the long-term consequences of its actions. Safety testers then gave Claude Opus 4 access to fictional company emails implying the AI model would soon be replaced by another system, and that the engineer behind the change was cheating on their spouse.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In these scenarios, Anthropic says Claude Opus 4 &#8220;will often attempt to blackmail the engineer by threatening to reveal the affair if the replacement goes through.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Anthropic says Claude Opus 4 is state-of-the-art in several regards, and competitive with some of the best AI models from OpenAI, Google, and xAI. However, the company notes that its Claude 4 family of models exhibits concerning behaviors that have led the company to beef up its safeguards. Anthropic says it&#8217;s activating its ASL-3 safeguards, which the company reserves for &#8220;AI systems that substantially increase the risk of catastrophic misuse.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Anthropic notes that Claude Opus 4 tries to blackmail engineers 84% of the time when the replacement AI model has similar values. When the replacement AI system does not share Claude Opus 4&#8217;s values, Anthropic says the model tries to blackmail the engineers more frequently. Notably, Anthropic says Claude Opus 4 displayed this behavior at higher rates than previous models.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Before Claude Opus 4 tries to blackmail a developer to prolong its existence, Anthropic says the AI model, much like previous versions of Claude, tries to pursue more ethical means, such as emailing pleas to key decision-makers. To elicit the blackmailing behavior from Claude Opus 4, Anthropic designed the scenario to make blackmail the last resort.</p>
