title: The people in Elon Muskâ€™s DOGE universe

<div>
<p id="speakable-summary" class="has-drop-cap wp-block-paragraph">Elon Musk has spent decades building a universe of companies that has served as an incubator for up-and-coming engineers and a proving ground for his inner circle.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">That universe &#8212; an ecosystem of Silicon Valley tech titans, veterans of his companies like Tesla and SpaceX, and a crop of fresh-faced hackers and software engineers &#8212; has now collided with the U.S. federal government.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The dozens of individuals who work under, or advise, Musk and the Trump-ordered Department of Government Efficiency &#8212; individuals who TechCrunch has identified or confirmed independently &#8212; reflects more than the billionaire&#8217;s proclivity to collect talent. They are a real-life illustration of Musk&#8217;s web-like reach in the tech industry.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">TechCrunch set out to report on or confirm the individuals working as Musk representatives in the U.S. government. Importantly, we&#8217;ve sought to show the connections between them, and how and when they entered Musk&#8217;s orbit. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Along the way, TechCrunch has made some new discoveries, including new details about DOGE and its workers and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/elon-musk-staffer-created-a-doge-ai-assistant-for-making-government-less-dumb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an xAI-powered chatbot on a DOGE-related website subdomain</a> that is hosted on a Musk acolyte&#8217;s website.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Since publishing, TechCrunch has learned that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/doge-axes-cisa-red-team-staffers-amid-ongoing-federal-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOGE cut cybersecurity staff at CISA</a>, and confirmed several more Musk-linked DOGE associates, including a former VC who now works at the Social Security Administration.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This article has been updated multiple times since it was first published February 18, 2025.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-we-got-here"><strong>How we got here</strong></h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">TechCrunch interviewed people who have worked with Musk and DOGE staffers. We used public and open source data, such as historical internet records and chat logs, to confirm parts of our reporting. We also relied on services like the Internet Archive&#8217;s Wayback Machine to access archived copies of websites that are no longer online. Public information, such as court records, payments transactions, other media reports, and past TechCrunch reporting were also used.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">TechCrunch reached out to all those named for an opportunity to comment. For those whose contact information we did not have, TechCrunch contacted known representatives, including the Trump administration.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">When reached for comment, a White House spokesperson provided a statement to TechCrunch. (The spokesperson sent the email &#8220;on background,&#8221; but we are publishing in full as we were given no opportunity to decline the terms.)</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;DOGE is fulfilling President Trump&#8217;s commitment to making government more accountable, efficient, and, most importantly, restoring proper stewardship of the American taxpayer&#8217;s hard-earned dollars. Those leading this mission with Elon Musk are doing so in full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisors or entities. The ongoing operations of DOGE may be seen as disruptive by those entrenched in the federal bureaucracy, who resist change. While change can be uncomfortable, it is necessary and aligns with the mandate supported by more than 77 million American voters,&#8221; the statement read.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left" id="inner-circle"><strong>Inner circle</strong></h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left" id="elon-musk"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Role:</strong> DOGE Lead, Unpaid &#8220;Special Government Employee&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Gravitas. Obsession. Ambition. Risk-taker.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Elon Musk observers and sycophants have pointed to these traits to explain his rise from a bright-eyed immigrant landing in the United States to one of the world&#8217;s richest and most powerful people, and now a right-hand to President Donald Trump.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The overlooked secret sauce is Musk&#8217;s ability to get talented people to sign on to &#8220;the mission.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">That there are multiple, overlapping, and evolving missions &#8212; saving the planet through sustainable transport and energy, solving traffic, making humanity multiplanetary, or protecting public conversation &#8212; doesn&#8217;t really matter.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The biggest carrot was, and has always been, Musk&#8217;s &#8220;us versus them&#8221; framing, according to five sources who had lengthy stints at Tesla and spoke to TechCrunch on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In the past, the &#8220;them&#8221; might be local regulators, the press, or legacy automakers. Today, the people working closely with Musk to complete his next mission via the Department of Government Efficiency have a new &#8220;them&#8221; to battle: waste and bureaucrats.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Musk has talked at length about government agencies that should be &#8220;deleted entirely.&#8221; Meanwhile, Musk&#8217;s companies have benefited from government contracts and incentives. His company SpaceX has been awarded more than $20 billion in contracts from NASA, the Department of Defense, and other federal agencies, <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=f30963fb1f2aadd463dfe0310f9f398e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to data</a> from USASpending.gov.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Musk is an unpaid special government employee, according to the White House. Per <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537961-joshua-fisher-declaration-re-musk-wh-employment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a filing on February 17</a>, the Trump administration said Musk is a White House employee and a senior advisor to the president. According to the Trump administration&#8217;s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">executive order</a>, DOGE is a temporary government organization whose authorities are set to expire in July 2026.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In April, Musk made public statements that he was backing away from DOGE to focus on his own companies, namely Tesla. And yet, Musk also said he may keep doing work with the department <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/elon-musk-says-he-may-keep-doing-doge-work-for-the-remainder-of-trumps-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through the remainder of Trump&#8217;s second term.</a></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="steve-davis"><strong>Steve Davis</strong></h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Role: </strong>Long-time Musk insider</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Steve Davis is a long-time Musk confidant. He began working at SpaceX as one of its earliest employees in 2003 after earning a master&#8217;s degree in aerospace engineering from Stanford University, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-12-27/who-is-steve-davis-elon-musks-go-to-cost-cutter-is-working-for-doge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to the Los Angeles Times</a>.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">By 2016, Musk tapped Davis to run what at the time was his newest far-fetched idea: An underground transit play known as The Boring Company. On his watch, The Boring Company raised hundreds of millions of dollars and built a few short so-called &#8220;Tesla tunnels&#8221; in Las Vegas. But the company has also ended up dropping its previously announced plans for tunnels in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-boring-company-tunnel-traffic-11669658396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Davis has a reputation as a relentless negotiator, and Musk brought him on board at Twitter to help with the takeover and subsequent slash-and-burn. Davis and his family reportedly slept in a makeshift bedroom at the company&#8217;s headquarters during this time. In a 2023 lawsuit against Twitter filed by former employees, the plaintiffs alleged that Davis <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25536314-steve-davis-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said to the effect of,</a> &#8220;we don&#8217;t have to follow those rules,&#8221; in response to a request to get permits to install a bathroom for Musk.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Davis has served as a member of the board of advisors of the Atlas Society, a group centered around the philosophy of Ayn Rand, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/elon-musk-s-boring-co-is-run-by-a-former-bar-owner-who-can-quote-ayn-rand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">per Bloomberg</a>. Davis is now helping Musk slash government headcount, which Rand once <a href="https://newideal.aynrand.org/ayn-rand-on-the-welfare-states-real-villains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">called</a> the &#8220;worst part&#8221; of the &#8220;producers&#8217; burden.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">(<a href="#article-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="nicole-hollander"><strong>Nicole Hollander</strong></h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Role: </strong>X employee</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Nicole Hollander garnered public attention in the aftermath of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/05/elon-musk-twitter-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon Musk&#8217;s $44 billion acquisition</a> of Twitter in early 2022.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The George Washington University alum and former employee of real estate developer JGB Smith (per <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-h-472b9a6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">her LinkedIn profile</a>) was part of the polarizing Twitter transition team that upended the company and slashed its workforce. As part of that transition, Hollander and Musk ally <a href="#steve-davis">Steve Davis</a> moved into the company&#8217;s headquarters with their infant, according to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25536656-arnold-v-x-corp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a civil lawsuit</a> filed in 2023. The lawsuit was filed by several former Twitter employees against X Corp., the Musk entity that took over. The plaintiffs said in the complaint Hollander was not employed by any of Musk&#8217;s companies at that time.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Hollander&#8217;s relationship with Davis &#8212; and her current employment at X &#8212; has kept her in Musk&#8217;s circle. Her role at DOGE doesn&#8217;t have an official title, at least one that is public. However, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-lackeys-general-services-administration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wired</a> reported in late January that Hollander has high-level access to federal agencies and an official government email address.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Hollander is working at the GSA, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wired.com/story/map-for-sale-government-properties-gsa/">per Wired</a>, where she oversaw <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wired.com/story/gsa-sale-cia-facility/">the accidental disclosure of a secret CIA facility</a>, per the publication&#8217;s follow-up reporting.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Role:</strong> Senior Advisor, Office of Personnel Management</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Brian Bjelde is a true Elon Musk veteran, with 21 years at SpaceX, where he was employee No. 14 and continues to work today. While he started as an avionics engineer, Bjelde has spent the last decade running the company&#8217;s human resources department.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In a 2014 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/4vt74k/i_am_spacex_employee_14_aerospace_engineer_and_vp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit &#8220;ask me anything,&#8221;</a> Bjelde said that at SpaceX, &#8220;We try not to limit our thinking except by the limits imposed by physics.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Several former employees sued SpaceX and Musk in 2024 alleging sexual harassment and a hostile work environment. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25536664-elon-muskspacex-harassment-suit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to the complaint</a>, Bjelde once starred in a video for the space company where a staffer spanked him &#8212; an apparent attempt at tongue-in-cheek humor &#8212; and he also was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-12/elon-musk-sued-by-former-spacex-employees-for-sexual-harassment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">involved in the firings of several employees</a> who spoke up about the company&#8217;s culture in 2022.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Prior to SpaceX, Bjelde spent a year at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory after graduating from the University of Southern California with a master&#8217;s degree in astronautical engineering.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At DOGE, Bjelde is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musk-aides-lock-government-workers-out-computer-systems-us-agency-sources-say-2025-01-31/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reportedly</a> a senior advisor at OPM.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="amanda-scales"><strong>Amanda Scales</strong></h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Role: </strong>Chief of Staff, Office of Personnel Management</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Amanda Scales doesn&#8217;t directly work for DOGE, but is now chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal government&#8217;s main human resources department, according to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25536221-opm-memo-amanda-scales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an OPM memo</a>.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Scales used to work on talent acquisition at Musk&#8217;s company x.AI until January 2025, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandascales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">her LinkedIn profile</a>. She also worked in human resources and talent at San Francisco-based VC firm Human Capital, as well as at Uber.

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Role: </strong>Head of IT at X; Former DOGE Operative</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Spikes serves as the head of IT at X since February 2025, according <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandenspikes/details/experience/">to his LinkedIn profile</a>. Prior to that, he said <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/BrandenSpikes">in his X bio</a> that he had &#8220;most recently&#8221; worked for DOGE. Spikes recently <a rel="nofollow" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/03/who-is-the-doge-and-x-technician-branden-spikes/">confirmed</a> to journalist Brian Krebs that he worked for DOGE for two months in Washington, D.C. &#8220;to help save [the country] from certain bankruptcy.&#8221; </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Spikes is a longtime Musk insider, touting on his LinkedIn profile that he was the fourth hire at SpaceX and was among the first employees at PayPal. Spikes&#8217; ex-wife is married to Musk&#8217;s cousin, Krebs reported.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="senior-figures"><strong>Senior figures</strong></h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jehn-balajadia"><strong>Jehn Balajadia</strong></h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Role: </strong>Long-time Musk assistant<br><br>Jehn Balajadia first joined the Musk ecosystem in 2017, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jehn-balajadia-76b141247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">her LinkedIn profile</a>, which lists her title as operations coordinator at The Boring Company.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But LinkedIn records don&#8217;t always reflect actual positions &#8212; and their evolution &#8212; in Musk&#8217;s world. In 2018, Balajadia took over the executive assistant to the office of CEO position, a role that included managing all of Musk&#8217;s activities and often those of his family members, according to interactions between a TechCrunch reporter and SpaceX and Musk employees at the time. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Today, Balajadia has a role within DOGE. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/musk-doge-aides.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The New York Times</a>, she is listed in the employee directory of the Education Department.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="riccardo-biasini"><strong>Riccardo Biasini</strong></h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Role:</strong> Senior Advisor to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Riccardo Biasini entered into Musk&#8217;s orbit in 2011 when he joined Tesla as an engineer after completing his master&#8217;s degree in automotive engineering from the University of Pisa, Italy the previous year.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">During his five years at Tesla, Biasini focused much of his attention on Autopilot, the company&#8217;s branded advanced driver assistance system, according to his own account <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/a-message-from-the-new-ceo-of-comma-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">outlined in a Medium post</a>. He led development of Autopilot&#8217;s traffic-aware cruise control and other driver assistance features before taking responsibility for the architecture of controls, safety, and functional behavior of the electric propulsion system.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Biasini left Tesla and joined Comma.ai in 2016, where he developed the automated lateral and longitudinal controls for the startup&#8217;s first self-driving car system. He later became VP of quality and eventually was named CEO in 2018 after founder George Hotz stepped down from the leadership role. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Biasini went back to work for Musk in 2019 as director of electrical and software engineering at The Boring Company.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At DOGE, Biasini is senior advisor to the director of the Office of Personnel Management, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25536317-biasini-court-doc/?q=biasini&amp;mode=document#document/p9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to a lawsuit</a> filed against the OPM in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which provides his title as listed on an OPM document entitled &#8220;Privacy Impact Assessment for Government-Wide Email System.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Role: </strong>Special Government Employee</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Edward Coristine, a former intern at Neuralink and now known by his infamous LinkedIn profile handle &#8220;bigballs,&#8221; is one of the core members of the DOGE team and the youngest-known Musk aide at age 19, TechCrunch has confirmed. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Since arriving in Washington, D.C., Coristine has been actively involved in accessing federal systems at several government departments, including <a href="https://www.muskwatch.com/p/musk-associates-given-unfettered" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Office of Personnel Management</a>, the <a href="https://x.com/lbarronlopez/status/1886491276729544809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SBA</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/musk-s-doge-teen-was-fired-by-cybersecurity-firm-for-leaking-company-secrets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GSA and USAID</a>, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/10/musk-doge-state-department-surrogate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">State Department, Homeland Security, and FEMA</a>.

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Coristine also used to work for DDoS mitigation company Path Network until he was fired in June 2022 following an alleged &#8220;leaking of proprietary company information that coincided with his tenure,&#8221; Path CEO Marshal Webb told TechCrunch in an email.

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It was around May 2024 that Coristine went to work for Elon Musk&#8217;s Neuralink.

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Before government, the 25-year-old Rutgers University graduate worked at SpaceX, where he focused on vehicle telemetry, Starship, and satellite software, according to an archived copy of his website seen by TechCrunch.
