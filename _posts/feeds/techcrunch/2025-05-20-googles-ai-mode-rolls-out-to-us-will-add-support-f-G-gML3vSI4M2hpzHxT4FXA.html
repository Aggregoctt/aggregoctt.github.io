<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Google&#8217;s AI Mode, the experimental Google Search <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/google-tests-replacing-im-feeling-lucky-with-ai-mode/">feature</a> that lets users ask complex, multi-part questions via an AI interface, will roll out to everyone in the U.S. starting this week, the company announced at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/storyline/google-i-o-2025-live-coverage-gemini-android-16-updates-and-more/">its annual developer conference, Google I/O 2025</a>, on Tuesday.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The feature builds on Google&#8217;s existing AI-powered search experience, AI Overviews, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/google-expands-ai-overviews-in-search-to-more-than-100-countries/">display AI-generated summaries</a> at the top of its search results page. Launched last year, AI Overviews saw mixed results as Google&#8217;s AI offered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/27/googles-ai-overviews-in-hindi-need-a-quality-upgrade/">questionable answers </a>and advice, like a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/26/what-are-googles-ai-overviews-good-for/">suggestion to use glue on pizza</a>, among other things.  </p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">However, Google claims AI Overviews is a success in terms of adoption, if not accuracy, as over 1.5 billion monthly users have used the AI feature. It will now exit Labs. expand to over 200 countries and territories and become available in more than 40 languages, the company says.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">AI Mode, meanwhile, lets users ask complex questions and ask follow-ups. Initially available in Google&#8217;s Search Labs for testing, the feature arrived as other AI companies, like Perplexity and OpenAI, expanded into Google&#8217;s territory with web search features of their own. Worried about potentially ceding search market share to rivals, AI Mode represents Google&#8217;s pitch for what the future of search will look like. </p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As AI Mode rolls out more broadly, Google is touting some of its new capabilities, including Deep Search. While AI Mode takes a question and breaks it up into different subtopics to answer your query, Deep Search does so at scale. It can issue dozens or even hundreds of queries to provide your answers, which will also include links so you can dig into the research yourself. </p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The result is a fully cited report generated in minutes, potentially saving you hours of research, Google says.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company suggested using the Deep Search feature for things like comparison shopping, whether that&#8217;s for a big-ticket home appliance or a summer camp for the kids.</p>
 

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Another<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/google-adds-ai-powered-shopping-features-for-discovery-and-easy-check-out/"> AI-powered shopping feature</a> coming to AI Mode is a virtual &#8220;try it on&#8221; option for apparel, which uses an uploaded picture of yourself to generate an image of yourself wearing the item in question. The feature will have an understanding of 3D shapes and fabric types, and stretch, Google notes, and will begin rolling out in Search Labs today.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In the months ahead, Google says it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/google-adds-ai-powered-shopping-features-for-discovery-and-easy-check-out/">offer a shopping tool for U.S. users</a> that will purchase items on your behalf after it hits a specific price. (You&#8217;ll still have to click &#8220;buy for me&#8221; to kick off this agent, however.)</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Both AI Overviews and AI Mode will now use a custom version of Gemini 2.5, and Google says that AI Mode&#8217;s capabilities will gradually roll out to AI Overviews over time. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">AI Mode will also support the use of complex data in sports and finance queries, available through Labs sometime &#8220;soon.&#8221; This lets users ask complex questions &#8212; like &#8220;compare the Philies and White Sox&#8217; home game win percentages by year for the past five seasons.&#8221; The AI will search across multiple sources, put that data together in a single answer, and even create visualizations on the fly to help you better understand the data. </p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Another feature leverages Project Mariner, Google&#8217;s agent that can interact with the web to take actions on your behalf. Initially available for queries involving restaurants, events, and other local services, AI Mode will save you time researching prices and availability across multiple sites to find the best option &#8212; like affordable concert tickets, for instance. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Search Live, rolling out later this summer, will let you ask questions based on what your phone&#8217;s camera is seeing in real-time. This goes beyond the visual search capabilities of Google Lens, as you can have an interactive back-and-forth conversation with the AI using both video and audio, similar to Google&#8217;s multimodal AI system, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/12/google-wants-to-sell-those-project-astra-ar-glasses-some-day-but-it-wont-be-today/">Project Astra</a>.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Search results will also be personalized based on your past searches, and if you choose to connect your Google Apps using a feature that will roll out this summer. For instance, if you connect your Gmail, Google could know about your travel dates from a booking confirmation email, then use that to recommend events in the city you&#8217;re visiting that will be taking place while you&#8217;re there. (Expecting some pushback over privacy concerns, Google notes that you can connect or disconnect your apps at any time.)</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Gmail is the first app to be supported with personalized context, the company notes. </p>
