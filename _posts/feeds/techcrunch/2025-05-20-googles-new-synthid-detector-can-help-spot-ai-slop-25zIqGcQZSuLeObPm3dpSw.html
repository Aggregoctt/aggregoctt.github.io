<div>
<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Google is launching a way to quickly check whether an image, video, audio file, or snippet of text was created using one of its AI tools. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">SynthID Detector, announced Tuesday at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.slack.com/archives/C08NWK899A7/p1747682603216619">Google I/O 2025</a>, is a verification portal that uses Google&#8217;s SynthID watermarking technology to help identify AI-generated content. Users can upload a file, and SynthID Detector will determine whether the whole sample &#8212; or just a part of it &#8212; is AI-created.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The debut of SynthID Detector comes as AI-generated media floods the web. The number of deepfake videos alone skyrocketed 550% from 2019 to 2024, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://igp.sipa.columbia.edu/news/rise-deepfake-pornography">according to one estimate</a>. Per&#160;<a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/technology-uk/article/why-ai-content-everywhere-how-to-detect-l2m2kdx9p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Times</a>, of the top 20 most-viewed posts on Facebook in the U.S. last fall, four were &#8220;obviously created by AI.&#8221;</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Of course, SynthID Detector has its limitations. It only detects media created with tools that use Google&#8217;s SynthID specification &#8212; mainly Google products. Microsoft&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/microsoft-pledges-to-watermark-ai-generated-images-and-videos/">has its own</a> content watermarking technologies, as do <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/12/meta-releases-a-tool-for-watermarking-ai-generated-videos/">Meta</a> and OpenAI.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">SynthID also isn&#8217;t a perfect technology. Google admits that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/google-is-adding-digital-watermarks-to-images-edited-with-magic-editor-ai/">can be</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/google-releases-tech-to-watermark-ai-generated-text/">circumvented</a>, particularly in the case of text.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">To that first point, Google is arguing that its SynthID standard is already used at a massive scale. According to the tech giant, more than 10 billion pieces of media have been watermarked with SynthID since it launched in 2023.</p>
