<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Google is gearing up to hold its largest developer conference of the year, Google I/O 2025, on May 20 and May 21. CEO Sundar Pichai, DeepMind CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis, and executives in charge of Search, Cloud, and Android will announce major updates to Google&#8217;s product offerings.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">We&#8217;re <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/09/google-i-o-2025-what-to-expect-including-updates-to-gemini-and-android-16/">expecting Google I/O 2025 to focus on AI </a>a lot (seriously, a lot). </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google&#8217;s family of AI models, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/26/what-is-google-gemini-ai/">Gemini</a>, will likely take center stage during Google I/O 2025 as Pichai and Hassabis continue their push for dominance over OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and other well-funded competitors. We&#8217;re also expecting updates around DeepMind&#8217;s projects, such as its multimodal AI system <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/12/google-wants-to-sell-those-project-astra-ar-glasses-some-day-but-it-wont-be-today/">Project Astra</a>. At last year&#8217;s Google I/O, the company teased a pair of smart glasses powered by Project Astra.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A key theme at Google I/O 2025 will be how AI is infiltrating all of Google&#8217;s products. For example, Google&#8217;s head of Search, Elizabeth Reid, is <a href="https://io.google/2025/explore/pa-keynote-18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">giving a talk on the AI stage about how generative AI is &#8220;revolutionizing search</a>.&#8221; Other Google executives are scheduled to speak at the event about <a href="https://io.google/2025/explore/pa-keynote-19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">how scientists are using AI</a>, how <a href="https://io.google/2025/explore/technical-session-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AI agents will use apps for users</a>, and how <a href="https://io.google/2025/explore/pa-keynote-22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Waymo&#8217;s autonomous vehicles use AI</a> to navigate the physical world.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Google I/O 2025 keynote kicks off at 10 a.m. PT on May 20 from the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View. You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NiE3XMPrM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a livestream of Google&#8217;s keynote here</a>, or watch via the embed below. At 1:30 p.m. PT, the <a href="https://io.google/2025/explore/developer-keynote-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">developer keynote begins</a>. As the name suggests, the developer keynote will focus less on the consumer side of things.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Later in the day, at 3:30 p.m. PT, Hassabis will speak with Alex Kantrowitz, host of the Big Technology Podcast, about the <a href="https://io.google/2025/explore/pa-keynote-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">future of DeepMind&#8217;s AI and its impact on the world</a>. At the same time, there will be livestreamed talks about the latest updates to <a href="https://io.google/2025/explore/pa-keynote-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Android,</a> <a href="https://io.google/2025/explore/pa-keynote-13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Chrome</a>, and <a href="https://io.google/2025/explore/pa-keynote-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Cloud</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Some of the talks at Google I/O won&#8217;t be livestreamed, but lucky for you, TechCrunch will be on the ground covering the biggest announcements from the event.</p>
