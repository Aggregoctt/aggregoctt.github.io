<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">As part of an effort to make building AI-powered chatbots on the web simpler, Microsoft is launching an open project called NLWeb. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Announced at Build 2025, NLWeb lets websites provide a &#8220;conversational interface&#8221; &#8212; i.e. a text field and a submission button &#8212; for their users with a few lines of code, the AI model of their choice, and their own data. A retailer could use NLWeb to create a chatbot that helps users choose clothing for specific trips, for example, while a cooking site could use it to build a bot that suggests dishes to pair with a recipe.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Webpages built using NLWeb can optionally make their content discoverable and accessible to AI platforms that support <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/25/anthropic-proposes-a-way-to-connect-data-to-ai-chatbots/">MCP</a>, Anthropic&#8217;s standard for connecting AI models to the systems where data resides.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;[W]e believe [NLWeb] can play a similar role to HTML for the agentic web,&#8221; writes Microsoft in press materials provided to TechCrunch. &#8220;[It] allows users to interact directly with web content in a rich, semantic manner.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Microsoft didn&#8217;t say either way, but NLWeb may have its origins in tech from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Microsoft&#8217;s close collaborator. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Information reported last November that OpenAI was working with partners including Cond&#233; Nast, Redfin, Eventbrite, and Priceline on an early version of NLWeb. Back then, OpenAI was pitching the tech as a way for brands to bring ChatGPT-like conversational features to their websites, but the project faced several delays due to technical hurdles.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Months later, it seems NLWeb is ready for prime time &#8212; albeit perhaps in a different form than OpenAI originally envisioned. </p>
