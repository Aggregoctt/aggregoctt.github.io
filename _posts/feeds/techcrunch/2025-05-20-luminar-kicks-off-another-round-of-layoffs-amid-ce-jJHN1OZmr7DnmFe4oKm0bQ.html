<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Luminar, the lidar company founded by recently replaced CEO Austin Russell, is going through another restructuring, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758057/000162828025026904/lazr-20250331.htm">according to a recent regulatory filing</a>. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This new round of layoffs, which the company did not provide figures for, follows extensive cuts to the workforce in 2024. Luminar cut about 30% of its workforce in 2024, a reduction that was expected to cost $4 million to $6 million in additional cash charges. Some of those layoffs spilled into the first quarter of 2025. A total of 212 employees were laid off. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In its latest regulatory filing, the company said it began additional layoffs May 15. These new layoffs are expected to cost $4 million to $5 million in cash charges. These costs are expected to be incurred in the second and third quarters of this year.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The layoffs are the latest complication for Luminar. Earlier this month, the company&#8217;s board replaced Russell as CEO and board chair. The board issued a press release <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/billionaire-founder-of-luminar-replaced-as-ceo-following-ethics-inquiry/">saying</a> he resigned as the result of an ethics inquiry without providing any additional information. Luminar&#8217;s board replaced Russell and appointed Paul Ricci to the role. Ricci is the former chairman and CEO of Nuance.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A day after the leadership change was announced, board member Jun Hong Heng also resigned,&#160;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758057/000162828025025659/lazr-20250514.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to a regulatory filing</a>, which stated his decision was not due to any disagreements with the company on any matter relating to the company&#8217;s operations, policies, or practices.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company has not responded to requests for comment. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary">Russell became a billionaire after his lidar startup Luminar went public in 2021 after the company merged with special purpose acquisition company Gores Metropoulos Inc., with a post-deal market valuation of $3.4 billion. Luminar raised $250 million prior to the SPAC announcement. </p>
