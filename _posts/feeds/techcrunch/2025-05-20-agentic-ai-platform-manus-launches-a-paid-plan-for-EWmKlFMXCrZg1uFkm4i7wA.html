<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Manus, the once-buzzy AI agent platform, on Tuesday launched a plan aimed at small businesses and organizations.  </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The plan, dubbed Manus Team, starts at $39 per seat per month with a five-seat minimum, totaling $195 per month. Each team gets 19,500 credits in a sharable pool, as well as access to certain features in beta, dedicated infrastructure, and priority access during peak hours.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Credits can be spent on tasks &#8212; for example, copying data from a website to a spreadsheet. Lengthier tasks can burn up <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ManusOfficial/comments/1jnh9ah/the_current_manus_credit_system_is_unreasonably/">hundreds &#8212;  or even thousands &#8212; of credits</a>.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Team users can run up to two tasks concurrently and can optionally use Manus&#8217; &#8220;high-effort mode&#8221; for improved reliability.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Manus, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/09/manus-probably-isnt-chinas-second-deepseek-moment/">went viral in March</a> in part thanks to a buzzy social media campaign, has introduced a number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/manus-launches-paid-subscription-plans-and-a-mobile-app/">premium offerings</a> in recent weeks as well as a mobile app. The startup behind the platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/chinese-ai-startup-manus-reportedly-gets-funding-from-benchmark-at-500m-valuation/">Butterfly Effect</a>, reportedly recently raised $75 million in a funding round led by Benchmark that valued the company at $500 million.</p>
