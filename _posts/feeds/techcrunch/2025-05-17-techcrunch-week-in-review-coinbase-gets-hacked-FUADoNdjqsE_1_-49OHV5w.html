<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Welcome back to Week in Review! We&#8217;ve got tons of news for you this week, including a hack at Coinbase; YC thinks Google is a &#8216;monopolist&#8217;; layoffs at Microsoft; and much more. Have a great weekend!</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Uh-oh:</strong> Coinbase says that customers&#8217; personal information, including government-issued IDs, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/15/coinbase-says-customers-personal-information-stolen-in-data-breach/">stolen in a data breach</a>. The hackers demanded $20 million from the company, CEO Brian Armstrong <a href="https://x.com/brian_armstrong/status/1922967787309256807" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in a post on X</a>. Coinbase said it will not pay the hackers&#8217; ransom.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>IPO time, baby: </strong>After filing confidentially in December, Chime filed for an IPO this week. There are a ton of blanks in the S-1, so we didn&#8217;t get much information, like how many shares insiders plan to sell as part of the IPO. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/25b-valued-chime-files-for-an-ipo-reveals-33m-deal-with-dallas-mavericks/">But we did learn one tidbit</a>: Chime entered a deal with the Dallas Mavericks in 2018, which gained it the Chime logo on the team&#8217;s jersey, among other marketing benefits.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Knock on wood:</strong> This story has been popping off all week &#8212; InventWood created wood called &#8220;Superwood&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/12/inventwood-is-about-to-mass-produce-wood-thats-stronger-than-steel/">that&#8217;s as strong as steel</a>. Ultimately, InventWood is planning to use wood chips to create structural beams of any dimension that won&#8217;t need finishing.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>A big bowl of Granola: </strong>VCs and founders love talking up the apps they&#8217;re using. The most recent case: Granola, an AI note-taking app that&#8217;s recently seen a boost in usage, even though it launched a year ago. And when there&#8217;s usage, money follows. The company announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/ai-note-taking-app-granola-raises-43m-at-250m-valuation-launches-collaborative-features/">it has raised $43 million</a> in a Series B funding round at a valuation of $250 million.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Choice words: </strong>&#8220;Google has chilled independent firms like YC from funding and accelerating innovative startups that could otherwise have challenged Google&#8217;s dominance,&#8221; YC wrote in an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/y-combinator-says-google-is-a-monopolist-that-has-stunted-the-startup-ecosystem/">amicus brief it submitted</a> in the U.S.&#8217; antitrust case against the search giant. But YC isn&#8217;t calling for a complete breakup of Google.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Love to see it: </strong>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/apple-announces-new-accessibility-features-including-future-support-for-brain-implants/">announced a bunch of accessibility features</a>, including Accessibility Nutrition Labels that will inform users of accessibility features within apps and games in the App Store; a new magnifier for Macs; a new Braille experience; and more.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Layoffs at Microsoft: </strong>The company is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-reportedly-about-to-lay-off-3-of-its-workforce/">reportedly laying off 3% of its workforce</a>, or around 6,500 people, affecting all levels, locations, and teams. This follows a solid quarter for Microsoft, with $70.1 billion in revenue (up 13%) and net income profits of $25.8 billion (up 28%). In Washington, around 40% of the 2,000 people laid off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/15/programmers-bore-the-brunt-of-microsofts-layoffs-in-its-home-state-as-ai-writes-up-to-30-of-its-code/">were engineers</a>.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Gemini in your car:</strong> At the Android Show &#8212; Google&#8217;s Android-only event a week ahead of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/09/google-i-o-2025-what-to-expect-including-updates-to-gemini-and-android-16/">Google I/O</a> &#8212; the company announced that it&#8217;s bringing Gemini to cars that support Android Auto. Drivers (and passengers) will be able to send texts, play music, and all the other things a smart assistant does, but using natural language.&#160;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>LOL: </strong>What once was called HBO Go before it changed its name to HBO Now, which later became HBO Max, before settling on Max, announced this week that it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/max-to-be-renamed-hbo-max-fixing-the-name-change-nobody-wanted/">once again changing its name back to HBO Max</a>.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Just call it a bus: </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/uber-to-introduce-fixed-route-shuttles-in-major-us-cities-other-ways-to-save/">Uber is introducing Route Share</a>, a commuter shuttle service that will pick up passengers at pre-set stops in 20-minute intervals. &#8220;You can see a natural extension of us being able to bring Route Share to autonomous vehicles as well,&#8221; Sachin Kansal, Uber&#8217;s chief product officer, told us.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Wait, what? </strong>The New York Times spoke with two investors who said they were pitched a new startup that aims to deliver &#8220;human health optimization&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/10/elizabeth-holmes-partner-reportedly-fundraising-for-new-blood-testing-startup/">using blood testing</a>. Sound familiar? But wait till you hear who pitched the startup: Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes&#8217; partner, Billy Evans. Maybe it&#8217;ll work out better this time?&#160;</p>
