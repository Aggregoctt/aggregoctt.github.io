<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Popular legal AI tool Harvey will now be using leading foundation models from Anthropic and Google, moving beyond strictly using OpenAI&#8217;s, Harvey <a href="https://www.harvey.ai/blog/expanding-harveys-model-offerings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> in a blog post on Tuesday.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This is noteworthy because Harvey is one of the OpenAI Startup Fund&#8217;s most successful early-backed portfolio companies. The OpenAI Startup Fund is an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/01/openais-startup-empire-the-companies-backed-by-its-venture-fund/">OpenAI-associated fund</a> to back companies developing products on top of AI technologies, primarily OpenAI&#8217;s own. While Harvey says it&#8217;s not abandoning OpenAI, merely adding more models and clouds, this is still a huge coup for OpenAI&#8217;s big competitors.&#160;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Harvey is one of the first four startups that the OpenAI Startup Fund backed, it said <a href="https://www.openai.fund/news/introducing-our-first-investments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in December 2022</a>. That was back when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/01/sam-altman-gives-up-control-of-openai-startup-fund-resolving-unusual-corporate-venture-structure/">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman</a> was still running the fund. (The others in that first cohort include Descript, Mem, and Speak.)</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Harvey, which has grown like mad since then, is now a $3-billion-valuation startup, it said in February, when it <a href="https://www.harvey.ai/blog/harvey-raises-series-d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> a $300 million Series D led by Sequoia, with other big names like Coatue, Kleiner Perkins, and the OpenAI Fund piling in.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Interestingly, Google&#8217;s venture arm, GV, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/23/openai-backed-legaltech-startup-harvey-raises-100m/">led Harvey&#8217;s $100 million Series C</a> in July 2024 (and the OpenAI Fund participated in that round, too). But Harvey didn&#8217;t immediately adopt Google&#8217;s AI models after it put Google&#8217;s corporate venture firm on its cap table. (GV participated in Harvey&#8217;s Series D as well.)</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">So, what convinced Harvey to move beyond OpenAI&#8217;s models now? The startup&#8217;s internally developed benchmark, dubbed BigLaw, showed that a wide variety of foundation models are growing increasingly adept at a range of legal tasks and some are better at specific tasks than others.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Instead of spending its efforts training models, Harvey figured, it could simply embrace high-performing, reasoning foundation models from other vendors (e.g. Google and Anthropic via Amazon&#8217;s cloud) and then fine-tune them for the legal market.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Using a variety of models will also help as Harvey creates AI agents, the company says.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;In less than a year, seven models (including three non-OAI models) now outperform the originally benchmarked Harvey system on BigLaw Bench,&#8221; Harvey wrote in the blog post.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Harvey&#8217;s benchmark also showed that different foundation models are better at specific legal tasks than others. For instance, it says Google&#8217;s Gemini 2.5 Pro &#8220;excels&#8221; at legal drafting but &#8220;struggles&#8221; with pre-trial tasks like writing oral arguments because the model doesn&#8217;t fully understand &#8220;complex evidentiary rules like hearsay.&#8221;&#160;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">OpenAI&#8217;s o3 does such pre-trial tasks well, according to Harvey&#8217;s testing, with Anthropic&#8217;s Claude 3.7 Sonnet following close behind. </p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In its blog post, Harvey says that it will also now join the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/the-rise-of-ai-reasoning-models-is-making-benchmarking-more-expensive/">growing ranks of those sharing a public leaderboard</a> of model benchmark performance. Its board will rank how major reasoning models are doing on legal tasks.&#160;And the company won&#8217;t just boil rankings down to a single number, but will also publish research where &#8220;top lawyers provide nuanced insights into model performance not captured by single-score benchmarks.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">So, not only is OpenAI-backed Harvey adopting competitors&#8217; models, it is also amping up the pressure on its backers (including Google) to keep proving themselves. Not that OpenAI should worry much on that score. While AI benchmarking is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/19/ai-benchmarking-organization-criticized-for-waiting-to-disclose-funding-from-openai/">growing increasingly complex and somewhat political</a>, this is a world where OpenAI still shines.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;We are incredibly fortunate to have OpenAI as an investor in Harvey and key collaborator in our product,&#8221; Harvey CEO Winston Weinberg told TechCrunch in a statement. &#8220;And, we are energized to add to our options for customers as we continue to serve the needs of our customers globally.&#8221;</p>
