title: Google inks another massive solar power deal to electrify its data centers
---
<div>
<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Google is buying another 600 megawatts of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/30/data-centers-love-solar-heres-a-comprehensive-guide-to-deals-over-100-megawatts/">solar power</a> to supply electricity to its data centers.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The new deal covers solar and storage projects being developed in South Carolina by EnergyRe. The company says it has 16 gigawatts under development; most projects <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.energyre.com/our-projects">listed</a> on its site have deployed around 60 MW to 75 MW of solar, though some are larger.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google has recently invested heavily in renewables. Last year, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/10/google-kicks-off-20b-renewable-energy-building-spree-to-power-ai/">pledged to invest</a> $20 billion with Intersect Power and TPG Rise Climate to build enough zero-carbon power plants to provide electricity for several gigawatts&#8217; worth of data centers. And in January, the company signed a contract to buy over <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250115123798/en/LRE-Announces-Over-700-MWac-of-New-Solar-Projects-in-Oklahoma-Supported-by-Long-Term-Agreements-with-Google" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">700 megawatts</a> of solar projects in Oklahoma from Leeward Renewable Energy.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Like many tech companies, Google has said it will eliminate its carbon footprint from energy by 2030. After years of steady investment in renewables, Google and its peers had been marching steadily toward that goal.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But the growth of AI and the compute needed to run it has complicated that math, forcing Google and others to step up their purchases. The company contracted 4 gigawatts of clean power <a href="https://sustainability.google/reports/google-2024-environmental-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in 2023</a>, the last year for which Google has made data available.</p>
