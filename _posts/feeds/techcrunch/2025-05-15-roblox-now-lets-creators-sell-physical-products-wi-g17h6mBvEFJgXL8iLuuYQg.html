<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Roblox announced on Thursday that creators can now sell physical merchandise directly within their experiences and games on the platform with the launch of new Commerce APIs. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The offering provides creators with a new way to generate revenue beyond the purchases of virtual goods or one-time fees to access specific experiences. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company first began testing the ability to buy physical merchandise within a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/roblox-and-walmart-are-now-selling-real-world-items-in-game-to-anyone-over-the-age-of-13-its-very-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">few branded experiences</a> in mid-2024. Last September, Roblox announced that creators would soon be able to sell physical items in experiences <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/roblox-introduces-new-earning-opportunities-for-creators-teases-generative-ai-project/">thanks to a partnership with Shopify</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Now, Roblox is making that integration available to all eligible creators and brands after completing a closed beta test of its Commerce APIs.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The ability to purchase physical products will be available in all-ages experiences for U.S. users ages 13 and up. Roblox plans to add more partners and expand the feature to additional markets in the future.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">For brands, the Commerce APIs offer a new way to reach customers. For example, beauty brand Fenty is going to launch a shoppable experience within Roblox to offer an exclusive Gloss Bomb shade called &#8220;Grape Splash.&#8221;</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Eligible creators and brands can also bundle physical purchases with digital items via the new Commerce APIs. That means that you could purchase a physical hoodie and also receive one for your digital avatar.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Roblox&#8217;s new Approved Merchandiser Program (AMP) lets creators and brands connect their real-world or online store purchases to avatar items and accessories on Roblox. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The AMP program and a badge on physical products will serve as a mark of authenticity to show consumers that the items are official. Products with the badge will include a code for a unique digital item relevant to the IP that they can use on Roblox.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Our vision for the future of shopping is an experience that&#8217;s more exciting and social than the traditional online shopping experience,&#8221; the company said in a blog post. &#8220;On Roblox, you can explore virtual stores, try on clothes, and share the experience with others. This naturally builds interest and purchase intent. Now we&#8217;re taking it one step further, bridging the gap between virtual and real-world shopping by enabling Roblox users to purchase physical items.&#8221;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Roblox notes that creator studio Twin Atlas used Commerce APIs in their games to sell physical products and ended up seeing six-figure commerce revenue during the first few weeks. Around 90% of their total orders are placed via their in-game commerce integration, Roblox says. </p>
