<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Epic Games is escalating its efforts to pressure Apple to allow its game Fortnite into its App Store, with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.1568.0.pdf">a new court filing</a> asking Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to require that Apple &#8220;accept any compliant version of Fortnite onto the U.S. storefront of the App Store.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Epic and Apple have been engaged in a years-long legal battle over Apple&#8217;s App Store policies, particularly the commissions Apple charges for in-app purchases.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Fortnite publisher <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/epic-games-just-scored-a-major-win-against-apple/">scored a major victory last month</a> when Judge Rogers ruled that Apple was in &#8220;willful violation&#8221; of an injunction on anti-competitive pricing &#8212; a ruling that seemed to pave the way for Fortnite to return to the App Store, and more broadly, for developers to offer alternative payment options in their apps.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">However, Apple said it will appeal the ruling, and on Friday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/16/epic-games-says-apple-is-blocking-fortnite-from-the-us-and-eu-app-stores/">Epic said Friday the company is blocking Fortnite</a> from both its U.S. App Store and preventing it from being released on the Epic Games store in Europe: &#8220;Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Apple disputed this characterization, specifically the suggestion that it was blocking Fortnite outside the United States. Instead, the company said it asked Epic Sweden to &#8220;resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But why block Fortnite in the United States? Epic released <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/05-15-25-letter-from-apple-14bad27bb985.pdf">a letter</a> signed by Mark A. Perry, an attorney representing Apple, telling Epic&#8217;s lawyers that &#8220;Apple has determined not to take action on the Fortnite app submission until after the Ninth Circuit rules on our pending request for a partial stay of the new injunction.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In its filing, Epic argues that Apple is denying it &#8220;the ability to take advantage of the pro-competitive rules it helped usher in,&#8221; and &#8220;punishing&#8221; Epic &#8220;by shutting it out of the very market it has fought so hard to open &#8212; while sending a clear message to other developers not to challenge Apple&#8217;s practices.&#8221;</p>
