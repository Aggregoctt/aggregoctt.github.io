excerpt: Elon Musk&#8217;s AI company, xAI, has missed a self-imposed deadline to
  publish a finalized AI safety framework, as noted by watchdog group The Midas Project.
  xAI isn&#8217;t exactly known for its strong commitments to AI safety as it&#8217;s
  commonly understood. A recent report found that the company&#8217;s AI chatbot,

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Elon Musk&#8217;s AI company, xAI, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.themidasproject.com/article-list/xai-misses-a-second-self-imposed-deadline-to-implement-a-frontier-safety-policy">has missed a self-imposed deadline</a> to publish a finalized AI safety framework, as noted by watchdog group The&#160;Midas Project.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">xAI isn&#8217;t exactly known for its strong commitments to AI safety as it&#8217;s commonly understood. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/gross-elon-musks-grok-ai-will-undress-photos-of-women-on-x-if-you-ask">A recent report</a> found that the company&#8217;s AI chatbot, Grok, would undress photos of women when asked. Grok can also be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/08/grok-may-soon-get-an-unhinged-mode/">considerably more crass</a> than chatbots like Gemini and ChatGPT, cursing without much restraint to speak of.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Nonetheless, in February at the AI Seoul Summit, a global gathering of AI leaders and stakeholders, xAI published a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wired.com/story/xai-make-ai-more-like-trump/">draft framework</a> outlining the company&#8217;s approach to AI safety. The eight-page document laid out xAI&#8217;s safety priorities and philosophy, including the company&#8217;s benchmarking protocols and AI model deployment considerations.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As The&#160;Midas Project noted in a blog post on Tuesday, however, the draft only applied to unspecified future AI models &#8220;not currently in development.&#8221; Moreover, it failed to articulate how xAI would identify and implement risk mitigations, a core component of a document the company <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-ai-safety-commitments-ai-seoul-summit-2024/frontier-ai-safety-commitments-ai-seoul-summit-2024#:~:text=Articulate%20how%20risk%20mitigations%20will,IV.">signed at the AI Seoul Summit</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In the draft, xAI said that it planned to release a revised version of its safety policy &#8220;within three months&#8221; &#8212; by May 10. The deadline came and went without acknowledgement on xAI&#8217;s official channels.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Despite Musk&#8217;s frequent warnings of the dangers of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/23/tech/elon-musk-ai-your-job">AI</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cindygordon/2024/02/26/elon-musks-urgent-warning-a-digital-god-is-already-here/">gone</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/big-tech-ceos-ai-meeting-senators-musk-zuckerberg-rcna104738">unchecked</a>, xAI has a poor AI safety track record. A recent study by SaferAI, a nonprofit aiming to improve the accountability of AI labs, found that xAI ranks poorly among its peers, owing to its <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ratings.safer-ai.org/">&#8220;very weak&#8221; risk management practices</a>.</p>
