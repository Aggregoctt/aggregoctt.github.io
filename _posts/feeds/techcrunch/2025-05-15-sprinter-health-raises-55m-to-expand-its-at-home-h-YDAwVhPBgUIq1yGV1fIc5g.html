title: Sprinter Health raises $55M to expand its at-home healthcare service

<div>
<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">When Max Cohen and Cameron Behar set out to launch a startup together during the pandemic, they decided to focus on the most top-of-mind sector of the era: healthcare.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But since neither Cohen nor Behar had a background in healthcare (both worked at Google and Facebook previously), they had to think long and hard about how to contribute to a sector that was dominating the public consciousness at the time. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Telehealth was getting tremendously popular, too, in those years, but the duo recognized that not all patients can be served remotely.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">So, Cohen and Cameron built <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sprinterhealth.com/">Sprinter Health</a> to fill that gap, offering at-home preventative services such as blood draws, diabetes eye checks, and colorectal cancer screenings. The startup says its goal is to serve and re-engage patients who haven&#8217;t been using the health system so they can stay healthy for a long time.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Four-year-old Sprinter has been growing fast: it now operates in 18 states (compared to five in 2023), and has seen its revenue increase six-fold over the past year, Cohen said.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">That progress has helped the startup attract a $55 million Series B round led by General Catalyst. Andreessen Horowitz, and other existing investors, including the Regents of the University of California, Google Ventures, and Accel also participated.&#160;The fresh capital brings the startup&#8217;s total funding raised to $125 million.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Sprinter Health&#8217;s secret sauce is its tech logistics system, which provides optimal routes and schedules to its clinical professionals, phlebotomists cross-trained as medical assistants, and community health workers.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;We need to make sure that our employees are spending as much time as possible serving patients rather than driving,&#8221; Cohen said. The company&#8217;s route simulator, which accounts for variables like traffic, weather and parking, helps its staff serve up to 12 patients daily.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;There have been many home-based care companies that have failed because it&#8217;s really hard to make the unit economics work when you are deploying humans into the field,&#8221; Julie Yoo, a general partner at a16z, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Unless you have very tight operating systems, it&#8217;s really hard to build a business that can be sustainable and durable over time.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Yoo, who&#8217;s on the company&#8217;s board, compared Sprinter Health&#8217;s business to Instacart and DoorDash, since the food delivery companies also need to serve as many customers as possible to achieve strong gross margins.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Sprinter Health&#8217;s services are free to members of the company&#8217;s health insurance partners, which include Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
