<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Last week, Elon Musk&#8217;s AI chatbot Grok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/grok-is-unpromptedly-telling-x-users-about-south-african-genocide/">experienced a &#8220;bug&#8221;</a> that made it tell users about the &#8220;white genocide&#8221; conspiracy theory in South Africa, even when prompted with questions that had nothing to do with the topic&#8230; and soon after, Grok expressed skepticism over the Holocaust death toll, which it chalked up to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/18/grok-says-its-skeptical-about-holocaust-death-toll-then-blames-programming-error/"> a &#8220;programming error.&#8221;</a> </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But with a degree of mental gymnastics that could put Simone Biles to shame, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1925939601245430143">has decided</a> that Elon Musk&#8217;s robot baby Grok is too far left.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Grok is left leaning and continues to spread fake news and propaganda,&#8221; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1925939601245430143">Greene</a> wrote on X.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">She shared a screenshot in which Grok says that Greene is a Christian who has expressed her belief in Jesus, but concedes that some Christians are troubled by her support for conspiracy theories like QAnon.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Critics, including religious leaders, argue her actions contradict Christian values of love and unity, citing her defense of January 6 and divisive rhetoric,&#8221; Grok wrote in the screenshot Greene shared.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">X was already having a particularly challenging day &#8212; the app has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/x-continues-to-suffer-bugs-following-thursday-outage/">experiencing outages</a> for hours, which could possibly be related to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-x-datacenter-fire/">fires that broke out in its Oregon data center</a> yesterday. </p>
