<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Gravitee, a platform designed to help companies manage their APIs and other digital traffic pipelines, has raised $60 million in a Series C funding round led by Sixth Street Growth with participation from Riverside Acceleration Capital and Albion VC. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The new capital, which brings Gravitee&#8217;s total raised to just over $125 million, will be used to fund the development of new product features and Gravitee&#8217;s expansion into new markets, said CEO Rory Blundell. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Modern data systems are complex. APIs, for example &#8212; the set of rules that allow different apps to communicate and exchange data &#8212; often come with their own tools and protocols. Blundell makes the case that companies risk creating blind spots and slowing down innovation without a control plane to tie disparate systems together.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;[C]ompanies are integrating AI agents, streaming data, APIs, and hybrid systems faster than ever,&#8221; Blundell said in a statement. &#8220;As a result, many companies face major risks around security, observability, and control of their API and event infrastructure.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Blundell founded Gravitee in 2015 alongside developers Azize Elamrani, David Brassely, Nicolas G&#233;raud, and Titouan Compiegne. What started as an open source project quickly evolved into a business. Today, Gravitee offers paid services to fund development of its freely available software. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Gravitee platform can be deployed on-premises, self-hosted, or used as a part of Gravitee&#8217;s software-as-a-service plan. Features across all releases include a tool for designing APIs and deploying them ahead of mock testing as well as a dashboard from which users can visualize the components of their API deployments.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Gravitee competes with Blobr, which offers software for exposing and monetizing enterprise APIs. Another top rival is&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/stepzens-api-management-vision-begins-to-take-shape-with-free-graphql-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">StepZen</a>, a company developing graph tech to help connect and visualize various APIs.</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Blundell claims that Gravitee is differentiated by its support for both asynchronous APIs (i.e. APIs that return data at a later time) and synchronous APIs (APIs that return data immediately). Some vendors don&#8217;t offer this.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Gravitee has hundreds of customers today, according to Blundell, including Blue Yonder, Michelin, Roche, and Tide. Annual recurring revenue reached $22 million in fiscal year 2024. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Gravitee employs around 130 customers and plans to end the year with roughly 200.</p>
