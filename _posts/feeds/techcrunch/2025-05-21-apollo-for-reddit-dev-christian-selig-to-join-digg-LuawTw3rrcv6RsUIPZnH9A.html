<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Christian Selig, the iOS developer who ran the beloved third-party Reddit client Apollo,  is joining the new iteration of Digg as an advisor.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Earlier this year, Digg&#8217;s original founder Kevin Rose and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/kevin-rose-and-alexis-ohanian-acquire-digg/">acquired what was left of Digg</a> in an attempt to revitalize what was formerly known as &#8220;the internet&#8217;s homepage.&#8221; Rose and Ohanian were already a fascinating pairing &#8212; the two had previously seen each other as rivals, since Digg and Reddit were fierce competitors.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">By adding Selig to the mix, Rose and Ohanian are further signaling that the new Digg wants to shake things up.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Selig played a prominent role in the backlash against Reddit&#8217;s increased API pricing in 2023, which made free apps like Apollo &#8212;  which offered an enhanced browsing experience for Reddit users &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/31/popular-reddit-app-apollo-may-go-out-of-business-over-reddits-new-unaffordable-api-pricing/">impossible to run</a>. In a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/">Reddit post</a> that went viral, Selig told users that in order to keep Apollo running as-is under the new API pricing, he would need to pay about $1.7 million per month. Needless to say, Apollo shut down, much to the Reddit community&#8217;s disappointment.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to have Selig bring that same craft and community-first thinking to Digg, helping us build something that feels good to use and even better to be a part of,&#8221; said Digg CEO Justin Mezzell in a statement.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Digg is embarking on a quest to make the social internet feel fun again, as opposed to its current state, where <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.404media.co/facebooks-algorithm-is-boosting-ai-spam-that-links-to-ai-generated-ad-laden-click-farms/">AI shrimp Jesus</a> and other artificially generated slop have taken over our feeds. But Digg isn&#8217;t quite ready to open to the public just yet. Last month, Digg opened <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/rebooted-digg-launches-early-access-community-with-5-fee/">signups</a> for an early-access program that it&#8217;s calling &#8220;Groundbreakers,&#8221; which asks for a one-time $5 fee to keep bots out. (The proceeds from the program are being donated to nonprofits chosen by the Digg community.)</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In the announcement of Selig&#8217;s role, Mezzell included a cheeky reference to the API drama at Reddit. &#8220;I simply won&#8217;t comment on that. We&#8217;re charting our own course here at Digg,&#8221; Mezzell said. &#8220;But if I did comment, I would probably say &#8216;[redact] me sideways, what a fumble.&#8217; But that would only be if I did say something publicly.&#8221;</p>
