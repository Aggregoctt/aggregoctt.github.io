<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">At the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/16/google-i-o-2025-what-to-expect-including-updates-to-gemini-and-android-16/">Google I/O 2025 developer conference</a>, Google launched <a href="https://stitch.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stitch</a>, an AI-powered tool to help design web and mobile app front ends by generating the necessary UI elements and code.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Stitch can be prompted to create app UIs with a few words or even an image, providing HTML and CSS markup for the designs it generates. Users can choose between Google&#8217;s Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash AI models to power Stitch&#8217;s code and interface ideation. </p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Stitch arrives as so-called vibe coding &#8212; programming using code-generating AI models &#8212; continues to grow in popularity. There&#8217;s a number of large tech startups going after the burgeoning market, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/cursor-in-talks-to-raise-at-a-10b-valuation-as-ai-coding-sector-booms/">Cursor</a> maker Anysphere, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/03/devin-the-viral-coding-ai-agent-gets-a-new-pay-as-you-go-plan/">Cognition</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/15/vibe-coding-startup-windsurf-launches-in-house-ai-models/">Windsurf</a>. Just last week, OpenAI launched a new assistive coding service called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/16/openai-launches-codex-an-ai-coding-agent-in-chatgpt/">Codex</a>. And yesterday during its Build 2025 kickoff, Microsoft rolled out a series of updates to its GitHub Copilot coding assistant.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Stitch is a bit more limited in what it can do compared to some other vibe coding products, but there&#8217;s a fair amount of customization options. The tool supports directly exporting to Figma and can expose code so that it can be refined and worked on in an IDE. Stitch also lets users fine-tune any of the app design elements it generates.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In a demo with TechCrunch, Google product manager Kathy Korevec showed two projects created using Stitch: a responsive mobile UI design for an app for bookworms and a web dashboard for beekeeping.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;[Stitch is] where you can come and get your initial iteration done, and then you can keep going from there,&#8221; said Korevec. &#8220;What we want to do is make it super, super easy and approachable for people to do that next level of design thinking or that next level of software building for them.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Soon after I/O, Google plans to add a feature that&#8217;ll allow users to make changes in their UI designs by taking screenshots of the object they want to tweak and annotating it with the modifications they want, Korevec said. She added that while Stitch is reasonably powerful, it isn&#8217;t meant to be a full-fledged design platform like Figma or Adobe XD.</p>
 

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Alongside Stitch, Google has expanded access to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/google-unveils-project-mariner-ai-agents-to-use-the-web-for-you/">Jules</a>, its AI agent aimed at helping developers fix bugs in their code. Now in <a href="http://jules.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">public beta</a>, the tool helps developers understand complex code, create pull requests on GitHub, and handle certain backlog items and programming tasks.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In a separate demo, Korevec showed Jules upgrading a website running the deprecated Node.js version 16 to Node.js 22. Jules cloned the site&#8217;s codebase in a clean virtual machine and shared a &#8220;plan&#8221; for the upgrade, which Korevec was then prompted to approve. Once the upgrade was completed, Korevec asked Jules to verify that the website still worked correctly &#8212; which Jules did. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Jules currently uses Gemini 2.5 Pro, but Korevec told TechCrunch that users will be able to switch between different models in the future.</p>
