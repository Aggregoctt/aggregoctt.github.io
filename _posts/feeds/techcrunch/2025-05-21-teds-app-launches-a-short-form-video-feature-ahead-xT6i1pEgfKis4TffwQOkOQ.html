<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">With TikTok still facing the possibility of a ban in the U.S., the popularity of short-form video content continues to grow. The latest company to enter this space is <a href="https://www.ted.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TED</a>, the non-profit best known for its TED Talks featuring prominent figures like Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the late Pope Francis.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">On Wednesday, the company announced its new short-form video feature, aptly named &#8220;TED Shorts.&#8221; The feature has gradually rolled out to users since the beginning of May.&#160;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Available on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ted/id376183339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ted.android&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Android</a> devices, TED Shorts can be found in the middle of the navigation bar. By tapping the button, users are taken to a swipeable vertical feed featuring short snippets of TED Talks and other original content. Users can like videos, leave comments, and share with friends.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">TED teamed up with <a href="https://begenuin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genuin</a>, a no-code platform for generative video experiences, to power the TikTok-like feature. As Genuin explained to TechCrunch, TED&#8217;s new feed will be personalized with AI, curating a selection of videos based on factors like personal interests, trending subjects, and other signals to surface the most relevant content for each viewer.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">TED Shorts is one of the more notable additions to the app, which hasn&#8217;t seen a significant update in its 15-year history. Since its launch in 2010, the app has primarily served as a destination for users to access TED Talks and other content via their mobile devices, such as educational animations and 26 podcasts spanning various topics like&#160;business, climate, and health.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The new feature offers a way for users to discover highlights of their favorite speakers before committing to a full-length video. This is also the first time users can engage with one another within the TED app, fostering a sense of community that may have been previously lacking.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">TED already has a substantial following on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/ted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> (26.1 million), <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tedtoks?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TikTok</a> (2.8 million), <a href="https://instagram.com/ted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> (8.1 million), and other social media channels, indicating a demand for short video content.&#160;</p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The launch of TED Shorts comes at a crucial time as the app seeks to boost its growth. Head of Product Tricia Maia tells TechCrunch that the app had been deprioritized &#8220;for several years,&#8221; which impacted its monthly active users and annual growth metrics. According to Appfigures, the app was downloaded 1 million times in 2024, a 17% decline compared to 1.2 million installs in 2023.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">To date, the company boasts more than 30 million app downloads globally.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">TED joins a growing number of companies adopting short-form video content as platforms compete for users&#8217; attention. Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/netflix-is-getting-into-short-videos-with-a-new-vertical-feed-for-mobile/">Netflix</a> revealed that it&#8217;s experimenting with a short video feed for its mobile app.&#160;</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Meanwhile, TikTok faces a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/03/what-to-know-about-tiktoks-uncertain-future-in-the-us-and-the-people-who-want-to-buy-it/">potential ban</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/04/trump-extends-tiktok-ban-deadline-by-75-days/">mid-June</a>, although President Trump <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/04/trump-tiktok-ban-extension-deal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">plans to extend the deadline</a> for a third time as deal negotiations continue. Should U.S. users lose access to TikTok, they might seek <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/17/as-tiktok-faces-a-us-shutdown-here-are-some-alternative-apps-to-check-out/">alternative platforms</a>, and TED hopes they&#8217;ll turn to what it believes is higher-quality content compared to what&#8217;s found on other apps.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;In an era of fragmented attention, people are actively seeking more thoughtful, less overwhelming ways to connect with new ideas, and with each other,&#8221; Maia said. &#8220;[TED Shorts] is our antidote to algorithm fatigue and doom-scrolling low-quality content.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company plans to continue evolving TED Shorts over time to meet user needs while also exploring new ways to enhance community building.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Maia added, &#8220;We&#8217;ll explore ways to add new community features, and expand community-driven features to other TED platforms, like our website&#160;&#8230; This could expand beyond video and mobile to a cross-platform community engagement experience where our audience won&#8217;t just watch videos, but can participate in truly personalized, topic-driven digital communities on a global scale.&#8221;&#160;</p>
