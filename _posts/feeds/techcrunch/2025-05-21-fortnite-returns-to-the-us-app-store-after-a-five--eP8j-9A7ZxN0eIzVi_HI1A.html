<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Popular battle royale game Fortnite has finally returned to the U.S. App Store amid game maker Epic Games&#8217; lengthy legal skirmish with Apple.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As of Tuesday, Fortnite is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1924949632628523199">also available</a> on the Epic Games Store and AltStore in the EU. It&#8217;ll show up in App Store searches soon, Epic said in a post on X.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Apple removed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/fortnite-app-store-removed-apple/">Fortnite from the App Store in 2020</a> after Epic added an option for people to make in-game purchases using Epic&#8217;s virtual currency, for which the company offered a 20% discount. Epic then went on the offensive and sued Apple. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A judge ruled in Epic&#8217;s favor, finding that Apple was in &#8220;willful violation&#8221; of rules that bar anticompetitive pricing. Last month, that judge said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/epic-games-just-scored-a-major-win-against-apple/">Apple must allow developers to collect payments outside the App Store</a> and not levy fees on them.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Following the ruling, Epic resubmitted <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1920878504284975585">Fortnite to the App Store</a> &#8212; but faced an approval delay. The company accused Apple of blocking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/16/epic-games-says-apple-is-blocking-fortnite-from-the-us-and-eu-app-stores/">the game from going live</a> in the U.S. and EU.</p>
