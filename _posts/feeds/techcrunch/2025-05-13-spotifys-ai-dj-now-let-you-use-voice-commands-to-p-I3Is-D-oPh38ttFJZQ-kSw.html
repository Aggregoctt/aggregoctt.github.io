<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">In a bid to make its AI DJ feel more interactive, Spotify is updating the feature to allow users to request music or change the mood of a playlist using voice commands. The company is rolling out this feature, initially only supported in English, in over 60 markets for its Premium subscribers.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Previously, users could only listen to the AI DJ play songs with added commentary in between certain tracks. Now, the feature is becoming interactive.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Users can tell the AI DJ to change the mood or genre, or have it play tracks from specific artists.</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">To use the AI DJ, you can type in &#8220;DJ&#8221; in the search bar, then hold the DJ button on the bottom right to make requests through voice commands. If you want to change the feel of the playlist without making a specific request, you can quickly press the DJ button.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Spotify first launched the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/22/spotify-launches-dj-a-new-personalized-music-lineup-that-includes-ai-powered-commentary/">AI DJ feature in February</a> 2023 in the U.S. and Canada. The company later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/spotify-expands-its-ai-dj-feature-globally/">rolled it out globally in August 2023</a>. Last year, the music streaming company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/17/spotify-adds-a-spanish-speaking-ai-dj-livi/">added support for a Spanish-speaking AI DJ</a>.</p>
