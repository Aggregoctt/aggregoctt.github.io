<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Google I/O, Google&#8217;s biggest developer conference of the year, is nearly upon us. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Scheduled for May 20 to 21 at the&#160;Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, I/O will showcase product announcements from across Google&#8217;s portfolio. Expect plenty of news relating to Android, Chrome, Google Search, YouTube, and &#8212; of course &#8212; Google&#8217;s AI-powered chatbot, Gemini.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Earlier this week, Google hosted a separate event dedicated to Android updates: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/28/google-shifts-android-news-to-a-virtual-event-ahead-of-its-i-o-developer-conference/">The Android Show</a>. The company announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/googles-find-my-device-becomes-find-hub-amid-expansion/">new ways to find lost Android phones and other items</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/google-is-adding-new-device-level-features-for-its-advanced-protection-program/">additional device-level features for its Advanced Protection program</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/google-announces-new-security-features-for-android-for-protection-against-scam-and-theft/">security tools to protect against scams and theft</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/google-unveils-its-new-android-design-language-material-3-expressive/">a new design language called Material 3 Expressive</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Here&#8217;s what else you can expect.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gemini-and-ai">Gemini and AI</h2>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">AI is the tech du jour, and Google, like its rivals, has been investing heavily in it. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A shoo-in for I/O is a new addition (or several) to Google&#8217;s flagship Gemini family of AI models. <a href="https://x.com/glenngabe/status/1917980044934156637" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Leaks</a> over the past few weeks suggest that an updated Gemini Ultra model is on the way, Gemini Ultra being Google&#8217;s top-of-the-line Gemini offering.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">With this upgraded Gemini Ultra may come a pricier Gemini subscription. </p>
 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google offers a single premium tier, Gemini Advanced ($20 per month), to unlock additional capabilities in its Gemini chatbot, which is powered by the company&#8217;s Gemini models. But Google may soon launch two new plans, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-gemini-new-plans-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Premium Plus and Premium Pro</a>. It&#8217;s not yet clear what benefits might be attached and how these plans might be priced relative to Gemini Advanced.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google will almost certainly talk about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/12/google-wants-to-sell-those-project-astra-ar-glasses-some-day-but-it-wont-be-today/">Astra</a>, its wide-ranging effort to build AI apps and &#8220;agents&#8221; for real-time, multimodal understanding. Also probably on the agenda is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/google-unveils-project-mariner-ai-agents-to-use-the-web-for-you/">Project Mariner</a>, Google&#8217;s AI &#8220;agents&#8221; that can navigate and take action across the web on a user&#8217;s behalf. Folks on X <a href="https://x.com/bedros_p/status/1919399274351149417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spotted</a> references to &#8220;Computer Use&#8221; in the code for Google&#8217;s AI Studio developer platform, which could well pertain to Mariner.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-everything-else">Everything else</h2>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Going by the official I/O schedule, Google will have plenty to discuss following The Android Show and I/O keynote addresses. </p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The schedule lists sessions dedicated to Chrome and Google Cloud, Google Play (the Android app store), Android development tools, and Gemma, Google&#8217;s collection of &#8220;open&#8221; AI models.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Last year, Google unveiled a few AI-themed surprises at I/O, including a set of models fine-tuned for education applications called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/14/learnlm-is-googles-new-family-of-ai-models-for-education/">LearnLM</a>. An upgrade to Google&#8217;s viral podcast-generating NotebookLM could be one such surprise. <a href="https://www.testingcatalog.com/google-is-developing-video-overviews-feature-for-notebooklm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Leaked code</a> reveals a &#8220;Video Overviews&#8221; tool that presumably would create video summaries, most likely leveraging Google&#8217;s Veo 2 video-generating model.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Updated: 3:19 p.m. Pacific: Added a list of new Android features announced during The Android Show.</p>
