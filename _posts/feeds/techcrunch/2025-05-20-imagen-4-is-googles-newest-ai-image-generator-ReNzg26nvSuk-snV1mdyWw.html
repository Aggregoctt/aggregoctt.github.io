<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Google is rolling out a new image-generating AI model, Imagen 4, that the company claims delivers higher-quality results than its previous image generator, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/14/google-launches-new-video-and-image-generation-tools/">Imagen 3</a>. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Unveiled at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/storyline/google-i-o-2025-live-coverage-gemini-android-16-updates-and-more/">Google I/O 2025</a> on Tuesday, Imagen 4 is capable of rendering &#8220;fine details&#8221; like fabrics, water droplets, and animal fur, Google says. The model can handle both photorealistic and abstract styles, creating images in a range of aspect ratios and up to 2K resolution.</p>

 


 


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Imagen 4 is [a] huge step forward in quality,&#8221; Josh Woodward, who leads Google&#8217;s Labs group, said during a press briefing. &#8220;We&#8217;ve also [paid] a lot of attention and fixes around how it generates text and topography, so it&#8217;s wonderful for creating slides or invitations, or any other thing where you might need to blend imagery and text.&#8221;</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">There&#8217;s no shortage of AI image generators out there, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/openais-new-image-generator-is-now-available-to-all-users/">ChatGPT&#8217;s viral tool</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/03/midjourney-releases-its-first-new-ai-image-model-in-nearly-a-year/">Midjourney&#8217;s V7</a>. They&#8217;re all relatively sophisticated, customizable, and capable of creating high-quality AI artwork. So what makes Imagen 4 stand out from the crowd?</p>

 

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">According to Google, Imagen 4 is fast &#8212; faster than Imagen 3. And it&#8217;ll soon get faster. In the near future, Google plans to release a variant of Imagen 4 that&#8217;s up to 10x quicker than Imagen 3.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Imagen 4 is available as of this morning in the Gemini app, Google&#8217;s Whisk and Vertex AI platforms, and across Google Slides, Vids, Docs, and more in Google Workspace.</p>
