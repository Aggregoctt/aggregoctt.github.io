<h4>Hello Friends! My name is Sol. I&#8217;m a mom of two who loves to create fun DIYs, crafts, play-based learning&#160;activities and easy recipes. I love creating around a theme especially if it&#8217;s about my favorite adorable characters and well-loved movies. You can find more of my fun creations on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thecraftysol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> and TikTok <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thecraftysol?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@thecraftysol</a>.</h4>

<h4>

<ul>
<li>
<h4>
<span>2 Empty Milk Cartons</span> 
</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><span>Acrylic Paint(s) - Red, Pink, Blue, Purple</span></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><span>Paint Brushes</span></h4>

<h4>

</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><span>Utility Knife</span></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><span>Hot Glue Gun</span></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><span>Print out of your favorite Sanrio Characters</span></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><span>White Spray Paint</span></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><span>Black Permanent Marker</span></h4>

<li>
<h4><span>Wooden Dowel/Small Thin Branch</span></h4>

</li>
</ul>
<h4>&#160;<strong>Instructions:</strong>
</h4>
<h4>1. Prep the empty milk cartons by letting them completely dry (may take a day or two) and coating them with white spray paint. This will make it easier for the acrylic to adhere to the carton.</h4>
<h4>2. Once, the white paint base is completely dry, draw the house design using a pencil. I used an image of Hello Kitty's house as inspiration for my bird house and printed out her family to add to the windows. 
</h4>
<h4>
<span>3.&#160;</span>Using a utility knife, carefully cut out the pieces that will serve as openings and the roof(s) for your bird feeder. This is best done with a ruler and using firm single strokes to achieve smoother edges. Tip: You can sand down rough edges with sand paper for a neat appearance.</h4>
 
<h4>4. It&#8217;s painting time! Paint your design with acrylic paint and let it dry. For the roof pieces, add details with a permanent marker.</h4>
 
<h4>5. Using a hot glue gun, attach the painted roofs on top of your milk carton house.</h4>
<h4>
 6. Using the utility knife, create a hole underneath the door to insert a wooden dowel/branch as a bird perch. Secure end in place with hot glue gun.</h4>
<h4>7. Add your favorite Sanrio characters in the painted windows with a paint brush and glue sealer.</h4>
 
<h4>8. Paint over your birdhouse with&#160;glue sealer to help seal and protect your design.</h4>
 
<h4>9. Punch two small holes on top of the milk carton and thread the craft wire through to form a hook.</h4>
 
<h4>10. Fill with bird seeds and hang by a nearby tree.</h4>
<h4><strong>Helpful tips:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><span>Not a fan of spray paint? Sand the surface of your carton to remove some of the wax and paint with white acrylic paint instead.</span></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>
<span>Feel free to use any size milk carton!</span> 
</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><span>Hot glue a small rock in the inside of your bird house to serve as an anchor for windy days.</span></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><span>Some marker will bleed when&#160;glue sealer is applied. Do a small test on the discarded cut out pieces to see if your marker is good to use.</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
