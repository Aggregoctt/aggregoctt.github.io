            <h4>Hello Friends, let's celebrate National Pancake Day with a delightfully yummy and supercute stack perfect for crisp, fall weather and beyond!</h4>
<h4>Hi, I&#8217;m Jessica, and I&#8217;m the Food Artist, Stylist, and Founder of Luxe and the Lady where I love to share food that&#8217;s as cute as it is delicious! I find inspiration from many different places, but especially cute animals and the beloved characters of my childhood (like Sanrio). I have a massive Hello Kitty collection, and when I was younger even started a Sanrio fan club with my brother and sister (complete with a newsletter). It is such a dream come true to now be able to collaborate with Sanrio to bring some of my favorite characters to life as delicious desserts! You can find even more cute creations and recipes at <a href="https://www.luxeandthelady.com" target="_blank" title="https://www.luxeandthelady.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">luxeandthelady</a> and on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/luxeandthelady/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram @luxeandthelady</a>

<h4>Now, grab a friend and get ready to bake your day a little happier!</h4>
<h4>With a combination of tart, sweet apples, and warm cinnamon-infused spices these Apple Pie Pancakes evoke all the flavors of Hello Kitty&#8217;s favorite food. Instead of a scoop of vanilla ice cream this &#8220;pie&#8221; is topped with an adorably jiggly and velvety smooth Hello Kitty panna cotta (it&#8217;s like ice cream in pudding form). Add fresh apple slices and squishy apple marshmallows to complete this cozy treat. Let's get started!</h4>

<h4><strong>Helpful Tips:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>It is easiest to read all the directions once through, before beginning, as some steps of the recipe require prep.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Warm water makes marshmallows very pliable, so you can easily smooth out any mistakes or mold the shapes, once piped. Dip a clean finger into a mug of warm water then dab onto a paper towel before pressing down any peaks or smoothing (too much water will dissolve the marshmallows).&#160;</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Make the marshmallows and panna cottas the night before serving the pancakes so that they have time to set before handling.</h4>
</li>
</ul>
 
<h4><strong>Directions:</strong></h4>
<h4>1. Let&#8217;s begin with the panna cotta. Add the cold water to a small bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over top. Set aside to bloom for 5 minutes.</h4>
<h4>2. Transfer the cream, milk, vanilla and sugar to a medium saucepan and heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture just begins to simmer. Remove from heat, stir in the softened gelatin until dissolved.&#160;</h4>
 
<h4>3. Pour the panna cotta base into your Hello Kitty mold, filling it about &#8532; full (I found it easiest to place the mold on top of a plate for stability). Cover and transfer to the refrigerator to set for at least 8 hours before unmolding.&#160;</h4>
 
<h4>4. Now for the apple marshmallows. Pour 1/3 cup cold water into the bowl of an electric mixer and sprinkle the gelatin over top. Allow the gelatin to bloom (or soften) while you make the syrup.</h4>
<h4>5. In a medium size saucepan, combine &#188; cup water, sugar, and light corn syrup. Stir, and cook over medium heat until the sugar dissolves.</h4>
<h4>6. Turn the heat up to high and continue to cook (without stirring) until the syrup reaches 240&#176; F on a candy thermometer.</h4>
<h4>7. With the mixer on low, slowly (and carefully) pour the hot syrup into the softened gelatin. Gradually increase the speed to high, and whip until soft peaks form and hold their shape, about 8-10 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and pink/red icing gel coloring, and whip just until incorporated.</h4>
<h4>8. Transfer the marshmallow batter to a microwave safe bowl and heat in the microwave for just 6-7 seconds. This will help keep it smooth while piping. Transfer the marshmallow to a piping bag fitted with a #1A tip.</h4>
<h4>9. Pipe a few dots of the marshmallow onto the corners of a baking pan, line with wax paper, and sift the coating powder on top. Print your favorite Sanrio apple illustration (sized to about 2&#8221;). Using the template (underneath the wax paper), pipe the apples starting at the top left corner, piping to the bottom then the right side (from the bottom to the top right corner) all in one continuous motion. See helpful tips for smoothing. You want to work quickly to pipe as many apples as you can before the marshmallow batter starts to set, but if you are using microwave-safe piping bags you can reheat them for a few (6) seconds as needed (always remove any metal pieces/piping tips before doing this).&#160;</h4>
 
 
<h4>10. Transfer your black melting wafers to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 1 min. at 50% power, stir and repeat in 30-second intervals (at 50% power) until smooth. Use a toothpick to create the designs on a sheet of wax paper with the template underneath, as a guide. Repeat with the green candy wafers for the leaves and stems. Once set, use a toothpick to help transfer the details to the tops of the sticky marshmallows. Set aside until ready to decorate the pancakes. Once you are ready to use the marshmallows you can use more of the coating powder to cover any areas that are still sticky (I like to use a food-safe brush to remove any excess).</h4>
 
<h4>11. You can also make the chocolate details for the panna cotta now. Print your favorite Hello Kitty illustration (sized to match the mold) and place it under a sheet of wax paper (as you did for the apples). Melt the black wafers for the eyes and whiskers, pink for the bow and yellow for the nose. Allow to set before using.&#160;</h4>
 
 
<h4>12. Time for the pancakes! In a medium size mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, apple pie spice, cinnamon, salt, and sugar. Set aside.&#160;</h4>
 
 
 
<h4>13. In a large glass measuring cup, whisk together the milk, applesauce, eggs, vanilla, and butter until smooth.</h4>
<h4>14. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk together until just combined (it&#8217;s ok to have some lumps at this point as we will be mixing again to add the color).</h4>
<h4>15. 5 minutes before you begin cooking the pancakes, heat your griddle or nonstick skillet over medium/medium-low heat. I did not use any butter or oil to grease my pan which also helps to keep the color vibrant. If you notice your first pancake sticking to the pan you can add a tiny bit of oil.</h4>
<h4>16. Divide the batter evenly between 4 bowls (about 2/3 cup batter each). Add gradually more of your pink coloring to each bowl so that the last is the most vibrant, whisking the color in until combined (you don&#8217;t need to remove all the lumps).&#160;</h4>
 
 
<h4>17. Working with 1 bowl at a time, scoop 1/3 cup batter into the middle of your prepared griddle or skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes on the first side (until bubbles rise to the surface and begin to pop), then flip and cook for 1-2 minutes on the second side until cooked through. Transfer the finished pancakes to a plate. Continue to cook the pancakes until you&#8217;ve used all the batter.</h4>
<h4>18. Stack the pancakes with the lightest pink on the bottom working your way up to the brightest pink pancakes. Now we will decorate!</h4>
<h4>19. Very carefully loosen the sides of the silicone mold with the panna cotta. You can either invert it directly on top of your pancake stack or (to be extra cautious) place your top pink pancake onto a separate plate and press it against the bottom of the mold, then flip the mold over to release. Transfer the pancake (with the panna cotta) back to the stack. Use a toothpick to help transfer the chocolate pieces to the top for Hello Kitty&#8217;s face. To add the cheeks, dab a pink food marker onto a clean paper towel and then onto the panna cotta under each eye.</h4>
<h4>20. Add whipped cream (if desired) and decorate with fresh apple slices and the apple marshmallows. Admire your adorable work of art then enjoy!</h4>
 
<h4>Leftover pancakes and panna cotta can be covered and refrigerated for about 3 days (pancakes can be frozen to keep longer). Leftover marshmallows also freeze great!</h4>
