<h4><span>Kiki and Lala were born on the Omoiyari Star in the Yume Star-Cloud and were sent to Earth by their parents to shine as brightly as they were meant to. Kiki&#8217;s mother tied a special flying star that would carry him and his sister across the sky. Lala&#8217;s father gave her a magical star wand to guide the twins on their journey.&#160;</span></h4>
