title: The AI Slop Presidency

<div>
  <p>Trump has found an aesthetic to define his second term: grotesque AI slop.</p><p>Over the weekend, the Trump administration posted at least <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1918702410152759629?ref=404media.co">seven different pieces</a> of AI generated or AI altered media, ranging from Trump imagining <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1919053040734072844?ref=404media.co">himself as a pope</a> and a <a href="https://x.com/DODResponse/status/1919030454339953132?ref=404media.co">Star Wars Jedi</a> (<a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1919053040734072844?ref=404media.co">or Sith?</a>) to <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1918729860756754888?ref=404media.co">Obama-esque &#8220;Hope&#8221; posters</a> featuring <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1919552538447097970?ref=404media.co">people the administration has deported</a>.&#160;</p><p>This has become the Slop Presidency, and AI-generated images are the perfect artistic medium for the Trump presidency. They're impulsively created, grotesque, and low-effort. Trumpworld&#8217;s fascination with slop is the logical next step for a President that, in his first term, regularly retweeted random memes created by his army of supporters on Discord or The Donald, a subreddit that ultimately became a Reddit-clone website after it was banned. AI allows his team to create media that would never exist otherwise, a particularly useful tool for a President and administration that has a hostile relationship with reality.&#160;</p>
