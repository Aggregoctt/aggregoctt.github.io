<p>Job hunting can be a dehumanizing, demoralizing experience even if you&#8217;re interacting with an empathetic recruiter on the other end. For the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf?ref=404media.co">1.7 million people</a> slogging through long-term unemployment in the U.S., the process is grueling at best. Add to this the advent of AI-generated recruiter avatars that glitch out on you before you even speak to a real person at the company you&#8217;re trying to work for, and now you&#8217;re truly in hell.</p><p>This week, TikTok user @its_ken04, who goes by Ken, posted a recording she took of 25 seconds of the &#8220;interview&#8221; that&#8217;s now viral on TikTok. In the video, the avatar says &#8220;vertical bar pilates&#8221; 14 times in a row, occasionally tripping over the words or stuttering, while Ken stares at the screen unamused.&#160;</p>
