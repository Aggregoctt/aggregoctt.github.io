<p>Civitai, an AI model sharing site backed by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) that 404 Media has repeatedly shown is being used to generate nonconsensual adult content, lost access to its credit card payment processor.</p><p>According to an <a href="https://civitai.com/articles/14945?ref=404media.co">announcement</a> posted to Civitai on Monday, the site will &#8220;pause&#8221; credit card payments starting Friday, May 23. At that time, users will no longer be able to buy &#8220;Buzz,&#8221; the on-site currency users spend to generate images, or start new memberships.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;Some payment companies label generative-AI platforms high risk, especially when we allow user-generated mature content, even when it&#8217;s legal and moderated,&#8221; the announcement said. &#8220;That policy choice, not anything users did, forced the cutoff.&#8221;</p><p>Civitai&#8217;s CEO Justin Maier told me in an email that the site has not been &#8220;cut off&#8221; from payment processing.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;Our current provider recently informed us that they do not wish to support platforms that allow AI-generated explicit content,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;Rather than remove that category, we&#8217;re onboarding a specialist high-risk processor so that service to creators and customers continues without interruption. Out of respect for ongoing commercial negotiations, we&#8217;re not naming either the incumbent or the successor until the transition is complete.&#8221;</p><p>The announcement tells users that they can &#8220;stock up on Buzz&#8221; or switch to annual memberships to prepare for May 23. It also says that it should start accepting crypto and ACH checkout (direct transfer from a bank account) within a week, and that it should start taking credit card payments again with a new provider next month.</p><p>&#8220;Civitai is not shutting down,&#8221; the announcement says. &#8220;We have months of runway. The site, community, and creator payouts continue unchanged. We just need a brief boost from you while we finish new payment rails.&#8221;</p><p>In April, Civitai announced <a href="https://www.404media.co/civitai-is-banning-ai-generated-incest-and-diapers/">new policies</a> it put in place because payment processors were threatening to cut it off unless it made changes to the kind of adult content that was allowed on the site. This included new policies against adult content that included diapers, guns, and further restrictions on content including the likeness of real people.&#160;</p><p>The announcement on Civitai Monday said that &#8220;Those changes opened some doors, but the processors ultimately decided Civitai was still outside their comfort zone.&#8221;</p><p>In the comments below the announcement, Civitai users debated how the site is handling the situations.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think you need to get rid of all celebrity LoRA [custom AI models] on the site, honestly,&#8221; the top comment said. &#8220;Especially with the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-sign-bill-cracking-deepfake-pornography-rcna207693?ref=404media.co">Take It Down Act</a>, the risk is too high. Sorry this is happening to you guys. I do love this site. Edit: bought an annual sub to try and help.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;If it wasn't for the porn there would be considerably less revenue and traffic,&#8221; another commenter replied. &#8220;And technically it's not about the porn, it's about the ability to have free expression to create what you want to create without being blocked to do so.&#8221;</p><p>404 Media has published <a href="https://www.404media.co/a16z-funded-ai-platform-generated-images-that-could-be-categorized-as-child-pornography-leaked-documents-show/">several</a> <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-ai-porn-marketplace-where-everything-and-everyone-is-for-sale/">stories</a> since 2023 showing that Civitai is often used by people to produce nonconsnesual content. Earlier today we <a href="https://www.404media.co/configuration-issue-allows-civitai-users-to-ai-generate-nonconsensual-porn-videos/">published a story</a> showing its on-site AI video generator was producing nonconsensual porn of anyone. </p>
