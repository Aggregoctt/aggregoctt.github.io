<p>Participating in interactive adult live-streams or ordering custom porn clips are about to be punishable by a year in prison in Sweden, where a new law expands an already-problematic model of sex work criminalization to the internet.</p><p>Sex work in Sweden operates under the Nordic Model, also known as the &#8220;Equality,&#8221; &#8220;Entrapment,&#8221; or &#8220;End Demand Model,&#8221; which criminalizes buying sex but not selling sex. The text of the newly-passed bill (in the original Swedish <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25950455-skarpt-syn-pa-sexuella-krankningar-bedragerier-mot-aldre-och-brott-med-kon-som-hatbrottsmotiv-prop-202425124/?ref=404media.co">here</a>, and auto-translated to English <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25950456-skarpt-syn-pa-sexuella-krankningar-bedragerier-mot-aldre-och-brott-med-kon-som-hatbrottsmotiv-prop-202425124translated/?ref=404media.co">here</a>) states that criminal liability for the purchase of sexual services shouldn&#8217;t have to require physical contact between the buyer and seller anymore, and should expand to online sex work, too.&#160;</p><p>Buying pre-recorded content, paying to follow an account where pornographic material is continuously posted, or otherwise consuming porn without influencing its content is outside of the scope of the law, the bill says. But live-streaming content where viewers interact with performers, as well as ordering custom clips, are illegal.</p><p>Criminalizing any part of the transaction of sex work has been shown to make the work more dangerous for all involved; <a href="https://decriminalizesex.work/equality-model-2/?ref=404media.co">data shows</a> sex workers in Nordic Model countries like Sweden, Iceland, and France are <a href="https://decriminalizesex.work/equality-model-2/?ref=404media.co">put in more danger</a> by this model, not made safer. But the objective of this model isn&#8217;t actually the increased safety of sex workers. It&#8217;s the total abolition of sex work.&#160;</p><p>This law expands the model to cover online content, too&#8212;even if the performer and viewer have never met in person. &#8220;This is a new form of sex purchase, and it&#8217;s high time we modernise the legislation to include digital platforms,&#8221; Social Democrat MP Teresa Carvalho said, <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/sweden-bans-paid-online-sexual-acts-in-law-targeting-platforms-like-onlyfans/?ref=404media.co">according to Euractiv</a>.&#160;</p><p>Sweden&#8217;s law isn&#8217;t isolated to European countries. In the U.S., <a href="https://catwinternational.org/2023/07/maine-becomes-first-u-s-state-to-pass-equality-model-law/?ref=404media.co">Maine adopted the Nordic Model</a> in 2023. The expansion of the law in Sweden goes into effect on July 1.&#160;&#160;</p>
