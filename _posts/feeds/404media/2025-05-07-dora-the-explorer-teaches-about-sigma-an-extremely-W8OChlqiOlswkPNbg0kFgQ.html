<p>Dora the Explorer, the cute Nickelodeon cartoon character, is teaching kids what it means to be &#8220;Sigma,&#8221; a slang term describing an extremely toxic male archetype which originates in the darkest corners of the so-called &#8220;manosphere.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Hola, grown-ups! Today I have a super cool word for you! Sigma,&#8221; a 3D rendered version of Dora says in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJSUN2-IoXP/?ref=404media.co">a video</a> uploaded to the official Dora the Explorer Instagram account yesterday. &#8220;&#8216;Sigma&#8217; is a word for someone who&#8217;s confident, independent, and does things their own way! Think of it as someone who&#8217;s a leader and a trendsetter. Let&#8217;s say your friend is doing their own thing, focusing on their goals, and not worrying about what others think. You can say, &#8216;you&#8217;re such a SIGMA!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
