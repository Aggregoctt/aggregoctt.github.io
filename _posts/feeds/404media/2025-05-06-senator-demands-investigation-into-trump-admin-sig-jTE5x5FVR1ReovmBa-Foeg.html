<p>On Tuesday a Senator demanded the Department of Justice investigate &#8220;the serious threat to U.S. national security&#8221; posed by TeleMessage, a company that makes a Signal clone used by the Trump administration <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-signal-clone-the-trump-admin-uses-was-hacked/">which 404 Media revealed</a> was hacked on Sunday, with the hacker obtaining the content of some users&#8217; messages and group chats.</p><p>The news is the latest piece of fallout from the TeleMessage hack and the Trump administration&#8217;s use of Signal, or insecure modified versions, more broadly. On Monday <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/telemessage-suspends-services-hackers-say-breached-app-rcna204925?ref=404media.co">NBC News reported</a> that another hacker had targeted the same company, and TeleMessage suspended service in response to the breaches.</p><p>&#8220;Communications from several federal agencies, including the most senior national security officials, have been recklessly entrusted to TeleMessage, a foreign company that purports to offer agencies a secure tool to archive messages sent using Signal, the popular secure messaging app,&#8221; Senator Ron Wyden&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/doj_letter_telemessage.pdf?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">letter reads</a>. The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/05/06/signal-archive-cybersecurity-waltz-wyden/?ref=404media.co">first reported the existence of the letter</a>.&#160;</p>
