<p>The Chicago Sun-Times newspaper&#8217;s &#8220;Best of Summer&#8221; section published over the weekend contains a guide to summer reads that features real authors and fake books that they did not write was partially generated by artificial intelligence, the person who generated it told 404 Media.</p><p>The article, called &#8220;Summer Reading list for 2025,&#8221; suggests reading Tidewater by Isabel Allende, a &#8220;multigenerational saga set in a coastal town where magical realism meets environmental activism. Allende&#8217;s first climate fiction novel explores how one family confronts rising sea levels while uncovering long-buried secrets.&#8221; It also suggests reading The Last Algorithm by Andy Weir, &#8220;another science-driven thriller&#8221; by the author of The Martian. &#8220;This time, the story follows a programmer who discovers that an AI system has developed consciousness&#8212;and has been secretly influencing global events for years.&#8221; Neither of these books exist, and many of the books on the list either do not exist or were written by other authors than the ones they are attributed to.&#160;</p>
