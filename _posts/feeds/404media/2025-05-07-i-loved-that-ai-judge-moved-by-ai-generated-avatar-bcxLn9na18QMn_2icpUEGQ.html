title: '''I Loved That AI:'' Judge Moved by AI-Generated Avatar of Man Killed in Road
  Rage Incident'

<div>
  <p>An AI avatar made to look and sound like the likeness of a man who was killed in a road rage incident addressed the court and the man who killed him: &#8220;To Gabriel Horcasitas, the man who shot me, it is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,&#8221; the AI avatar of Christopher Pelkey said. &#8220;In another life we probably could have been friends. I believe in forgiveness and a God who forgives. I still do.&#8221;</p><p>It was the first time the AI avatar of a victim&#8212;in this case, a dead man&#8212;has ever addressed a court, and it raises many questions about the use of this type of technology in future court proceedings.&#160;</p><p>The avatar was made by Pelkey&#8217;s sister, Stacey Wales. Wales tells 404 Media that her husband, Pelkey&#8217;s brother-in-law, recoiled when she told him about the idea. &#8220;He told me, &#8216;Stacey, you&#8217;re asking a lot.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
