title: AI-Powered Coca-Cola Ad Celebrating Authors Gets Basic Facts Wrong
---
<div>
  <p>In April, Coca-Cola proudly launched a new ad campaign it called &#8220;Classic,&#8221; <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91316441/coca-cola-clever-new-logo-in-books?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=social">celebrating famous authors</a> and the sugary drink&#8217;s omnipresence in culture by highlighting classic literary works that mention the brand. The firm that produced the ad campaign said it used AI to scan books for mentions of Coca-Cola, and then put viewers in the point of view of the author, typing that portion of the text on a typewriter. The only issue is that the AI got some very basic facts about the authors and their work entirely wrong.&#160;</p><p>One of the ads highlights the work of J.G. Ballard, the British author perhaps best known for his controversial masterpiece, Crash, and David Cronenberg&#8217;s film adaptation of the novel. In the ad, we get a first person perspective of someone typing a sentence from &#8220;Extreme Metaphors by J.G Ballard,&#8221; which according to the ad was written in 1967.&#160; When the sentence gets to the mention of &#8220;Coca-Cola,&#8221; the typeface changes from the generic typewriter font to Coca-Cola&#8217;s iconic red logo.&#160;</p>
