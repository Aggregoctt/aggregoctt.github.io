<p>Republican Senator of Utah Mike Lee introduced a bill that would effectively ban porn at the federal level in the United States.</p><p>The Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA), introduced by Lee and Illinois Republican Rep. Mary Miller on Thursday, aims to change the Supreme Court&#8217;s 1973 &#8220;Miller Test&#8221; for determining what qualifies as obscene. &#8220;Obscenity isn&#8217;t protected by the First Amendment, but hazy and unenforceable legal definitions have allowed extreme pornography to saturate American society and reach countless children,&#8221; Lee <a href="https://www.lee.senate.gov/2025/5/lee-bill-establishes-obscenity-definition-across-states?ref=404media.co">said in a press release</a>. &#8220;Our bill updates the legal definition of obscenity for the internet age so this content can be taken down and its peddlers prosecuted.&#8221;</p>
