<p>While other social media sites and streaming services rush to scrub Kanye West&#8217;s pro-Nazi song from their platforms , the curious or the enthused can find memes, remixes, and unedited audio of West&#8217;s new song, &#8220;Heil Hitler,&#8221; all over Instagram.</p><p>Nazism is one of the only groups that Meta calls out by name in its own rules. In the current version of its community standards policy regarding &#8220;<a href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/dangerous-individuals-organizations/?ref=404media.co">Dangerous Organizations and Individuals</a>,&#8221; the company says it will remove any content that promotes Nazis. &#8220;We&#8230;remove content that Glorifies, Supports or Represents ideologies that promote hate, such as nazism and white supremacy.&#8221;</p><p>404 Media found dozens of Instagram reels that featured the song and several of them had been viewed more than a million times. One reel, which has been viewed 1.2 million times, declared it the song of the summer. &#8220;How we all bumpin&#8217; Kanye&#8217;s New song This summer,&#8221; it says over footage of people dancing.</p><p>Another reel with more than 40,000 views shows Hasidic Jews dancing over the song under the caption &#8220;Amazing things are happening.&#8221;</p><p>A third depicts a white dude in khaki pants dancing to the song in front of a glowing and spinning swastika. &#8220;White dads getting turnt to Kanye&#8217;s new song at the summer barbecue &#128293;,&#8221; reads the caption. It&#8217;s been viewed more than 700,000 times. The account that shared it describes itself as a &#8220;race realist and meme guy&#8221; in the bio. Much of its content is memed-up clips of avowed white supremacist Nick Fuentes.</p>
 
 
 
<p>&#8220;Heil Hitler&#8221; is the latest single from Kanye West&#8217;s forthcoming album Cuck. In the song he talks about how the world has been cruel to him. &#8220;Man, these people took my kids from me / Then they froze my bank account / I got so much anger in me,&#8221; Ye raps. It is these tribulations, he sings, that made him a Nazi.</p><p>The video for the song racked up millions of views on X and is still up. It was also briefly available on major streaming platforms like Spotify and Soundcloud before getting pulled. Even the Genius page for the song was pulled.</p><p>"We recognize that users may share content that includes references to designated dangerous organizations and individuals in the context of social and political discourse," a Meta spokesperson told us in an email. "This&#160;includes content reporting on, neutrally discussing or condemning dangerous organizations and individuals or their activities." </p><p>None of the videos we've seen were "reporting on" the song. Some were arguably making fun of it, but most of of them were just sharing or celebrating it.  </p><p>We have reported many stories about Meta&#8217;s inability or unwillingness many types of content on Instagram that goes against its own rules, including accounts that face swap models that make them look like they have <a href="https://www.404media.co/people-are-using-ai-to-create-influencers-with-down-syndrome-who-sell-nudes/">down syndrome</a>, AI-generated accounts that pretend to be <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-booming-ai-pimping-industry-3/">real people</a>, accounts <a href="https://www.404media.co/instagram-throttles-404-media-investigation-into-drug-ads-on-instagram-continues-to-let-people-advertise-drugs/">advertising illegal drugs</a> and firearms on the site, and accounts promoting various <a href="https://www.404media.co/why-do-these-instagram-electricians-want-to-deep-throat-you/">scams</a>.</p><p>In theory these videos should be relatively easy to find, remove, or even prevent people from uploading to begin with. Internet platforms like YouTube and Twitch have technology that automatically detects audio to flag content that may violate copyright. The same method can also be used to flag certain audio and prevent users from uploading it. Additionally, one reason we were able to find so many of these videos so quickly is that, like TikTok, Instagram has a feature that shows users what other videos were uploaded to the platform using the exact same sound.&#160;</p><p>Update: This article has been updated with comment from Meta.</p>
