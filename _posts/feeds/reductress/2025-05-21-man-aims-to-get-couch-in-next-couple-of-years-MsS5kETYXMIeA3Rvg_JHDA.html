title: Man Aims to Get Couch in Next Couple of Years
---
<div>

	<p>Proving that everyone can dream big and achieve, 32-year-old Neil O&#8217;Malley has made it known that it is his goal to acquire a couch for his apartment sometime in the next couple of years.&#160;</p>
 
<p>&#8220;My place is pretty bare now, but I&#8217;m determined to make sure it doesn&#8217;t stay that way forever,&#8221; Neil told reporters from a stool in his kitchen, which also serves as his coffee table and dining room. &#8220;I&#8217;m actually hoping to get a couch sometime soon. Don&#8217;t count me out just yet. Things are looking up.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Reporters flagged that &#8220;hoping to get a couch&#8221; is a rather noncommittal phrase that doesn&#8217;t suggest he&#8217;s making active moves towards this goal. Neil agreed.&#160;</p>
 
<p>&#8220;Yeah, like, I&#8217;m hoping it happens,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;And I&#8217;m pretty sure that hoping is a major part of the process.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>When asked whether he&#8217;s searched the internet for a suitable couch yet, Neil responded, &#8220;Like, on Twitter? No. Why would there be a couch there?&#8221;&#160;</p>
 
<p>Reporters concurred that it would be unlikely for someone to sell a couch over a social media platform, then clarified that they were asking whether he had visited a furniture store or website to see which options were available to him.&#160;</p>
 
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;I&#8217;m really bad at choosing stuff. It&#8217;s so hard for me. Plus, I don&#8217;t know what the best stuff is.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Reporters then informed Neil that no one really <i>knows </i>&#8220;what the best stuff is&#8221; &#8211; people just make choices and assess from there.&#160;</p>
 
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not really how my couch journey is going to work,&#8221; he continued, indignant. &#8220;I&#8217;m probably just going to wait until I have a girlfriend or wife who has a strong opinion, you know?&#8221;</p>
 
<p>This sent a shiver down reporters&#8217; spines, and they collectively let out a soft prayer for the poor girl who would be forced to take on this man&#8217;s interior decorating in the future.&#160;</p>
 
 
 
<p>&#8220;Look, I&#8217;m moving up in the world and doing pretty well at work, as I&#8217;m sure you can tell by my sick new gaming chair,&#8221; Neil continued, directing reporters&#8217; attention to the immaculate gaming setup he had in the corner, which was the only section of the room that appeared furnished. &#8220;I think it&#8217;ll be time for me to add a couch to my collection in two, maybe three years.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>As far as what guests currently do when they come over to his house, Neil maintains it&#8217;s not an issue.&#160;</p>
 
<p>&#8220;We sit on my bed,&#8221; he said confidently, gesturing to his mattress on the floor. &#8220;It&#8217;s super comfy and probably doesn&#8217;t have bed bugs anymore.&#8221;</p>
