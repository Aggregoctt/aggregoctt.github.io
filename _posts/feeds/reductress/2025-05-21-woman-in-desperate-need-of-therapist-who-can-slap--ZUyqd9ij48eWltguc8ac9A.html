title: Woman in Desperate Need of Therapist Who Can Slap Her
---
<div>

	<p>In a dire story emerging from Los Angeles, CA, 28-year-old Maia Beauford is in desperate need of a therapist who can go beyond the typical techniques of cognitive behavioral therapy and instead just slap the shit out of her.&#160;</p>
 
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in therapy for a few years, so I&#8217;m well aware of the destructive patterns I&#8217;ve been repeating,&#8221; Maia told reporters gathered at the scene. &#8220;It&#8217;s not enough to know. I need something more. I need my therapist to slap me across the face.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Sources confirm Maia is very good at intellectualizing her emotions and thinking her way out of any negative feeling, but this has only led to a deeper issue where she constantly recognizes destructive thought patterns but is still unable to break them. According to Maia, this is where the slap will come in.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;Take my most recent problem, for example,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I&#8217;m really into this guy, but he refuses to commit. I know I should leave him and search for a relationship with someone who wants the same things I want. I <i>know </i>that. But I still don&#8217;t do it. I need my therapist to stop this destructive downward spiral by hitting me in the face.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Maia&#8217;s therapist, 56-year-old Felicia Lee, agrees that this would likely be enough of a shock to the system that it would snap Maia out of her typical thought patterns, but the issue of &#8220;ethical practices&#8221; is the only thing standing in the way.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;Look, I want to slap her as much as the next person, perhaps even more,&#8221; Felicia told reporters. &#8220;I&#8217;m just not allowed to do it. Hearing her talk about how much she hates her career in marketing and just wants to be a full-time painter for the past three years has been infuriating. I would love to hit her really quickly across the face just once and yell, &#8216;QUIT!&#8217; The sad thing is, therapists aren&#8217;t allowed to slap their clients the way they used to.&#8221;</p>
 
 
 
<p>Reporters confirm therapists have never been allowed to slap their patients, so it&#8217;s unclear what past Felicia is referencing.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;I know where I need to change, but I still need a push to actually <i>do </i>it, you know?&#8221; Maia continued. &#8220;Sorry, not a &#8216;push.&#8217; More like a punch.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>As of press time, Maia had settled on a middle ground wherein her therapist would not technically slap her, but would have her permission to make a motion as if she were slapping her. Maia told reporters she&#8217;s hopeful this will be embarrassing enough that it will force her to take a long, hard look in the mirror and change her ways.&#160;</p>
