title: Woman Silences Fictional Intrusive Thought With Real-Life Embarrassing Memory
---
<div>

	<p>In a genius plot emerging from Manhattan, NY, 27-year-old Phaedra Harper was in a very important board meeting this morning when she successfully managed to silence her fictional intrusive thought by instead fixating on a real-life embarrassing memory.&#160;</p>
 
<p>&#8220;I could not stop having this intrusive thought during my meeting that I had hit someone with my car on the way to work,&#8221; Phaedra told reporters gathered at the scene. &#8220;And I know it isn&#8217;t true because I probably would have noticed if I&#8217;d hit someone with my car. That&#8217;s the type of thing you notice! But maybe I hadn&#8217;t&#8230;&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Phaedra then made the genius move to trade the devil she didn&#8217;t know for the one she did, instead choosing to think long and hard about a time two years ago when she publicly forgot the name of someone she&#8217;d technically known for about a decade.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;It worked like a charm!&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Now, I can&#8217;t stop thinking about the sheer bodily embarrassment I experienced at the time, but at least I&#8217;m not scared I committed an accidental homicide.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Sources confirm the moment in question was extremely embarrassing for all involved, but mostly for Phaedra.&#160;</p>
 
<p>&#8220;There was this woman I&#8217;d seen so many times &#8211; I mean, we met in college! &#8211; but I&#8217;d never internalized what her name was,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;It was way too late to ask, though, so I made a very public swing by calling her Cheryl, only to be immediately corrected that her name was Diya. Not even the correct region of the world&#8230;&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Friends at the scene confirm there was a very uncomfortable awkward silence as Diya visibly teared up and excused herself to the other room with a fake smile.&#160;</p>
 
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t my fault! The ruse had just gone on too long!&#8221; Phaedra continued while staring off into the distance. &#8220;Now that I&#8217;m thinking about this, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to stop for the rest of the day. But, at least it&#8217;s more manageable than the other thing!&#8221;</p>
 
 
 
<p>Coworkers confirm hearing Phaedra whisper &#8220;Diya, Diya, Diya,&#8221; to herself throughout the day in some form of self-punishment.&#160;</p>
 
<p>&#8220;I can tell everyone is really concerned about me, but I couldn&#8217;t be more thrilled with the way this has turned out,&#8221; Phaedra continued. &#8220;I&#8217;m so embarrassed by my past mistake that I don&#8217;t even have the bandwidth to <i>consider </i>the possibility that I hit and killed a pedestrian this morning without realizing it!&#8221;</p>
 
<p>As of press time, Phaedra was on her way home, hit a pothole, and is now once again convinced she has killed someone.&#160;</p>
