<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Blue Prince&#8217;s planned 1.10 update, which will add things like a color assist mode, controls remapping, and more, will be the &#8220;final major update&#8221; and the &#8220;definitive version&#8221; of the game, director Tonda Ros says in notes for the 1.04.5 patch <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1569580%2Fview%2F516336614597722729" rel="sponsored">that was released today</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;It had always been my dream to release a definitive version of the game at launch,&#8221; Ros says. &#8220;I&#8217;m a big fan of complete standalone experiences and it was never my plan to continually tinker with the game with regular content updates, room rebalancing, or DLC and the like. Considering this is my first game, I&#8217;m extremely proud of everything I managed to include for launch, but there are a few minor things that were not quite completed before our release date that I feel must be added to fulfill that original vision.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Here&#8217;s what you can expect in that 1.10 update, according to Ros:</p><blockquote class="duet--article--blockquote ewrhy30 _1xwtict9"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Among the planned inclusions in this final update: an overhyped arcade game, a curious house cat, accessibility features like color assist mode, controls remapping, cursor size/opacity settings, and widescreen support. Some UI/UX improvements, more variations for end-of-day manor descriptions and accompanying house illustrations, HUD display customization, final room/item balancing, and the addition of a handful of extra cinematics that I am still working on (the unlockable challenge modes actually have their own unique openings and endings!)</p></blockquote><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">However, Ros notes that there will be bug-fixing patches released &#8220;intermittently&#8221; in the &#8220;months leading up to 1.10.&#8221; Ros says that some updates may include some of the features listed for 1.1o: &#8220;we wouldn&#8217;t want to sit on accessibility features for months on end while we wait on cinematics!&#8221; And Ros says the team will be &#8220;continually&#8221; committed to fixing bugs &#8220;for far, far into the future.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The update released today, 1.04.5, includes a fix for a save rollback issue on PS5.</p></div>
