But that&#8217;s unlikely to be the case this summer when tent camping at a music festival or road-tripping into the great unknown. That&#8217;s where BougeRV&#8217;s battery-powered shower comes in. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bougerv.com%2Fproducts%2Fportable-propane-outdoor-water-heater" rel="sponsored">$310 &#8220;Portable Propane Outdoor Camping Water Heater&#8221; from BougeRV</a> is not only optimized for search engine discovery, it also delivers a luxurious spray of hot steaming water to the unwashed, be they human, canine, or stubborn pots and pans. Charge up the battery, attach a propane canister, drop the pump into a jug of water, and you&#8217;re ready to get sudsing.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s so useful and flexible that I&#8217;ve ditched my plans to install a permanent shower cabin and expensive hot water system inside my adventure van, even if I don&#8217;t completely trust it.</p><p class="_16zyrvq1">8</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 310</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Battery-powered portability</li><li>Temperature control</li><li>Adjustable flow to save water</li><li>Lots of safety features</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>Lots of hoses and cables to snag</li><li>Weak shower head holder</li><li>No bag to carry all the accessories</li><li>Longevity concerns</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nemoequipment.com%2Fproducts%2Fhelio-pressure-shower" rel="sponsored">My current portable shower</a> consists of an 11-liter water bag, a manual foot pump, and a spray nozzle. To make it hot, I have to heat water on the stove or hang the bag in the sun for several hours, yet it still costs over $150. For $310, the BougeRV heated shower seems like a bargain.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The BougeRV system can produce a maximum heat output of 20,500 BTUs &#8212; about half of a typical residential gas water heater. It measures 15.75 x 6.7 x 14.57 inches (40 x 17 x 31cm) and weighs 13.2 pounds (6.21kg), making it compact and fairly lightweight with two big handles for easy carry. The hoses and cabling make it a little unwieldy &#8212; capable of chaos inside a small space unless handled with care.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Assembly starts with screwing in an easy to find one pound (454g) propane canister that attaches at the rear of the unit. That&#8217;s the size BougeRV recommends, but you wouldn&#8217;t be the first to instead run a hose from your RV&#8217;s existing propane tank to the pressure regulator on the water heater. Two quick-connect water hoses &#8212; labeled blue and red for idiot-proof attachment &#8212; route the water from your chosen receptacle, through that gas furnace, and out through the showerhead. The long 2.5m (8.2 feet) shower hose allows for flexible placement of the heater.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The small water pump measures just 2.24 inches (5.7cm) across, so it easily fits through the opening of standard jerry cans. The pump is electrically powered by the BougeRV unit, which is powered by its rechargeable battery, an AC wall jack, or 12V adapter that plugs into the cigarette jack of your vehicle or <a href="/2024/6/24/24182250/ecoflow-delta-pro-3-price-specs-blackout-generator-van-rv">solar</a> <a href="/2025/1/8/24334029/bluetti-apex-portable-energypro-home-backup-specs">generator</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The 2500mAh / 12V (30Wh) integrated Lithium-ion battery takes about three hours to charge from the included charger. A full battery and one-pound (454g) canister of liquid propane gas can pump out about an hour&#8217;s worth of hot water before both run dry. The shower&#8217;s gas consumption rate is 20MJ/h. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Alternatively, you can save gas with a long press on the pump button to put the shower into cold water mode &#8212; ideal for rinsing off your mountain bike, hiking shoes, or wet suit, for example.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The dial on the front of the heater controls the size of the flame. I did a handful of tests, starting with water measuring between 13 and 16 degrees Celsius (55&#8211;61 degrees Fahrenheit) according to the display on the BougeRV water heater. With the dial turned all the way to the left, the water pouring from the shower head rose to 23&#8211;25C (73&#8211;77F) after just a few seconds. Turned all the way to the right, the temperature maxed out at a steamy 34&#8211;41C (93&#8211;105F) in about 30 seconds.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">Recycling the water can make it even hotter, if you dare</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Recycling the water can make it even hotter, if you dare. After two or three cycles on max, the heater boosted the temperature above 51C (124F) before the unit shut down with an error, by design. It&#8217;s not meant to exceed an average water temperature above 50C (122F). A simple on/off reset the E6 error.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Water flow is between 2.2 and 3 liters per minute &#8212; well below what you can expect from a 9 to 12 L/min flow of a modern home shower. That&#8217;s still acceptable, in my opinion, and far superior to nothing, which is the typical alternative when camping away from home. The shower head has a rocker switch to toggle between hardish, mixed, and soft water flow rates as well as an on/off limiter button to help conserve water between lathers.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s surprisingly quiet even with the pump turned on. There&#8217;s some rapid clicking to ignite the gas (followed by a whoosh of flame) whenever the flow of water returns, and the pump produces a low-level hum that&#8217;s quickly drowned out by the sound of spraying water.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The water heater is also protected from tilts, bumps, and an empty water source. When I leaned my review unit over about 30 degrees, the unit shut off. It also shut off automatically after two minutes of trying to pump from an empty bucket. A master override on/off switch on the button prevents the unit from turning on accidentally if the on/off button on the front is bumped during transport or storage.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I&#8217;m impressed by BougeRV&#8217;s water heater, but I&#8217;m a little concerned about its durability over time. After using it on the beach on a windy day, I ran into trouble once I returned inside: the heater didn&#8217;t heat and the water was reduced to a trickle out of the showerhead. It&#8217;s possible that some sediment trapped in the lines reduced the flow rate below the 1.2L/min required for ignition. Nevertheless, the issue was resolved after a few minutes of fiddling with the hoses and filters, and turning the unit on and off again. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">BougeRV offers a two-year warranty and says the water heater is rated at IPX4. So while it&#8217;s resistant to splashing water, there&#8217;s no assurance offered against dust and blowing sand. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I do have a few other gripes. Those hoses can be a tripping and snagging hazard, and the plastic clip meant to hold the showerhead to one of the lifting handles is too weak to keep it from rotating and spraying your surroundings. I also wish BougeRV bundled the heater with an accessory bag to carry all the power adapters and hoses. And when putting the device away, you have to tip it forward to drain all the collected water from the inlet and outlet &#8212; there&#8217;s no automatic expulsion mechanism.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But really, these are trivial issues for what the unit does at this price.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Prior to this review, I had been in the late planning stages of having a shower cabin, water pump, gas heater, extra-large water tank, and all necessary plumbing installed in my Sprinter van. Total cost: about $4,000. I&#8217;m now convinced that a portable system like what BougeRV offers is a better option. Why pay so much for something so permanent that&#8217;s only used a few minutes each week, for maybe half the year?</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Instead, BougeRV&#8217;s $310 portable water heater can function as an outdoor shower during the summer months or be moved inside (with ventilation) when coupled with a <a href="https://50gradnord.com/en/collections/mobile-waschbecken-reisehygiene">portable shower curtain</a> and basin, all for less than $600. That sounds like a better use of my money, and probably yours if you&#8217;re an aspiring vanlifer.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">And when the van is parked, I can bring those hot (or cold) jets of water anywhere my adventures might take me: to clean up after mountain biking in the muddy forest or kitesurfing in the salty sea, to wash the dog outside after rolling in shit again, or to take a refreshing shower during a sweaty four-day music festival.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _17nnmdya _1xwtict1">A near-identical water heater is sold under the <a href="https://ranein.net/products/ranein-portable-water-heater-for-camping-propane-on-demand-camp-water-heater-with-4000mah-1-5h-rechargeable-built-in-battery-compact-outdoor-instant-hot-shower-heater">Ranien</a> and <a href="https://camplux.com/products/camplux-portable-propane-outdoor-camping-water-heater?srsltid=AfmBOopOXyo6qEinRTm2Qop4hd28EqGqO_O1vrOtjUF0-gzWEDVWdKxd">Camplux</a> brands, but those have larger 4000mAh (48Wh) batteries and list for between $349 and $399. So it might pay to shop around.</p></div>
