excerpt: Google I/O starts today, and would you believe it? They&#8217;re going to
  talk about AI. After getting everything Android out of the way in last week&#8217;s
  dedicated Android Show, we&#8217;re expecting today&#8217;s I/O developer conference
  keynote to be one big AI show. Gemini, Project Astra, and everything in between
  are likely to be the focus [&#8230;]
