<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Bungie has issued a statement on social media saying <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262">it is investigating how unauthorized artwork</a> appeared in the closed alpha test of its PvPvE shooter Marathon. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Earlier this week, Scottish artist Fern Hook posted on social media that her work had appeared in the Marathon alpha without her knowledge or permission. &#8220;Its environments are covered with assets lifted from poster designs I made in 2017,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">Hook wrote on X</a>. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/05/16/marathon-playstation-bungie-video-game/">an interview with the Washington Post</a>, Fern says she was suspicious that her art may have been used without her permission when Bungie first revealed the game in 2023. In her thread, Fern posted side-by-side comparisons of her work and what appears in Marathon. She also made a post on X in 2024 saying that she <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1798098416314265905">hid a reference to the Ctrl + Alt + Del webcomic &#8220;Loss&#8221; in her designs</a>. A year later, a player posted a screenshot from the game that includes a coded reference to the comic.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Bungie says that it was made aware of the issue and determined the art team did not know the artwork was stolen and that a former employee was responsible for adding the assets. The studio also said it reached out to Fern to discuss the matter and that it is, &#8220;committed to doing right by the artist.&#8221; </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">This is not the first time an artist&#8217;s work has been used for a Bungie product without their permission. In 2024, Bungie agreed to compensate the artist Tofu Rabbit after she discovered that the design for a Destiny 2-themed Nerf Gun <a href="/2024/9/13/24243893/destiny-2-nerf-ace-of-spades-stole-artists-work">was ripped directly from her fanart</a>. Bungie has also been accused of using other creators&#8217; Destiny 2 fanart for references and cutscenes without permission.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Bungie says it&#8217;s reviewing its in-game assets especially those done by former employees to ensure this won&#8217;t happen again (or again, or again).</p></div>
