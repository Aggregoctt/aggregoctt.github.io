<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Wireless charging is slower and less efficient than plugging in a wire, but it&#8217;s certainly convenient &#8212; especially when you add magnets. Most people who have an <a href="/2024/4/2/24119203/apple-iphone-12-qi2-support-ios-update">iPhone 12 or later</a> (except the <a href="/news/615435/the-iphone-16e-doesnt-have-magsafe-charging">16E</a>) and want a magnetic charger should get a Qi2 charger. Any Qi2-certified charger will charge a MagSafe iPhone up to 15W &#8212; just as fast as MagSafe on any phone but the <a href="/2024/9/9/24240184/apple-iphone-16-pro-25-watt-magsafe-charging">25W-capable iPhone 16</a>. Qi2 chargers are also less expensive than MagSafe-certified ones, and there are many more options. And unlike MagSafe, <a href="/2023/11/15/23961310/qi2-magnetic-wireless-charging-open-standard-certification">Qi2 is an open standard</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">All of Samsung&#8217;s <a href="/reviews/604154/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-ai-screen-battery">Galaxy S25-series phones</a> &#8212; including the <a href="/samsung/664844/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-thin-phone-price-release-date-impressions">new S25 Edge</a> &#8212; are &#8220;<a href="/2025/1/22/24349478/the-s25-phones-dont-have-qi2-but-they-are-qi2-ready">Qi2 Ready</a>,&#8221; which means they don&#8217;t have the magnets, but they can charge up to 15W on a Qi2 charger when paired with a <a href="https://jpsapi.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products/qi">Qi2 Ready magnetic case</a>. While it&#8217;s disappointing that Samsung didn&#8217;t include Qi2 in the phones themselves, most people use a case, so this feels like a small price to pay for access to the huge ecosystem of Qi2 accessories. If you use Android and like the sound of Qi2, we expect Google and others to release more Qi2-compatible phones <a href="/2025/1/6/24337323/more-android-phones-qi2-ready-certification-wireless-magnetic-charging-ces-2025">later this year</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Qi2 adds some much-needed simplicity to the magnetic charging ecosystem. The options that once consisted of MagSafe-certified chargers (made or licensed by Apple, capable of 15W charging on iPhones) and &#8220;MagSafe-compatible&#8221; chargers (made by third parties, capable of 7.5W charging on iPhones) are now being replaced by Qi2.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Unless you can get a great deal or you have an iPhone 16, the only MagSafe-certified charger still worth considering is <a href="/2024/9/9/24240184/apple-iphone-16-pro-25-watt-magsafe-charging">Apple&#8217;s improved puck</a>. The 16-series iPhones can charge up to 25W on the new charger and the new charger only. The new charger is also Qi2-certified, so it&#8217;s worth considering for once. </p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Featured in this article</h2><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 49</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">Apple&#8217;s updated MagSafe Charger is the only model that can currently supply up to 25W power to iPhone 16 series phones.

The original Qi phones fall back to 5W charging on Qi2 but can charge up to 10W with a regular Qi charger, while Qi2 Ready phones can charge up to 15W when paired with the proper magnet case and charger.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Confused? Check out the table below that summarizes these charging speed nuances, and read on for our favorites of the Qi2 and MagSafe pucks, stands, 3-in-1 chargers, and battery packs we&#8217;ve tested so far.</p><h2 class="_10m8eym3">MagSafe / Qi2 Maximum charge rates</h2><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Charger type</h3><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">iPhone 16 and 16 Pro</h3><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">iPhone 12 - 15</h3><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Non-Qi2 phones</h3>New Apple MagSafe / Qi2 chargerUp to 25WUp to 15W5WQi2Up to 15WUp to 15W5WMagSafe-certifiedUp to 15WUp to 15W (12W for Minis)less than 5W (Apple being Apple)MagSafe-compatible / Qi with magnetsUp to 7.5WUp to 7.5WUp to 10W<h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd91">What we&#8217;re looking for</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">The Qi2 certification ensures not just proper 15W charging, but also the strength and position of the alignment magnets. Anybody can slap a ring of magnets around a cheap Qi coil and call it MagSafe-compatible, but if it isn&#8217;t certified, you won&#8217;t get more than 7.5W charging from it, and there&#8217;s no guarantee that the magnets will be strong enough. MagSafe certification is fine too, but MagSafe chargers tend to be more expensive than Qi2, aren&#8217;t compatible with non-iPhones, and (with the exception of the new one) aren&#8217;t any faster than Qi2.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Does it include the AC adapter? Is the cable long enough? Can it charge more than one device?</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Does the charger travel easily, or is it best left in one spot to never move?</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Is it janky or refined? Does it have clever design elements or bonus features?</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Does this charger offer a better value than most, or at least justify its price?</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Best for the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro</h2><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MagSafe-Charger-Capability-Compatible/dp/B0DGHHJXTC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple MagSafe Charger (2m)</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 49</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 49</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">0 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 49</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">Apple&#8217;s updated magnetic charging puck is available in two sizes, 1m and 2m, and supports 15W MagSafe / Qi2 charging as well as 25W charging on the iPhone 16 only.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Certification:</strong> MagSafe, Qi2 / <strong>Wireless charge output:</strong> 25W (iPhone 16), 15W (Qi2) / <strong>Cable length:</strong> 6.6ft / 2m / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>AC adapter included:</strong> no / <strong>Warranty:</strong> One year</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">While Qi2 is as fast as MagSafe on the iPhones 12 through 15, Apple has moved the goalposts with the iPhone 16 generation. The new phones can charge at up to 25W <a href="/2024/9/9/24240184/apple-iphone-16-pro-25-watt-magsafe-charging">with the updated MagSafe Charger</a> &#8212; making it the best choice for owners of the latest iPhone. It&#8217;s great to see faster wireless charging, but it does mean you&#8217;re again incentivized to buy Apple&#8217;s puck over cheaper, more widely available Qi2 options.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">For once, there&#8217;s good reason to consider the Apple puck. It&#8217;s Qi2-certified as well as MagSafe, so it&#8217;ll work with non-Apple Qi2 devices, should those materialize. And the company has finally added a version with a 2m / 6.6ft cable instead of only offering a too-short 1m / 3.3ft one. Get the longer one. You&#8217;ll also need an AC adapter since it doesn&#8217;t come with one. Both <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-iPhone-Included/dp/B0B2MM1W65?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Anker</a> and Nomad, among others, have options that are smaller and cheaper than Apple&#8217;s USB-C chargers. Nomad&#8217;s, in particular, has a <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/products/ac-adapter-35w-usb-c-slim-white" rel="sponsored">nice, flat design</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8212; Antonio G.

If you just want a basic puck, we like Anker&#8217;s MagGo Qi2 wireless charging pad. Its five-foot cable is shorter than the 6.6-foot one on Apple&#8217;s new MagSafe charger, but it&#8217;s also $20 cheaper. When you consider that Anker includes an AC adapter and Apple doesn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s more like $40 cheaper. Unless you have an iPhone 16 and really want that 25W charging, the Anker Qi2 puck is a better value.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8212; Antonio G.

It plugs into the 12V (the &#8220;cigarette lighter&#8221;) port and has an integrated coiled 30W USB-C cable, which I use for the ESR Qi2 charger, plus another 30W USB-C PD port, a USB-A port, and the aforementioned Bluetooth FM transmitter. Honestly, a killer deal.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">There are a ton of Qi2 car mounts out there, and we have a few more in the queue, but this one&#8217;s good!</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8212; Nathan Edwards</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Other chargers worth considering</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Now that Qi2 is widely available, it&#8217;s a safe bet that you&#8217;re at least getting something decent if it&#8217;s Qi2-certified and it&#8217;s from a reputable brand.

If there&#8217;s a Qi2 charger from one of them that seems like a good fit for your particular needs and your budget, it&#8217;s likely worth a shot. When in doubt, know the retailer&#8217;s return policy and the manufacturer&#8217;s warranty if it ends up not being to your liking.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Update, May 21st: </strong>Adjusted pricing / availability for several options and noted that the new Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge also supports Qi2 charging when paired with the proper case.</p></div>
