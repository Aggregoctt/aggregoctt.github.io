<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">When it comes to finding a device to read ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on X. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its ever-expanding Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. The bulk of the devices function as simple ebook readers; however, with the <a href="/2024/12/28/24328287/amazon-kindle-scribe-2024-e-reader-notetaking-pen-review">Kindle Scribe</a>, Amazon is moving beyond books and into the realm of writing &#8212; something that should make future Kindles function more akin to physical paper.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Below, we&#8217;ve listed each model currently available. Sometimes there isn&#8217;t a deal for one or even any of the products, but in those cases, we&#8217;ve listed the most recent sale price.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best Kindle (2024) deals</h2><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">What does it mean when a Kindle is &#8220;ad-supported&#8221;?</h3><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1 kuxlcj7">Amazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when it is in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In case you missed it, Amazon<a href="/2024/10/16/24271197/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-e-reader-12th-gen-2024"> announced a new entry-level Kindle</a> in October, one that was designed to replace the outgoing <a href="/23409106/amazon-kindle-2022-e-reader-review-test-price-specs-features">2022 model</a>. The latest Kindle &#8212; which starts at $109.99 &#8212; boasts a brighter 94-nit display, improved contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns. It also comes in a &#8220;matcha&#8221; green instead of &#8220;denim,&#8221; just in case you&#8217;re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it&#8217;s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In the past, Amazon&#8217;s newest ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $84.99 ($25 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited. Right now, however, you can only buy the base Kindle at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNV9F72P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Famazon-kindle-16-gb-2024-black%2F6599466.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-6-e-reader-2024%2F-%2FA-93604795%3Fpreselect%3D91563144%23lnk%3Dsametab" rel="sponsored">Target</a> for its full retail price of $109.99. </p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle/dp/B0CNV9F72P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kindle (2024)</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 110</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 110</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">Amazon&#8217;s new entry-level Kindle retains a six-inch, 300ppi display and USB-C. It&#8217;s both brighter and faster than its predecessor, however, and features longer battery life.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best Kindle Kids (2024) deals</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Amazon also updated its kid-friendly Kindle in late 2024. The new Kindle Kids is identical to the standard model but comes with several accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $129.99.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In terms of add-ons, the new Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a protective case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. The last feature is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns and lack of ads, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books &#8212; including those in the Percy Jackson and Harry Potter series &#8212; at no additional cost.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In the past, we&#8217;ve seen the latest Kindle Kids sell for as low as $94.99 ($35 off).

Considering it&#8217;s one of the company&#8217;s higher-end configurations, it offers all the features found in the entry-level Kindle, including USB-C charging and a crisp 300ppi display. It&#8217;s noticeably faster than Amazon&#8217;s base ebook reader and features IPX8 waterproofing, a larger seven-inch display, and longer battery life.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In the past, we&#8217;ve seen the standard Paperwhite drop to as low as $129.99.

It&#8217;s identical to the standard Kindle Paperwhite, with the same waterproof design and sharp, seven-inch display. However, like the Kindle Kids, the e-reader is free of ads and offers parental controls you can turn off.

It packs a 10.2-inch display with 300ppi resolution, along with the same great battery life for which Kindles are known. What separates the Scribe from other Kindles, however, is that it comes with a stylus, which can be used to jot down notes or doodle in the ebook reader&#8217;s built-in notebook. With the latest Scribe, Amazon also introduced a new Active Canvas feature, so you can scribble notes directly on ebook pages, as well as a suite of AI-powered features that can summarize your notes and refine your handwriting.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Right now, there are no discounts available on the standalone entry-level Kindle Scribe, though Amazon is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/promotion/psp/A26VU63WORDFOP?ref=psp_pc_cart_collapse&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">offering a $40 discount</a> when you purchase two.

Like the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, it boasts a seven-inch display with a crisp 300ppi resolution, IPX8 water resistance, wireless charging, and 32GB of storage. However, unlike the Paperwhite, the e-reader offers a color mode, which cuts the resolution in half. Thankfully, it&#8217;s still vibrant for a color E-Ink screen despite the lower resolution, rendering it particularly ideal for reading comic books and manga.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In the past, we&#8217;ve seen the Kindle Colorsoft drop to as low as $224.99 ($55 off), but right now there are no discounts available on the standalone e-reader.
