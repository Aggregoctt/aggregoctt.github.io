Unlike the dozens of other robot vacuums that Gus happily lets clean around him while he sleeps, the Z70 keeps stealing his treasures. Not his dog toys &#8212; although that could be a future feature &#8212; but my family&#8217;s socks that he loves to collect and carry around the house with him. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Since the Z70 arrived, he&#8217;s had competition. The first robot vacuum with a mechanical arm, the Z70 features a five-axis arm, branded the OmniGrip, that uses onboard sensors and a camera to see, pick up, and tidy away a small list of light items, including the aforementioned socks, footwear such as slippers and sandals, tissues, and paper. In theory, this means I should spend less time picking up after my kids or rummaging in Gus&#8217; bed to find the socks he&#8217;s stolen. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In practice, it&#8217;s nowhere near achieving this goal. Yes, the arm can pick up items and put them away, which is seriously impressive. It collected my son&#8217;s discarded socks and a few balls of paper, putting them where I asked it to. But the Z70&#8217;s limitations are deal-breakers at this point, and its lack of consistency also lets it down.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">For example, while the bot would detect footwear, it nearly always opted not to pick up any shoes, only once retrieving a slipper or sandal of its own volition. It also consistently struggled to place more than one item in the correct spot each time it cleaned. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Still, this is the first consumer robot vacuum to venture into appendage territory, and even in this beta-like stage, it&#8217;s remarkable. But for an eye-watering $2,599, the Saros Z70 needs to pick up more than a few socks.</p><p class="_16zyrvq1">5</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 2599</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Picks up smelly socks</li><li>Great vacuum and mop</li><li>Excellent navigation</li><li>Automatically removes its mops</li><li>Low profile gets under most furniture</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>Twenty-six hundred dollars</li><li>Fails to pick up most shoes</li><li>Can&#8217;t see items on carpet</li><li>Sometimes misses its target</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Saros Z70 is a flagship robot vacuum that&#8217;s a big step up from my <a href="/24141479/roborock-s8-maxv-ultra-vs-dreame-x30-ultra-robot-vacuum-mop">current top pick floor sweeper, the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra</a>. With over twice the suction power, a more advanced navigation and obstacle detection system, and dual spinning mops that it can automatically remove, it&#8217;s an impressive cleaner.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">However, aside from the arm, it&#8217;s essentially the same vacuum as <a href="/2025/1/5/24332998/roborock-saros-z70-robot-vacuum-omnigrip-arm#:~:text=Realistically%2C%20as%20cool,when%20not%20needed.">the $1,599.99 Saros 10R</a> that launched with it earlier this year &#8212; with a few modifications made to accommodate the mechanism, including a different roller brush and a smaller onboard bin and water tank. For $1,000 less, the 10R is a better bet right now.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">While cleaning my house, the Saros Z70 used an AI-powered camera on the front of the robot to identify potential pickable objects, then returned to &#8220;sort&#8221; them. This process, which was very slow, involved scrutinizing the object for a few moments, then shuffling around, pausing to unfold the arm from the body of the robot, extending it, twisting it horizontally or vertically, and using its pincer grip to grab the item.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">A camera in the &#8220;hand&#8221; sees the item and determines how to pick it up, then a grip sensor measures the weight of the object &#8212; 300 grams (0.66 pounds) is the max. Sensors along the arm also detect if anything is in the way, to stop it pinching an object or banging into something. At one point, it tried to pick up a rug tassel, realized it was too heavy, and let it go.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">When it did manage to pick something up, it&#8217;d hoist the object high into the air and triumphantly carry it toward the zone I&#8217;d designated in the app. Socks or paper went into a Roborock-provided bin, with about an 80 percent success rate. The robot always dropped stuff, just not always in the bin. Sometimes just alongside it, and once or twice, when it got confused, absolutely nowhere near it. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Footwear was supposed to go to the shoe storage area, but it only managed to pick up one sandal during my testing, studiously avoiding the slippers, flip-flops, and Crocs I left strewn around. Even then, it deposited the sandal just outside the shoe storage zone.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Roborock suggested trying the manual control option in the app, which gives a live view from the camera on the arm to see if the bot could accurately identify and pick up one of the shoes it had been ignoring. This worked on the flip-flop, with the arm picking it up when directed. It just wouldn&#8217;t do it autonomously. (Sidenote: The camera in the arm can be used as a roaming home security camera, providing an additional vantage point to the forward-facing one.)</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Z70 did a good job with large socks, small fabric toys that looked like socks, and paper, but it didn&#8217;t like small socks. However, in most cleaning runs, it only picked up one or two items, even if there were half a dozen shoes and socks scattered around.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It also can&#8217;t pick up items on carpet, so those socks my husband slipped off and hid under the coffee table while watching telly will go untidied. Speaking of tables, the arm can&#8217;t reach under low furniture; if it detects anything above it within 45cm (17.7 inches), it won&#8217;t deploy its arm.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">All of this illustrates the technology&#8217;s promise versus its current reality. The robot uses AI to identify obstacles and determine whether to avoid them (like pet poop), clean around them (like cables), or pick them up. The logs in the app revealed that its success was comparable to that of a preschooler using flashcards. On one run, it identified the black flip-flop as a cable, a piece of paper as a plastic bag, and a brown slipper as pet poop. But on the next run, it picked up the same ball of paper with no issues. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">The arm is an impressive novelty, but not functional enough to be worth your money</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Today, the arm is an impressive novelty, but not functional enough to be worth your money. However, the hardware feels solid, and if the software can be improved, it could be very useful.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I&#8217;m constantly picking up and relocating footwear that my family discards, and having a robot do it reliably would make my life easier, not to mention help with the Monday morning panic when we can&#8217;t find my daughter&#8217;s Crocs. If it could pick up larger items like clothes, deal with phone charging cables, and other common household clutter, I&#8217;d love to set it loose on my teenage kids&#8217; rooms to tidy up before cleaning.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Specs: Saros Z70</h2><ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1ymtmqpi _11h7yix0 _1xwtict1 kuxlcj7"><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Price</strong>: $2,600</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Suction</strong>: 22,000Pa</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Brushes</strong>: Single &#8220;freeflow&#8221; rubber/bristle brush</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Mopping</strong>: Dual spinning mop pads, auto removal, 22mm mop lift, warm water mopping</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Battery capacity:</strong> 6,400 mAh, 2.5-hour fast charging</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Obstacle detection:</strong> Recognizes 108 objects</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Navigation</strong>: <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.roborock.com%2Fpages%2Froborock-starsight-autonomous-system%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopeLu1UJ3C2aY8wzR7uzz9zTGnfDh4DDxspZh922Yl_3HVuLLKp&amp;xcust=__vg0520awD__669555__________________platform.theverge.com" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored" target="_blank">StarSight 2.0 navigation system</a></span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Height</strong>: 3.14 inches (7.98 cm)</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Dock</strong>: Auto-empty, dual water tanks, detergent dispenser, hot water washing, hot air drying</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Voice control</strong>: Built-in Rocky voice assistant</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Smart home</strong> <strong>control</strong>: Matter (including Apple Home, Samsung SmartThings), Amazon Alexa, Google Home</span></li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Roborock claims to have a slew of updates in the works for the bot, beginning next month, which it says should improve reliability and expand its object repertoire, crucially to heavier items like sneakers. The bot is currently limited to 300 grams (0.66 pounds) but is capable of handling up to 700 grams (1.5 pounds), according to Roborock.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Hopefully, this will make the arm more confident when picking up footwear. Currently, it&#8217;s very specific about what it will collect, largely as a safety feature. It did pick up the occasional small cat toy and stuffed animal, but mostly opted against trying to grasp an item if there was any doubt. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Speaking of safety, both Gus and my cat, Boone, tried playing with the arm, and it immediately stopped moving, so I felt confident that they were safe. The arm is also surprisingly sturdy, although I&#8217;m not sure it would hold up to 70-pound Gus if he were determined to retrieve a sock. (There is an emergency stop button for the arm should something go wrong.)</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Arm issues aside, the Saros Z70 excels as a robot vacuum.

Probably. With the speed of innovation in home robotics, a Rosie the Robot-like autonomous cleaning machine in our homes is starting to feel less like science fiction.
