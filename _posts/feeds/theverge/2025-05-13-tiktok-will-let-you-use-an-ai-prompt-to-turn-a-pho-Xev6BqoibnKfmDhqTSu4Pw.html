<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">TikTok has a new AI-powered tool called &#8220;AI Alive&#8221; that will let you turn photos into video with a prompt to describe what you want the video to look like. It&#8217;s a little different from other </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">You can access the tool from TikTok&#8217;s Story Camera, and it uses &#8220;intelligent editing tools that give anyone, regardless of editing experience, the ability to transform static images into captivating, short-form videos enhanced with movement, atmospheric and creative effects,&#8221; <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-tiktok-ai-alive">according to a blog post</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I tested the tool with a few pictures from my camera roll. After picking the photo, I could enter a prompt; TikTok initially filled the prompt box with &#8220;make this photo come alive.&#8221; Uploading usually took a few minutes, though the videos themselves were just a few seconds long. It also failed to make a picture where I asked it to make a cat jump and have an anime style into an anime.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">TikTok says it has some safety measures in place for the videos. &#8220;To help prevent people from creating content that violates our policies, moderation technology reviews the uploaded photo and written AI generation prompt as well as the AI Alive video before it&#8217;s shown to the creator,&#8221; TikTok says in the blog post. &#8220;A final safety check happens once a creator decides to post to their Story.&#8221; The video will also be labeled as AI-generated and will have <a href="/2024/8/21/24223932/c2pa-standard-verify-ai-generated-images-content-credentials">C2PA</a> metadata embedded.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Let&#8217;s hope this tool doesn&#8217;t add in brand new people, like what has happened <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sieraamisst24/video/7503358249031224622">with TikTok&#8217;s AI &#8220;sway dance&#8221; filter</a>.</p></div>
