And also HBO Now. But now it&#8217;s HBO Max, except wait, now it&#8217;s not HBO at all? It&#8217;s just Max? Actually, I&#8217;m being told <a href="/news/666707/hbo-max-returning-rebrand-warner-bros-discovery">it is once again HBO Max</a>. Thank you for joining us on this wild and utterly nonsensical branding journey. Please keep watching The White Lotus. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of The Vergecast</a>, Nilay, David, and The Verge&#8217;s <a href="/authors/jacob-kastrenakes">Jake Kastrenakes</a> start the show with some personal news before digging into Warner Bros. Discovery&#8217;s decision to rename its streaming service again this week, re-embracing the HBO brand after <a href="/news/667047/hbo-max-rebrand-criticism">eschewing it only a few years ago</a>. (Now that we think about it, maybe we should have seen this coming from a company that couldn&#8217;t come up with a better combined name than &#8220;Warner Bros. Discovery.&#8221;) The hosts also talk about the rest of the news in a busy week in streaming, from <a href="/news/666019/espn-standalone-subscription-service-price-disney-plus-hulu">ESPN&#8217;s upcoming service</a> to the <a href="/news/664913/fox-sports-news-streaming-service-nfl-season-launch">plan for Fox One</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong><strong>Subscribe: <a href="https://bit.ly/40Nhvbe">Spotify</a> | <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-vergecast/id430333725">Apple </a><a href="https://bit.ly/3R97G3Z">Podcasts</a> | <a href="https://bit.ly/3WSgkWW">Overcast</a> | <a href="https://bit.ly/4hMo2db">Pocket Casts</a> | <a href="https://bit.ly/3hkwRl2">More</a></strong></strong></p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">After that, it&#8217;s time to talk gadgets. Apple&#8217;s next-generation CarPlay, <a href="/news/667525/apple-carplay-ultra-aston-martin-launch">now called CarPlay Ultra</a>, is finally here, but it&#8217;s not at all <a href="/2024/6/17/24180353/apple-carplay-wireless-system-features">what we expected</a>. Google revealed the <a href="/news/664316/android-material-three-expressive-design-ui-io">colorful, bouncy future of Android</a>, and we really like it &#8212; but we&#8217;re not sure who&#8217;s actually going to get to see it. Ahead of Google I/O next week, we have plenty of questions about what&#8217;s next for Google&#8217;s phone plans, and for Gemini in general.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Finally, in the lightning round, it&#8217;s time for another edition of Brendan Carr is a Dummy. We also talk about the strange, <a href="/news/667562/wbd-storyverse-the-matrix-friends-harry-potter">uncanny future of sponsored content</a> &#8212; and why &#8220;the Oscar goes to&#8230; Coca-Cola!&#8221; is a sentence we might need to get ready to hear. And we discuss <a href="/news/666191/airbnb-new-app-services-experiences">the new Airbnb</a>, and whether the company&#8217;s pivot to experiences and services will actually pay off.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, beginning with streaming:</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">And in Android and CarPlay news:</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">And in the lightning round:&#8217;</p></div>
