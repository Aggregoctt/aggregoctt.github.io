  this week that limited mentions of "Palestine," "Gaza," and "Genocide" in email
  subject lines or in the body of a message. Nisreen Jaradat, a senior tech support
  engineer at Microsoft, emailed thousands of employees on May 23rd with the subject

  protest

<div><blockquote class="duet--article--blockquote ewrhy30 _1xwtict9"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Yesterday, Microsoft chose to utterly and completely discriminate against an entire nation, an entire people, and an entire community by blocking all employees from sending any outbound email containing the words &#8220;Palestine&#8221;, &#8220;Gaza&#8221;, &#8220;genocide&#8221;, or &#8220;apartheid&#8221;. Microsoft leaders justified this blatant censorship by saying it was to prevent you from receiving emails like the email that you are reading right now. Even though Microsoft SLT are aware that this &#8220;short term solution&#8221; is easily bypassable, as this email clearly proves, Microsoft still doubled down, insisted on not rolling back the policy, and decided to continue targeting and repressing their Palestinian, Arab, Muslim, and allied workers. They refused to revoke this censorship tactic, despite its potential illegality, dozens of employees expressing how racist of a decision it was, and even leaders admitting they see how it can be perceived as discriminatory and targeted. This further proves how little Microsoft values Palestinian lives and Palestinian suffering.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">As a Palestinian worker, I am fed up with the way our people have been treated by this company. I am sending this email as a message to Microsoft leaders: the cost of trying to silence all voices that dare to humanize Palestinians is far higher than simply listening to the concerns of your employees. Had this useless and discriminatory policy been revoked, as I tried to request numerous times through so-called &#8220;proper channels&#8221;[1][2], I would not be sending you all this email.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Despite claiming to have &#8220;heard concerns from our employees and the public regarding Microsoft technologies used by the Israeli military to target civilians or cause harm in the conflict in Gaza&#8221; in a statement riddled with lies, admissions, and absurd justifications, Microsoft has shown that they are utterly uninterested in hearing what we have to say.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Microsoft claims that they &#8220;provide many avenues for all voices to be heard&#8221;. However, whenever we try to discuss anything substantial about divesting from genocide in the &#8220;approved channels&#8221;, workers are retaliated against, doxxed, or silenced. Microsoft has deleted relevant employee questions in AMAs with executives and shut down Viva Engage posts in dedicated channels for asking SLT questions. Managers have warned outspoken directs to stay quiet and have even openly retaliated against them. When my community tries to flag issues and concerns to HR/GER/WIT, we have been met with racist outcomes with double standards. Throughout all this, Microsoft has sent a clear message to their employees: There are no proper channels at Microsoft to express your concerns, disagreements, or even questions about how Microsoft is using your labor to kill Palestinian babies.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Over this past week, Microsoft has shown their true face, brutalizing, detaining, firing, pepper spraying, threatening and insulting workers and former workers protesting at Microsoft Build. This email censorship is simply the latest example in a long list of recent extreme and outrageous escalations by Microsoft against my community. Enough is enough.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">It has become clear that Microsoft will not listen to us out of the goodness of their hearts.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Microsoft will not change their stance just because it is the moral or even legal thing to do. Microsoft will only divest from genocide once it becomes more expensive for them to kill Palestinians than not. Right now, Microsoft makes a lot of money from genocide-profiteering, so we must make support for genocide even more expensive.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">The situation in Palestine is more urgent by the minute. More and more Palestinians are being killed of starvation under the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF)&#8216;s bombing campaign, invasion, and siege that has martyred an estimated 400,000 Palestinians. The IOF have kidnapped over 16,000 Palestinians and placed them in torture and rape camps. 1.93 million Palestinians in Gaza have been displaced, and over 40,000 Palestinians have been displaced in the West Bank.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">While a hostile work environment is difficult, it cannot compare to the horrors taking place in Palestine - horrors that we as Microsoft employees are complicit in. These futile attempts to silence our community, while painful at times, are evidence that the pressure we are applying is working. This is not the time for baby steps or gradual progress. Starving infants cannot wait any longer. We, as a company of over 200,000 employees, are providing the technological backbone for Israel&#8217;s genocidal war machine in Palestinian. We, as employees of this company, have a responsibility to end our employer&#8217;s complicity in this AI-assisted genocide! Now is the time to escalate against Microsoft and end this Microsoft-powered genocide!</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">I am calling on every employee of conscience to:</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Sign No Azure for Apartheid&#8217;s petition calling for a termination of all Microsoft contracts with the Israeli military and government: <a target="_blank" href="https://noaa.cc/petition" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://noaa.cc/petition</a></p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Strongly consider whether you want to stay in the company and fight for change from within, or if you want to leave and stop contributing labor to genocide.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">If you choose to leave Microsoft to no longer be complicit in genocide, do not go quietly. The No Azure for Apartheid campaign is ready to help you make an impact on your way out for Palestine, and we will also do our best to provide you support before leaving. Reach out to us expressing your interest to leave here.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">If you choose to stay, continue to fight from the inside to end Microsoft&#8217;s, and your own, complicity in war crimes, join the No Azure for Apartheid campaign. If you are worried about being public with your affiliation, rest assured that as a worker-led grassroots movement, we have members with all levels of anonymity and risk level. Some of our members are publicly visible and will even publicly confront our war-criminal executives, such as Satya Nadella, Mustafa Suleyman, and Jay Parikh at major Microsoft events like the 50th Anniversary celebration and Microsoft Build. Other members choose to stay completely anonymous and still contribute to the critical work of the campaign. There is room for everyone: <a target="_blank" href="https://noaa.cc/join" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://noaa.cc/join</a></p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">While I do understand that as Microsoft employees, we cannot fully boycott Microsoft, most of us can focus on the priority targets set by the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement, which recently set Microsoft as a priority target. The main target of the boycott is Microsoft Gaming, especially X-Box. We can also encourage our friends and family to boycott Microsoft where possible.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">To Microsoft Senior Leadership team specifically:You cannot silence Palestine.You cannot silence Gaza.You cannot hide your involvement in genocide and apartheid.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Fre e PalestineNisreen Jaradat</p></blockquote></div>
