<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The May 18th issue of the Chicago Sun-Times features dozens of pages of recommended summer activities: new trends, outdoor activities, and books to read. But some of the recommendations point to fake, AI-generated books, and other articles quote and cite people that don&#8217;t appear to exist.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Alongside actual books like Call Me By Your Name by Andr&#233; Aciman, a summer reading list features fake titles by real authors. Min Jin Lee is a real, lauded novelist &#8212; but &#8220;Nightshade Market,&#8221; &#8220;a riveting tale set in Seoul&#8217;s underground economy,&#8221; isn&#8217;t one of her works. Rebecca Makkai, a Chicago local, is credited for a fake book called &#8220;Boiling Point&#8221; that the article claims is about a climate scientist whose teenage daughter turns on her.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In a post on Bluesky, the Sun-Times said it was &#8220;looking into how this made it into print,&#8221; noting that it wasn&#8217;t editorial content and wasn&#8217;t created or approved by the newsroom. Victor Lim, senior director of audience development, added in an email to The Verge that &#8220;it is unacceptable for any content we provide to our readers to be inaccurate,&#8221; saying more information will be provided soon. It&#8217;s not clear if the content is sponsored &#8212; the cover page for the section bears the Sun-Times logo and simply calls it &#8220;Your guide to the best of summer.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The book list appears without a byline, but a writer named Marco Buscaglia is credited for other pieces in the summer guide. Buscaglia&#8217;s byline appears on a story about hammock culture in the US that quotes several experts and publications, some of whom do not appear to be real. It references a 2023 Outside magazine article by Brianna Madia, a real author and blogger, that I was unable to find. The piece also cites an &#8220;outdoor industry market analysis&#8221; by Eagles Nest Outfitters that I was unable to find online. Also quoted is &#8220;Dr. Jennifer Campos, professor of leisure studies at the University of Colorado,&#8221; who does not appear to exist. Buscaglia did not immediately respond to a request for comment but <a href="https://www.404media.co/chicago-sun-times-prints-ai-generated-summer-reading-list-with-books-that-dont-exist/">admitted to 404 Media</a> that he uses AI &#8220;for background at times&#8221; and always checks the material. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;This time, I did not and I can&#8217;t believe I missed it because it&#8217;s so obvious. No excuses,&#8221; he told 404. &#8220;On me 100 percent and I&#8217;m completely embarrassed.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Another uncredited article titled &#8220;Summer food trends&#8221; features similar seemingly nonexistent experts, including a &#8220;Dr. Catherine Furst, food anthropologist at Cornell University.&#8221; Padma Lakshmi is also attributed in the piece for a quote she doesn&#8217;t appear to have said.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">News outlets have repeatedly run AI-generated content next to their actual journalism, often blaming the issue on third-party content creators. High-profile incidents of AI-generated content at <a href="/2023/10/26/23931530/gannett-ai-product-reviews-site-reviewed-union-newsguild">Gannett</a> and <a href="/2023/11/27/23978389/sports-illustrated-ai-fake-authors-advon-commerce-gannett-usa-today">Sports Illustrated</a> raised questions about the editorial process, and in both cases, <a href="/24195879/advon-commerce-ai-sports-illustrated-gannett-product-reviews-spam-seo">a third-party marketing firm</a> was behind the AI sludge. Newsrooms&#8217; defense is typically that they had nothing to do with the content &#8212; but the appearance of AI-generated work alongside real reporting and writing by human staffers damages trust all the same. </p></div>
