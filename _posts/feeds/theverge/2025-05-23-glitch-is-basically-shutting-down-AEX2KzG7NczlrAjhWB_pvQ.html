<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Glitch, the coding platform where developers can share and remix projects, will soon no longer offer its core feature: hosting apps on the web. In <a href="https://blog.glitch.com/post/changes-are-coming-to-glitch/">an update on Thursday</a>, Glitch CEO Anil Dash said it will stop hosting projects and close user profiles on July 8th, 2025 &#8212; but stopped short of saying that it&#8217;s shutting down completely.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Users will be able to access their dashboard and download code for their projects through the end of 2025, and Glitch is working on a new feature that allows users to redirect their project subdomains. The platform has also stopped taking new Pro subscriptions, but it will continue to honor existing subscriptions until July 8th.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Without these key features, it&#8217;s not clear what will be left of Glitch. When The Verge reached out to Dash for clarification, he said the dashboard, app redirects, and code download tools are the &#8220;only user features that we&#8217;ve confirmed availability&#8221; for after July 8th. &#8220;Anything else that we would have to share would come in a future update, but it&#8217;s just that very minimal feature set for now.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Dash <a href="/2017/3/14/14921528/glitch-new-coding-site-anil-dash-collaboration-remix-apps">launched Glitch in 2017</a> under Fog Creek Software, but it was <a href="/2022/5/19/23126349/glitch-fastly-acquired-coding-anil-dash-fog-creek">acquired by the cloud service provider</a> Fastly in 2022. In the blog post announcing the update, Dash said the time and money required to host apps &#8220;has greatly increased as the platform has gotten older and bad actors try to misuse the platform.&#8221; However, Dash tells The Verge the team is &#8220;still figuring out what plans might be possible for Glitch and its community going forward.&#8221;</p></div>
