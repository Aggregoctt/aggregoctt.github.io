<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday and Prime Day, many great iPad deals are attainable outside of those times. The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there&#8217;s often some amount to be saved, particularly on Apple&#8217;s more affordable iPads. The most recent iPad Pro and iPad Mini are also regularly discounted, as is the latest iPad Air.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you&#8217;re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that&#8217;s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we&#8217;ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is available, from the 10th-gen iPad of 2022 to the more powerful iPad models with M3 and M4 chips.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best <a href="/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados">iPad (2022)</a> deals</h2><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Blue-10th-Generation%2F1924288816" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple iPad (10th generation)</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 299</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 349</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">14 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 299</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">Apple&#8217;s 10th-gen iPad is the successor to the older ninth-gen model. In exchange for its revised design, landscape-oriented webcam, USB-C port, larger 10.9-inch screen, and faster processor, it ditched the headphone jack and home button.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Apple&#8217;s <a href="/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados"><strong>10th-gen iPad</strong></a> came out in late 2022. It&#8217;s still a great tablet overall; however, it&#8217;s recently been supplanted by <a href="/news/621625/apple-ipad-2024-launch-price-availability">Apple&#8217;s latest entry-level model</a>, which features an upgraded A16 chip and twice as much base storage. That said, the last-gen iPad still benefits from a modern design and Apple&#8217;s long-in-the-making switch to USB-C. The 10.9-inch tablet is also outfitted with a side power button with a fingerprint sensor and uniform bezels, though, unlike its predecessor, it lacks a home button and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Right now, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Blue-10th-Generation%2F1924288816" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> starting at $299 ($50 off), which is $40 more than its best price to date. <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Blue-10th-Generation%2F1497747190" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> are also selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi in select colors for just shy of $350 ($150 off), which is a better deal when you consider you can currently grab an 11th-gen iPad with an expanded 128GB of storage at Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display/dp/B0DZ77D5HL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">starting at $299</a> ($100 off).</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best <a href="/apple/636335/ipad-2025-11th-generation-review">iPad (2025)</a> deals</h2><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display/dp/B0DZ77D5HL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple iPad (11th-gen)</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 299</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 349</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">14 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 299</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">Apple&#8217;s 11th-gen iPad offers 128GB of storage &#8212; twice that of its predecessor &#8212; and runs on a faster A16 chip. It also comes in four colors: blue, pink, yellow, and silver.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As noted above, <strong>Apple&#8217;s 11th-gen iPad</strong> just recently landed on the scene. The <a href="/news/621625/apple-ipad-2024-launch-price-availability">new base-model tablet</a> is a fairly iterative update of the prior model with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and an A16 Bionic chip, which is nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip found in the 10th-gen iPad. The newer chip doesn&#8217;t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1. For that, you&#8217;ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Pricing-wise, the new iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We haven&#8217;t seen significant price drops yet, though the entry-level model is on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ77D5HL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2025-Apple-11-inch-iPad-A16-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Silver%2F15483805722" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> starting at $299 ($50 off) right now.

Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation&#8217;s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Right now, the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi is only on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3W6TV6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> for $474, which is a mere $15 discount.

It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence and compatibility with Apple&#8217;s latest Magic Keyboard, which has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys that make the Air a more credible laptop replacement.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 &#8212; the same price as the previous models &#8212; but we&#8217;re already starting to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76BN5D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1883562-REG%2Fapple_mc9x4ll_a_11_ipad_air_m3.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> in its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $529 ($20 off).
