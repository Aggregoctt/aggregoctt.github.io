<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Yesterday, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/weeks-after-amazons-alexa-ai-launch-mystery-where-are-users-2025-05-16/">Reuters ran a story</a> with the headline &#8220;Weeks after Amazon&#8217;s Alexa+ AI launch, a mystery: where are the users?,&#8221; in which it detailed its difficulty locating first-hand accounts of the AI-upgraded assistants&#8217; use online. The Verge asked Amazon about the story, and the company has responded to say that the idea that Alexa Plus isn&#8217;t available is &#8220;simply wrong.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Here&#8217;s the company&#8217;s full &#8212; and rather strongly-worded! &#8212; statement on the matter, provided by Amazon spokesperson Eric Sveum via email to The Verge:</p><blockquote class="duet--article--blockquote ewrhy30 _1xwtict9"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s simply wrong to say that Alexa+ isn&#8217;t available to customers&#8212;that assertion is false. Hundreds of thousands of customers have access to Alexa+ and we&#8217;re constantly inviting more customers that have requested Early Access.</p></blockquote><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Sveum also shared the below screenshot of what the email invite should look like.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Alexa Plus is Amazon&#8217;s generative AI-updated version of Alexa, which it <a href="/news/619755/amazon-alexa-ai-upgrade-artificial-intelligence-smart-assistant">announced in February</a> is free to Amazon Prime subscribers or $19.99 a month otherwise.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">While Reuters doesn&#8217;t say Alexa Plus isn&#8217;t available to customers yet, it does quote an analyst who said, &#8220;There seems to be no one who actually has it.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The outlet also reported that its efforts to find any real-world Alexa Plus users came up empty, writing that it had &#8220;searched dozens of news sites, YouTube, TikTok, X, BlueSky and Meta&#8217;s Instagram and Facebook, as well as Amazon&#8217;s Twitch and reviews of Echo voice-assistant devices on Amazon.com.&#8221; It added that it spoke with two people who&#8217;d posted on Reddit claiming to have used Alexa Plus, but that they &#8220;did not provide Reuters with hard evidence and their identities could not be corroborated.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Still, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/amazon-rolls-out-alexa-to-more-early-access-users-183017242.html?src=rss">Engadget reported today</a> that a wave of emails had gone out on Friday, inviting Amazon Alexa users to try out Alexa Plus. The outlet also reported that an Amazon spokesperson had told it &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of customers have tried the assistant.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Amazon started <a href="/news/639697/amazon-alexa-plus-launch-early-access-missing-features">rolling out its early access program</a> to a few customers at the end of March. At the time, it was missing features like the ability to order takeout from Grubhub using conversational context, or identify family members and remind them about chores. A <a href="/news/639697/amazon-alexa-plus-launch-early-access-missing-features">page on Amazon&#8217;s website</a> notes that some features are still &#8220;coming soon,&#8221; like being able to access Alexa Plus in a web browser or on a Fire TV or Amazon tablet. The company has said it&#8217;s prioritizing those who own certain Echo Show devices above others.</p></div>
