<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft is going to allow Xbox owners to pin apps and games directly to the Home UI. The latest change to homescreen section of the Xbox dashboard will be available to Xbox Insiders this week, alongside options to hide system apps, choose the number of apps and games listed, and modify the size of the tiled UI.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">You&#8217;ll soon be able to pin up to three of your recently played games or apps to the homescreen. &#8220;These pins will stay near the front of the list as you launch other things, giving you quick access to your go-to titles,&#8221; <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/16/xbox-insiders-get-new-ways-to-personalize-home/">explains Eden Marie</a>, principal software engineering lead for Xbox experiences.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you don&#8217;t want to see system apps listed on the homescreen you&#8217;ll be able to disable these to focus solely on games and apps. If you really want to take customization a step further, you&#8217;ll also soon be able to reduce the number of visible tiles in the recently played games and apps list. Microsoft says it&#8217;s &#8220;refining this setting&#8221; and it&#8217;ll be available to Xbox Insiders soon.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft is making these Xbox Home interface changes because fans have requested more customizability. &#8220;We&#8217;ve heard from many of you that Home should feel more like your space,&#8221; says Marie. &#8220;Whether it&#8217;s surfacing your favorite games, hiding what you don&#8217;t use, or simply making Home feel less crowded, this update is a direct response to that feedback.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft previously tested a <a href="/2023/7/26/23808139/microsoft-new-xbox-home-ui-available-now-download">big overhaul of the Xbox Home UI</a> in 2022, before shipping it broadly to Xbox owners in 2023. The software maker made more room for backgrounds, quick access to games, the store, and settings as part of the UI overhaul.</p></div>
