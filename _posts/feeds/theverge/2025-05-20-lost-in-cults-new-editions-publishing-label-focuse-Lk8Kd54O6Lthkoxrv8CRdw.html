<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Editions is the name of a new game publishing label launched by <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/">Lost in Cult</a>, the same company known for making gorgeous books about video games, like <a href="/games/663177/go-deep-down-the-animal-well">Outer Wilds: Design Works.</a> The new label&#8217;s aim is to preserve indie games, including some that haven&#8217;t been released on physical media before, and to celebrate their artistic contributions to the medium by including plenty of extra goodies. Notably, Lost in Cult is working with DoesItPlay? to validate its titles before they&#8217;re released. The group specializes in game preservation, ensuring that games can be run from the physical media they&#8217;re stored on without the need for a download or an internet connection.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The focus on elegantly preserving these titles is similar to what we&#8217;ve seen from Limited Run Games, while Editions&#8217; focus on indie games reminds me of the Criterion Collection&#8217;s approach. Each game included in the Editions lineup will come with a fold-out poster, a sticker, a numbered authenticity card, a 40-page essay and developer interview, and gorgeous cover art, along with the game itself. The first three games to launch under the label include Immortality, The Excavation of Hob&#8217;s Barrow, and Thank Goodness You&#8217;re Here. Editions plans to announce a new game every month, starting in July.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Each of the three games is <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/">available to preorder</a> through the Lost in Cult site starting at &#163;59.99, with the option to choose between Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5 editions when applicable. PS5 owners can opt to buy the entire first run of Editions games at a discounted price, containing Immortality and Thank Goodness You&#8217;re Here, and they&#8217;ll get a third (as of yet, unannounced) Editions title when it launches in July. Lost in Cult is asking for patience with shipments, which may take up to six months. But if they&#8217;re as good as the books, the wait will be worth it.</p></div>
