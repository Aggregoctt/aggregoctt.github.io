<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Apple is getting into Lofi Girl&#8217;s turf. The company has teamed up with Universal Music Group (UMG) to make the Sound Therapy collection of tracks for Apple Music that are &#8220;designed to help listeners attain clearer focus, deeper relaxation, and better sleep,&#8221; <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/universal-music-group-and-apple-music-announce-sound-therapy/">according to a press release</a>. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">There are three categories of Sound Therapy tracks available: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/sound-therapy-focus/pl.6654fe3086ea43498ff05ed652d6367e">Focus</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/sound-therapy-relax/pl.aa243b2eecf54b578949b64bf5923e7c">Relax</a>, and <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/sound-therapy-sleep/pl.44a3d784112843c0b58b0db613eaebf4">Sleep</a>. They feature &#8220;extended, instrumental, and reimagined&#8221; versions of songs from artists like Imagine Dragons, Katy Perry, Kacey Musgraves, and more. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Here&#8217;s how Apple and UMG say the Sound Therapy songs might help you out:</p><blockquote class="duet--article--blockquote ewrhy30 _1xwtict9"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Songs have been enhanced with auditory beats or colored noise to help encourage specific brain responses. Gamma waves and white noise &#8212; a whoosh-like combination of every sound frequency &#8212; may help with focusing; theta waves could aid in relaxation; and delta waves and pink noise &#8212; a deeper, gentler variation akin to rain or wind &#8212; might assist in achieving better sleep. A dreamy version of Katy Perry&#8217;s &#8220;Double Rainbow,&#8221; for example, could help listeners drift off to sleep, while an Imagine Dragons track might help them tackle a to-do list. </p></blockquote><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I&#8217;m a little skeptical about all of that, but that might just be a me thing; I&#8217;m not great at working with music (despite <a href="/22315491/lo-fi-remixes-video-game-music-youtube">how much I like lofi beats</a>) and I can&#8217;t fall asleep to music, either. But if you do like music for working or to help you sleep, these new playlists could be useful.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Apple also has <a href="/2024/12/10/24317828/apple-music-gets-three-new-24-7-radio-stations">a dedicated radio station for chill music</a> and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-18-4-access-hidden-ambient-music-playlists/">Ambient Music tool</a> with playlists for sleep, chill, productivity, and wellbeing.</p></div>
