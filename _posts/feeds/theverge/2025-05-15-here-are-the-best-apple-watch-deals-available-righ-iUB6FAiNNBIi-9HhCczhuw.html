<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In September, Apple launched its latest smartwatch, introducing the <a href="/24246464/apple-watch-series-10-review-smartwatch-wearables">Apple Watch Series 10</a> alongside a <a href="/2024/9/19/24248380/apple-watch-ultra-2-black-smartwatch-wearables">black rendition</a> of the <a href="/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the <a href="/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch">second-gen Apple Watch SE</a>, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before &#8212; and a lot more deals to be had.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, <a href="/2024/9/25/24253366/watch-os-11-apple-watch-smartwatch">watchOS 11</a>, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or 5 behind.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">That being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you&#8217;re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Now, let&#8217;s get to the deals.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals</h2><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ5KQL7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS)</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 329</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 399</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">18 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 329</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">The Apple Watch Series 10 has a larger, wide-angle OLED display with up to 30 percent more screen area.

It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that&#8217;s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">While the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn&#8217;t a vast departure from the prior model, the <a href="/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri">Series 9</a>. That being said, it&#8217;s currently on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ5KQL7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-10-GPS-42mm-Rose-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Light-Blush-Sport-Band-S-M%2F11385157008" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329 ($70 off), which remains its second-best price to date.

It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you&#8217;re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation&#8217;s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration).</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Right now, the best deal on the latest Apple Watch SE can be found at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Starlight-Aluminium-Detection/dp/B0DGJ736JM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-with-Starlight-Sport-Band-S-M%2F11451150677" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS for $189 ($60 off).

It offers the brightest display of any wearable in Apple&#8217;s lineup, along with better battery life and improved performance. It sports Apple&#8217;s last-gen S9 SiP, too, allowing you to take advantage of Apple&#8217;s handy double tap feature.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that&#8217;s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple&#8217;s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it&#8217;s only on sale at Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHZ13GG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">with a Trail Loop</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHRFYMM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">an Ocean Band</a> starting at $729.99 (about $69 off) or with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHNX1SH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">an Alpine Loop</a> starting at $741.89 (about $57 off). You can also pick it up at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsearchpage.jsp%3Fst%3Dapple%2Bwatch%2Bultra%2B2" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-ultra-2-gps-cellular-2024-titanium-case-with-alpine-loop%2F-%2FA-91831052%3Fpreselect%3D91122549%23lnk%3Dsametab" rel="sponsored">Target</a> in various configurations, though only for its full retail price of $799.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">A note on the more premium models</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings &#8212; polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they&#8217;re never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don&#8217;t include them here.</p></div>
