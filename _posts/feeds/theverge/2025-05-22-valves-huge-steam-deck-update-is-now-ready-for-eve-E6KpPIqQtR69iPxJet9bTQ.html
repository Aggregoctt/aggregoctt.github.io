<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Valve has been building up to this for months, first in preview, <a href="/pc-gaming/662705/the-steam-deck-just-got-some-awesome-features-in-beta">then beta</a>, and now finally in a full stable release: a new version of SteamOS that brings brand new features to the Steam Deck and supports third-party handhelds like Lenovo&#8217;s Legion Go and Asus&#8217;s ROG Ally series.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">SteamOS 3.7.8 is the first stable release to add official support for the <a href="/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">Lenovo Legion Go S</a>, and the first to offer an official &#8220;recovery&#8221; image that lets you install SteamOS on other AMD handhelds like the ROG Ally and original Legion Go, <a href="/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">as Valve promised us in January of this year</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Until now, those who wanted to try SteamOS on those Windows handhelds could shoehorn the Steam Deck&#8217;s original recovery image onto their device, or <a href="/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">opt for a similar experience like Bazzite</a>. But now, Valve <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1B71-EDF2-EB6D-2BB3">explicitly provides instructions</a> for getting that image working on a Legion Go or ROG Ally, even as it warns that &#8220;support for all devices that is not officially &#8216;Powered by SteamOS&#8217; is not final.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But even if you don&#8217;t care about rival handhelds, SteamOS 3.7 has a lot of improvements for the Steam Deck. I&#8217;ve been asking Valve to let me use my Bluetooth earbuds&#8217; microphone since launch, and it&#8217;s finally happening in desktop mode (sadly not gaming mode yet) thanks to HFP/HSP profiles. You can turn on your Steam Deck LCD from across the room with a Bluetooth controller, a feature previously exclusive to the OLED model, which comes in handy when you&#8217;re docked to a TV.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Speaking of leaving it docked, you can now set a Battery Charge Limit to 80 percent for longevity&#8217;s sake if your handheld is always plugged in, you can frame-limit variable refresh rate displays, and control the P-state frequency of certain AMD CPUs.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s all underpinned by new versions of Arch Linux, new Mesa graphics drivers, a much newer version of the Plasma desktop mode, and more. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1675200%2Fview%2F820329049655084700" rel="sponsored">Here&#8217;s the full SteamOS 3.7.8 changelog</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">And, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamos%2F" rel="sponsored">an updated SteamOS FAQ</a> seems to suggest that Valve is ready to expand SteamOS beyond Lenovo and the Steam Deck. &#8220;We&#8217;re currently working with select partners on officially licensed Powered by SteamOS devices. Please reach out to us at <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=mailto%3Apoweredbysteamos%40valvesoftware.com">poweredbysteamos@valvesoftware.com</a> for more information about licensing SteamOS for your device,&#8220; one answer reads.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But the industry is still waiting for Valve&#8217;s other shoe(s) to drop. Rumors are still heating up that we&#8217;re close to the launch of Valve&#8217;s wireless VR headset &#8220;Deckard,&#8221; and that it might be pointing the way towards a SteamOS-powered living room console too. Valve has been moving slow and steady, but it seems like <a href="/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">a master plan for Steam Machines could finally be coming into focus</a>.</p></div>
