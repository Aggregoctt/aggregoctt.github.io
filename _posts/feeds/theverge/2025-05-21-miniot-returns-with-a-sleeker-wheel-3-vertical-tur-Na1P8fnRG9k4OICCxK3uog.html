<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The original Wheel vertical turntable was a bust, the Wheel 2 redemption, and now the small mom and pop team at Miniot is back for a victory lap with the <a href="https://miniot.com/products/wheel-3-preorder">Wheel 3</a>. It can play your record collection upright on its stand, laid flat on a table, or hung on a wall. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Inside the handmade Wheel 3 turntable you&#8217;ll find a new optical stylus that the company says &#8220;blows away anything you&#8217;ve heard before!&#8221; It also features a new &#8220;bespoke, high-end&#8221; amplifier and redesigned linear tonearm that moves up-and-down the spinning record instead of side-to-side like the <a href="/2023/3/22/23639244/wheel-upright-record-player-review">Wheel 2 I reviewed back in 2023</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The volume and playback slider is still embedded in the rim at the top near the dimmable display, giving you precise digital control over your analog music.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The new slimmed-down design also looks more cohesive, if colder. It&#8217;s made from two parts: a solid composite on the back married to a polished aluminum unibody front. A Wheel 3 Special Edition will feature a solid wooden back for fans of <a href="/2014/5/8/5621902/miniot-case-ipad-iphone">Miniot&#8217;s organic roots</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <a href="https://miniot.com/products/wheel-3-preorder">Wheel 3 can be preordered</a> now for $3,350 / &#8364;2,900 with deliveries expected in 10 weeks.</p></div>
