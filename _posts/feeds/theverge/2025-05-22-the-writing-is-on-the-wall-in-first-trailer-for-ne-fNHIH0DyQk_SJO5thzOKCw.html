excerpt: It was hard to believe how ill-conceived and poorly managed OceanGate Expeditions&#8217;
  plan to send its people down to the Titanic wreckage was as reports first broke
  of the company&#8217;s Titan submersible suffering a catastrophic implosion. But
  the entire situation and driving force behind it seems so much worse in the new
  trailer for Netflix&#8217;s [&#8230;]

But the entire situation and driving force behind it seems so much worse in the new trailer for Netflix&#8217;s Titan: The OceanGate Disaster documentary.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Produced by Story Syndicate (Britney v Spears) and directed by Mark Monroe (Jim Henson: Idea Man), Titan: The OceanGate Disaster is a both a look back at everything that went wrong with the Titan project and a deep dive into the mind of OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, one of the five people who died when the submersible ultimately imploded at the bottom of the sea. In the doc&#8217;s first trailer, Rush seems to be the only person at OceanGate who refused to see the multitude of ways in which the failed expedition was going to put people&#8217;s lives in danger. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The trailer makes it seem like there was no one at the company who could convince their boss that asking an accountant to pilot an underwater vehicle, or trying to hook a video game controller up to a submersible, were blatant signs of poor judgment. But these are the sorts of perils that come with working for CEOs who simply can&#8217;t fathom that they might be wrong. Following its debut at this year&#8217;s Tribeca Festival on June 6th, Titan: The OceanGate Disaster will make its Netflix debut on June 11th.</p></div>
