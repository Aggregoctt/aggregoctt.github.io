<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Xiaomi has unveiled its first in-house flagship chipset, the Xring O1, and it&#8217;s got enough power to go head-to-head with <a href="/2024/10/21/24273802/qualcomm-8-elite-oryon-cpu-android-smartphone-soc">Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. The company also unveiled a 15S Pro phone and Pad 7 Ultra tablet that the new chip will power, plus a new version of the Watch S4 powered by another Xiaomi chip.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Xring O1 isn&#8217;t Xiaomi&#8217;s first phone chipset, but it&#8217;s the first since 2017&#8217;s midrange Surge S1, and is far more powerful than that. Developed using a second-generation 3nm process, this is a chip intended to rival the 8 Elite, <a href="/2024/10/8/24265408/mediatek-dimensity-9400-agentic-ai-specs-availability">MediaTek&#8217;s Dimensity 9400</a>, and Apple&#8217;s A18 series. On paper, it looks up to the task.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Xiaomi has opted for a 10-core CPU, more than any of the competition. Two Arm Cortex-X925 prime cores are clocked at 3.9GHz, with four more cores at 3.4GHz, two at 1.9GHz, and another two at 1.8GHz. The 16-core Immortalis-G925 is also top-spec, matching the graphics horsepower in MediaTek&#8217;s Dimensity flagship.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Chip architecture has started to vary enough between the major players that clock speeds and core counts aren&#8217;t a great guide to performance. Neither are lab benchmarks, though Xiaomi&#8217;s claimed AnTuTu score of over three million puts this up there with the best, and it&#8217;s bullish about the chip&#8217;s power-efficiency too.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">What this tells us, though, is that Xiaomi is serious about the Xring O1 holding its own as a true flagship: it should be in the same ballpark as Android alternatives from Qualcomm and MediaTek, and far ahead of the most powerful chips from Samsung&#8217;s Exynos team. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">To hammer the point home, Xiaomi is launching the Xring O1 inside the 15S Pro, which is essentially a rerelease of <a href="/2024/10/30/24283735/the-first-snapdragon-8-elite-phone-is-the-xiaomi-15">last year&#8217;s 15 Pro</a>, but with the Snapdragon 8 Elite swapped out for Xiaomi&#8217;s own chip. It also comes in a rather sleek carbon fiber design. It&#8217;s joined by the Pad 7 Ultra, also using the O1, a premium tablet with a 14-inch OLED screen and large 12,000mAh battery, that at 5.1mm is one of the thinnest tablets on the market.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s clear that Xiaomi&#8217;s ambitions go beyond a single chip, and even beyond phones and tablets. To emphasize that, it&#8217;s also launched the Xring T1, a flagship chipset designed for smartwatches. Details are light, but it includes a 4G modem, and Xiaomi has used it to power an eSIM version of the Watch S4.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">All of this sounds like bad news for Qualcomm, which has long counted Xiaomi as a major customer. It&#8217;s often the first to announce a phone running the latest Qualcomm flagship each year, and as the <a href="/2025/1/15/24344208/apple-samsung-xiaomi-2024-smartphone-sales-shipments-idc-canalys-counterpoint">third-biggest smartphone manufacturer in the world</a>, Xiaomi is big business for Qualcomm. It will take some comfort in the fact that just this week the two companies <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2025/05/qualcomm-and-xiaomi-expand-collaboration-with-multi-year-agreeme">signed a multi-year agreement</a> for Xiaomi phones to keep using Qualcomm&#8217;s flagship Snapdragon 8-series chips, but there can&#8217;t be much doubt that Xiaomi&#8217;s long-term plan is to go it alone. After all, if Apple can, why can&#8217;t Xiaomi?</p></div>
