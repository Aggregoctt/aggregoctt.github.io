<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you don&#8217;t have a Nintendo Switch 2 preorder, Best Buy might still be able to help you get a console on launch day. For the retailer&#8217;s midnight openings for the Switch 2 launch, &#8220;most stores will have limited inventory of systems, games, and accessories for in-store purchase,&#8221; <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo%2Fpcmcat1742407305710.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1742407305710" rel="sponsored">according to its website</a>. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Most Best Buy stores across the country will be opening up at 12:01AM ET on June 5th for the launch, per the website. (If you&#8217;re on the West Coast like me, that means your store will open at 9:01PM PT on June 4th.) People who snagged preorders for in-store pickup can also get their consoles when the stores open. As part of the midnight launch, Best Buy also says that customers will &#8220;have the chance to receive a Nintendo collectible.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Online preorders last month <a href="/news/654571/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-issues-problems">were a total mess to start</a>, but many people had success the old-fashioned way: <a href="/games/655949/switch-2-in-person-preorder-gamestop">lining up at GameStop</a>. With Best Buy offering its limited in-store stock, lining up ahead of June 5th might be the way to go if you don&#8217;t have a preorder in and want to play Mario Kart World on day one.</p></div>
