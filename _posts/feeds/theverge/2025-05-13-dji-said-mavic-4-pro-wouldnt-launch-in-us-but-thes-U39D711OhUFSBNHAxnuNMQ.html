excerpt: By the time you read these words, it's quite possible that Adorama will be
  out of stock of the new DJI Mavic 4 Pro. But when I wrote them, the US-based retailer
  was still selling a drone that wasn't supposed to go on sale in the US at all, with
  roughly 70 left in stock. [&#8230;]

DJI did not send the drone to US reviewers, and it wouldn&#8217;t provide US prices when we asked.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But Adorama and B&amp;H, two rival camera stores based in New York City, apparently didn&#8217;t get the message!</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Today, they both listed the drone for $2,699 &#8212; or $3,549 for the Fly More Kit, or $4,649 for the Creator Combo with the fancy new controller with the folding sticks and swiveling 1600-nit screen, or $1,299 for that controller all by its lonesome. B&amp;H even issued a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/13/3080084/0/en/DJI-Mavic-4-Pro-Spins-Up-a-Game-Changing-Drone-with-the-Mavic-4-Pro-Learn-More-Info-at-B-H.html">press release</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">B&amp;H is only offering preorders today; I confirmed with Miguel Perez in the store&#8217;s drone department that &#8220;we don&#8217;t yet have it in stock,&#8221; and he wasn&#8217;t sure when stock might arrive. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little bit of a grey area for logistics between the US and China for aircraft,&#8221; he admits. But he says B&amp;H isn&#8217;t taking anyone&#8217;s money &#8212; &#8220;we don&#8217;t charge until it ships&#8221; &#8212; and that he&#8217;s heard other US retailers like Adorama are selling the drone this very week.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Adorama sales rep Steve Chill confirms that over the phone, and offers to put one on hold for me, because he says they&#8217;re moving fast. &#8220;We had a few hundred in stock, now we&#8217;re down to 70,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They&#8217;ll be gone tomorrow.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Over the phone, he says he has <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fdjimavic4pfm.html" rel="sponsored">the $3,549 Fly More Combo</a> right now if I want, though he&#8217;s out of the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/2nna1c3rrpj6x">$2,699 base model</a>. (At the time I reached out, Adorama&#8217;s website was showing the entry model in stock, shipping next week, though it&#8217;s now just listing a preorder again; however, the new DJI RC Pro 2 controller <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/7xene14peaogu">appears to be in stock too</a>.)</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s not clear what&#8217;s happening. Did DJI ship some to the US early, but not enough for a full launch, perhaps? DJI spokesperson Daisy Kong doesn&#8217;t have an answer for me yet.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you want to try your luck, here are the links:</p><ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1ymtmqpi _11h7yix0 _1xwtict1"><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">DJI Mavic 4 Pro: <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/2nna1c3rrpj6x">Adorama</a>, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1886939-REG%2Fdji_cp_ma_00000849_01_mavic_4_pro_drone.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H</a></span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">DJI Mavic 4 Pro Fly More Combo: <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/2hz73d1thmoqd">Adorama</a>, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1886938-REG%2Fdji_cp_ma_00000848_01_mavic_4_pro_drone.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H</a></span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">DJI Mavic 4 Pro Creator Combo: <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/74lurikpshf8l">Adorama</a>, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1886937-REG%2Fdji_cp_ma_00000847_01_mavic_4_pro_drone.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H</a></span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">DJI RC Pro 2 Controller: <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/7xene14peaogu">Adorama</a>, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1886943-REG%2Fdji_cp_rc_00000046_01_rc_pro_2_remote.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H</a></span></li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Or, you could just call, like me.</p></div>
