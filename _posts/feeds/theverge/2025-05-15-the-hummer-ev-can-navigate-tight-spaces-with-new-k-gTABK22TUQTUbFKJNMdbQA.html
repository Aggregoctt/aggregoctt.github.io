<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">We weren&#8217;t that impressed with the Hummer EV when it first came out &#8212; <a href="/23591501/gmc-hummer-ev-review-photos-specs-price">too big, too expensive, and crazy inefficient</a> &#8212; but we did appreciate the novelty of the <a href="/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range">Crab Walk</a> feature that let the massive truck rotate all four wheels to drive diagonally at low speeds. Our reviewer, Emme Hall, called it &#8220;the weirdest sensation&#8221; and &#8220;a good party trick.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Now, for the updated 2026 model year, the Hummer EV is getting even more crablike. The feature is now called &#8220;King Crab,&#8221; and it allows for even more maneuverability than before. At low speeds, King Crab turns the rear wheels slightly faster than the front wheels, enabling the hulking Hummer to dart in between boulders or through a narrow copse of trees.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">GMC says it will ship the 2026 Hummer, both pickup and SUV, with the new feature. Existing owners will get it through an over-the-air software update later this year. The feature is the result of GMC&#8217;s putting the call out to Hummer EV owners for &#8220;epic&#8221; software update ideas.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The automaker is also releasing a new limited carbon fiber edition of the truck and SUV with improved performance. With a new 24-module battery, the carbon fiber edition will accelerate from 0-60 mph in just 2.8 seconds. (The original model was able to sprint to that speed in three seconds.)</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The 2026 Hummer is now getting bidirectional charging capabilities, meaning it can send power out from its battery to another EV or even a home. And it comes with enhanced Super Cruise, allowing drivers to automatically change lanes when the vehicle&#8217;s built-in map is being used.</p></div>
