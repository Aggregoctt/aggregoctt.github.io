<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Elon Musk&#8217;s X appears to be in the midst of a significant outage. Feeds aren&#8217;t loading, and reports indicate that neither are DMs.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">A quick check of Down Detector shows a spike in reports that appeared to start shortly after 8AM ET and rise sharply. Reports seem to be leveling leveling off. Elsewhere on social media, people have already been complaining about issues with the network for a couple of days, though &#8212; one of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/1ksz1t1/twitterx_down_for_anyone_else/">top posts</a> on the r/Twitter Reddit community is a screenshot of an error message on the X login screen, with many replies saying they&#8217;re unable to log in.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The outage comes after a fire broke out in an Oregon data center owned by X on Thursday morning. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-x-datacenter-fire/">Wired writes</a> that multiple unnamed sources told it that the fire, which forced &#8220;an extended response from emergency crews,&#8221; involved batteries in one of the data center&#8217;s rooms. Following reports of the fire, there were complaints that the site was down, but the outage then was apparently relatively small. It&#8217;s not clear whether today&#8217;s outage is connected.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">X did not immediately respond to The Verge&#8217;s request for comment.</p></div>
