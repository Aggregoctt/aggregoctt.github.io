<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The mysterious device that OpenAI is cooking up with former Apple designer Jony Ive will be pocket-size, contextually aware, screen-free, and isn&#8217;t eyewear. Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed details about the project in an internal staff call <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/what-sam-altman-told-openai-about-the-secret-device-hes-making-with-jony-ive-f1384005?mod=rss_Technology">reviewed by The Wall Street Journal</a>, after announcing the <a href="/news/671838/openai-jony-ive-ai-hardware-apple">$6.5 billion acquisition of Ive&#8217;s AI hardware startup, io</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Altman suggested that the acquisition could increase OpenAI&#8217;s value by $1 trillion, and envisioned a &#8220;family of devices&#8221; being born from the partnership. Information about the first device, which Altman is aiming to release by late 2026, has been kept tightly under wraps since its <a href="/2024/9/21/24250867/jony-ive-confirms-collaboration-openai-hardware">development was confirmed last year</a> over concerns that competitors will set about trying to copy the product before it&#8217;s launched to the public. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Altman dropped some hints during the call that shape our expectations, however, including that it will be unobtrusive, fully aware of a user&#8217;s life and surroundings, and will serve as a &#8220;third core device&#8221; a person would put on a desk after a MacBook Pro and an iPhone. OpenAI is already predicting that the device will be popular, with Altman saying that it will ship &#8220;faster than any company has ever shipped 100 million of something new before.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The leaked call also gave some insight into what <a href="/openai/671927/so-what-are-jony-ive-and-openai-up-to">the device likely won&#8217;t be</a> &#8212; Altman said that it isn&#8217;t a pair of glasses, and that Ive wasn&#8217;t keen to make something you&#8217;d need to wear on the body, having recently <a href="/news/671955/jony-ive-rabbit-r1-humane-ai-pin">slammed the Humane AI Pin</a>. Altman has also <a href="https://www.threads.com/@joannastern/post/CyjR6Epqfts?xmt=AQF0RxaDbIOggAVfe5OPdRkCFtdLlw27-2yJMosEMQIqD5Y">denied rumors that OpenAI is developing a phone</a>. The Journal previously reported that Ive and Altman wanted to <a href="/news/644468/openai-reportedly-considers-an-acquisition-of-jony-ive-and-sam-altmans-hardware-ai-project">wean users away from screens</a>, with Ive saying in a recent interview that his next product is driven by <a href="/news/664131/jony-ive-unintended-consequences-iphone-new-product">owning the &#8220;unintended consequences&#8221;</a> associated with the iPhone.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Altman told OpenAI employees on the call that they have &#8220;the chance to do the biggest thing we&#8217;ve ever done as a company here.&#8221; The Journal reports that Ive referred to the project as &#8220;a new design movement,&#8221; and harkened back to his Apple career that saw him work closely with Steve Jobs before his passing in 2011. Now teamed up with Altman, Ive said, &#8220;the way that we clicked, and the way that we&#8217;ve been able to work together, has been profound for me.&#8221;</p></div>
