<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Following the failure of the <a href="/spacex/625714/spacexs-8th-starship-flight-test-ends-in-another-explosi">8th Starship test flight in early March</a> that ended in <a href="/news/618529/spacex-faa-nasa-starship-super-heavy-booster-explosion-upgrades">another explosion</a>, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has finally cleared SpaceX for a 9th test which could take place <a href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/mission/?missionId=starship-flight-9">as soon as next week</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;The FAA conducted a comprehensive safety review of the SpaceX Starship Flight 8 mishap and determined that the company has satisfactorily addressed the causes of the mishap, and therefore, the Starship vehicle can return to flight,&#8221; the FAA said in a <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/statements/general-statements">statement released yesterday</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Similar to how <a href="/24345430/spacex-starship-rocket-launch-time-watch-live">SpaceX&#8217;s 7th Starship test flight played out</a> in January, Flight 8 saw the ship successfully separate from the Super Heavy booster rocket that returned to the launch site at Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas where it was caught by the launch tower. But at around nine minutes into its flight, Starship began to tumble and eventually exploded before reaching its engine cutoff stage.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Previously failed test flights resulted in Starship debris raining down over Turks and Caicos and parts of the Bahamas. Although SpaceX has said the debris has been limited to pre-planned Debris Response Areas, on multiple occasions the FAA has briefly slowed and diverted flights, and <a href="https://ktla.com/news/nationworld/florida-airports-on-ground-stop-due-to-space-debris-from-starship-launch/">initiated full ground stops at several Florida airports</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">SpaceX plans to reuse a previously launched Super Heavy booster rocket for the first time for Flight 9 &#8211; specifically the rocket from Flight 7. As a result, the FAA is expanding the Aircraft Hazard Area (AHA) as an added safety precaution. For Flight 8, the AHA covered approximately 885 nautical miles. For Flight 9, it&#8217;s nearly twice the size at 1,600 nautical miles and covers parts of Texas and Florida, as well as the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In addition to expanding the hazard area, the FAA is also requiring the Flight 9 launch window &#8220;to be scheduled during non-peak transit periods&#8221; in order to &#8220;minimize disruption to U.S. and international airspace users.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Thursday&#8217;s update follows the FAA&#8217;s decision to issue a launch license earlier this month for SpaceX&#8217;s 9th Starship test flight and modify the license to expand the company&#8217;s annual operations. &#8220;The approval includes final action allowing SpaceX to increase Starship operations from five up to 25 per year at Boca Chica, Texas.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The FAA is still without a leader after Michael Whitaker stepped down as its administrator on January 20th <a href="/news/603113/faa-chief-musk-dc-plane-crash-crisis">following clashes with Elon Musk</a>.</p></div>
