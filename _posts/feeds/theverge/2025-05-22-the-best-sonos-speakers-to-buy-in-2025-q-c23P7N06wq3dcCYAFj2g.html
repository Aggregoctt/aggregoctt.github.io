<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">After the year of self-induced tumult <a href="/2025/1/13/24342282/sonos-app-redesign-controversy-full-story">that Sonos has been through</a>, I can understand why some people are reluctant to spend money on the company&#8217;s products. But interim CEO Tom Conrad has shown that he&#8217;s determined to get back on track and revitalize Sonos as the leading whole-home audio brand. The contentious mobile app is in a much better place today than just a few months ago, though some customers still encounter bugs and the frustration of speakers randomly vanishing from their system. It&#8217;s not all roses, but the situation is moving in the right direction &#8212; and I took Sonos&#8217; decision to <a href="/tech/628297/sonos-pinewood-streaming-box-canceled">cancel its video player</a> as a promising sign of renewed focus. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I&#8217;m not about to sell any of my Sonos gear. For one, the company&#8217;s whole-home platform offers conveniences that competitors don&#8217;t match &#8212; at least not without hassle. Most of the time I&#8217;m streaming from Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music. But if I&#8217;m watching a sports game on my TV, I can pipe the audio from my Sonos soundbar to a speaker in a different room to follow the action. Playing something over Bluetooth? With most of the company&#8217;s recent speakers, it&#8217;s possible to do the same thing and <a href="https://support.sonos.com/en-us/article/share-bluetooth-audio-with-your-sonos-system">spread that music across your entire Sonos system</a>.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Why you should trust my Sonos recommendations</strong></h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1 kuxlcj7">I&#8217;ve covered Sonos extensively for several years at The Verge. This has included reporting on the company&#8217;s latest news, reviewing a lengthy list of Sonos products, and bringing attention to the app fiasco, which eventually led to the ouster of former CEO Patrick Spence. Audio and home theater are two of my primary focus areas in product reviews, so I&#8217;m well-versed when it comes to determining whether a speaker or soundbar is great &#8212; or just another also-ran product.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I wouldn&#8217;t fault anyone for waiting to see where Sonos and its app go from here. But keep in mind that tariffs might eventually lead to price increases for some of these products. Putting the software misstep aside, this company makes some genuinely excellent hardware, so if you don&#8217;t want to risk paying more, now might be the time to buy. And if you&#8217;re wondering which are the true standouts, I&#8217;ve got you covered.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Featured in this article</h2><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd91">What I&#8217;m looking for</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">I put in many hours testing Sonos&#8217; various speakers and soundbars in their intended environments. That means listening to a product like the Move 2 both indoors and outside, having movie marathons to test the capabilities of Sonos soundbars, and spending the bulk of full days gauging the audio performance of speakers like the Five. With devices that are advertised as being water resistant, I&#8217;ll often bring them to lake getaways or use them near the pool to ensure that they can handle splashes and everyday elements.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Sonos has an extensive lineup of speakers spanning various form factors: there are desk speakers, portable Bluetooth speakers, soundbars, subwoofers, and, separate from all that, you have the Ikea Symfonisk products that are designed to blend into your home decor. The best pick will depend on what you need.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Some &#8220;audiophiles&#8221; might turn their nose up at the idea of Sonos hardware being capable of excellent sound. But I think most people will be plenty happy with the audio quality. Even the company&#8217;s smaller products consistently deliver clear, pleasant audio.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Part of what makes the Sonos ecosystem so appealing is everything you can do with it. Want to play your TV&#8217;s audio in other rooms? You can do that. If you&#8217;ve got a Bluetooth-capable record player, the tiny Sonos Roam can play your vinyl and link that audio to the rest of your system. Line-in allows for the same at higher fidelity. Most important of all, the Sonos controller app supports practically every music streaming service on the market today.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Few tech companies continue to provide software updates and new features for their products as long as Sonos. Speakers introduced a decade ago are still compatible with the company&#8217;s latest S2 platform and still receive firmware releases.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best Sonos speaker to start with</h2><p class="_16zyrvq1">8</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 199</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Improved sound (now in stereo)</li><li>Bluetooth and line-in support</li><li>Privacy-conscious microphone controls</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>No more Google Assistant</li><li>Rejiggered controls have a learning curve</li><li>Line-in requires USB-C dongle</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you&#8217;re looking for a decent-sounding, compact speaker to put in the kitchen, office, or really anywhere in your home, the Era 100 is your best option. Sonos improved upon this speaker&#8217;s predecessors, the Play:1 and Sonos One, by upgrading to stereo drivers for richer, wider audio. Bluetooth playback is now supported, along with line-in audio (with <a rel="sponsored" href="https://sonos.sjv.io/c/482924/2804767/32256?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fsonos-line-in-adapter">a separate dongle</a>). And the Era 100 also has reworked physical controls, including a volume bar you can slide your finger across and, finally, dedicated track controls. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The speaker has an elegant design, and you can use hands-free voice controls to summon Amazon Alexa or Sonos Voice Control to skip tracks or switch to a different playlist. Sonos recently <a href="/news/642013/sonos-era-100-ray-price-drop">dropped the Era 100&#8217;s price to $199</a>, which is more than fair for what you&#8217;re getting. I&#8217;d buy now and avoid risking the cost going up again, thanks to tariffs.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best overall Sonos speaker</h2><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087CC4QH4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sonos Five</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 549</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 549</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Powerful audio with impressive stereo separation</li><li>Can crank loud without distorting</li><li>Regular 3.5mm line-in: no adapter required</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>Lacks smart speaker functionality</li><li>Easily collects dust</li><li>You&#8217;ll end up wanting two, which gets very expensive</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Sonos Five isn&#8217;t just Sonos&#8217; best-sounding speaker; it&#8217;s at the top of the pack compared to all competitors. From an audio quality perspective, it beats the HomePod, Echo Studio, Nest Audio, and other mass market speakers &#8212; both those that are smart and not. Can you find better hi-fi bookshelf speakers? Absolutely, but those aren&#8217;t natively tied into music services like Sonos gear is. The Five is a hefty unit and takes up a decent amount of desk space. But once you throw some music on, its powerful stereo output is enough to handle any dinner party or weekend get-together. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">There&#8217;s nothing &#8220;smart&#8221; about the Five. It lacks microphones and voice assistant functionality. But that simplicity is appealing in its own right: you&#8217;re getting a damn good speaker that ties into the Sonos platform. The Five also features a 3.5mm aux input, making it a good turntable companion &#8212; especially if you spring for a stereo pair. </p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best portable Sonos speaker</h2><p class="_16zyrvq1">9</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGGYYK2D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sonos Move 2</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 336</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 449</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">25 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 336</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Improved stereo sound</li><li>Much longer battery life</li><li>Supports line-in playback</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>No more Google Assistant</li><li>Can&#8217;t be used as a speakerphone</li><li>Hefty for a portable speaker</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">When it comes to portable speakers, the Move 2 is in a whole different league than Sonos&#8217; much smaller Roam 2. It&#8217;s bigger and heavier, but a built-in handle makes it easier to lug the Move 2 around your home or out to the backyard. There&#8217;s no comparison between the two when it comes to audio: the Move 2 smokes the far more compact Roam 2. Like the Era 100, it has a stereo driver arrangement, whereas the Roam mixes everything down to mono and sounds more muffled.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Move&#8217;s larger size gives it a clear advantage in terms of bass punch, and aside from playing music wirelessly, you&#8217;ve got the option of plugging in other devices over USB-C for line-in audio. I also continue to appreciate that the battery in the Move 2 is user-replaceable, which can&#8217;t be said of many Bluetooth speakers. You&#8217;ll be able to keep enjoying your investment for long, long into the future. And with a dust / water resistance rating of IP56, it can handle rain and splashes of water without problems; just don&#8217;t drop it into a pool.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I prefer the Move 2 over traditional portable speakers since, at least whenever I&#8217;m home, the Sonos lets me play music over Wi-Fi at a higher fidelity than Bluetooth can offer. Plus, the Move 2 also supports Apple AirPlay and Spotify Connect, so it&#8217;s easy to just skip the Sonos app altogether if you wish.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best Sonos soundbar for home theater enthusiasts</h2><p class="_16zyrvq1">8</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 999</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>More immersive sound than original Arc</li><li>Bass gains are substantial enough to make this a viable standalone option</li><li>Now supports Bluetooth audio</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>Sonos app remains buggy for some</li><li>Play:1 and Play:3 no longer supported as surrounds</li><li>Still no DTS:X</li><li>Full surround setup skyrockets the cost</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Introduced in late 2024, the Arc Ultra improves on the original Arc with significantly more powerful bass response. That&#8217;s largely thanks to the inclusion of Sonos&#8217; new SoundMotion technology, which manages to get a better low-end wallop from a soundbar that&#8217;s not much larger than the model it replaces. This means some buyers can get away with buying the Arc Ultra on its own without adding a subwoofer. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Arc Ultra delivers Dolby Atmos surround sound that&#8217;s more convincing and immersive than any other Sonos soundbar to date, and it&#8217;s up there with the very best you can find from a single-enclosure speaker. Vocal clarity has also improved substantially thanks to better center channel performance. Another upgrade over the first Arc is the addition of Bluetooth audio support.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best Sonos soundbar for smaller rooms</h2><p class="_16zyrvq1">8</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 499</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Wider, more expansive sound</li><li>HDMI eARC brings better performance</li><li>Sleeker design than first Beam</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>No up-facing Atmos speakers</li><li>Doesn&#8217;t have automatic Trueplay</li><li>Same acoustic architecture as prior model</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">There are plenty of scenarios and TV rooms where the Arc Ultra might be too powerful. If you&#8217;re in a smaller space or don&#8217;t need the absolute best surround sound, the Beam (Gen 2) starts to make more sense. It still has Atmos, but the effect is virtualized since the Beam lacks the Arc Ultra&#8217;s upward-firing speakers. Even so, the home theater experience you&#8217;ll get from the Beam will blow away any speakers built into a TV. </p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best Sonos subwoofer for most people</h2><p class="_16zyrvq1">7</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BGJV72YM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sonos Sub Mini</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 425</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 429</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">1 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 425</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Sleek, unique design</li><li>Good bass presence for its size</li><li>Easy setup process</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>Not suitable for large living rooms</li><li>Still not cheap</li><li>Trueplay tuning only works on iOS</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In the same vein, unless you&#8217;re hell bent on rumbling your walls, the $429 Sub Mini subwoofer is more than enough for layering some extra oomph and growl onto Hollywood blockbusters and your favorite TV shows. The $799 Sub 4 is Sonos&#8217; flagship subwoofer, but plenty of people have saved hundreds of dollars by pairing the Sub Mini with any of the company&#8217;s soundbars &#8212; and they&#8217;ve been ecstatic with the results. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As its name suggests, the Sub Mini is more compact than the Sub 4, which makes it easier to find an inconspicuous spot to place it. Even if you&#8217;re the type to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4o13mNmlaA">do a sub crawl</a> and put it somewhere in plain sight, I&#8217;d argue it looks more stylish than the blocky Sub 4. </p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best budget Sonos speaker</h2><p class="_16zyrvq1">7</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 120</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Affordable way into Sonos ecosystem</li><li>Can be mounted as a shelf</li><li>Satisfactory sound for the size</li><li>Good option for Sonos surround sound</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>No built-in mic for voice assistants</li><li>You&#8217;ll want two for the best audio experience</li><li>No 3.5mm aux input</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Sonos and Ikea might be <a href="/news/661491/sonos-ikea-symfonisk-discontinued">ending their partnership</a>, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you should sleep on the existing Symfonisk products before they&#8217;re completely phased out. In particular, the Symfonisk Bookshelf Speaker (Gen 2) is the most affordable gateway into the Sonos ecosystem &#8212; especially if you can catch it at a discount during Ikea&#8217;s routine sales. Sound-wise, it&#8217;s not far off from the old Sonos One / Play:1 and is a very enjoyable speaker. Plus, the low price makes it easier to convince yourself to scoop up two for a stereo pair. These &#8212; or the <a href="/22573890/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-review">Symfonisk Picture Frame Speaker</a> &#8212; make excellent rear surround speakers if you&#8217;re on a budget. </p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The Sonos product worthy of a second chance</h2><p class="_16zyrvq1">7</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYHGTMNH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sonos Ace</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 416</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 449</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">7 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 416</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Stylish design and excellent comfort</li><li>Sound, ANC, and transparency are all good</li><li>TV Audio Swap is convenient, versatile, and suitable for gaming</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>TV Audio Swap handoff can be glitchy</li><li>Headphones can&#8217;t be grouped with Sonos speakers</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Boy oh boy, did Sonos&#8217; wireless headphones come right at the worst possible moment. The company&#8217;s app crisis completely sidelined the Ace headphones. Some customers were also disappointed that the Ace can&#8217;t play music over Wi-Fi or be grouped with the company&#8217;s in-home speakers.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But here&#8217;s the thing: the Ace headphones are still fantastic. They&#8217;re comfortable, have a gorgeous design (with easily swappable ear pads), and sound detailed, powerful, and expressive. They support wired audio over USB-C in addition to Bluetooth. And the TV Audio Swap feature is a useful perk that I still often use late at night when my Arc Ultra would disturb others. You can route any audio that would normally come through the soundbar &#8212; from your TV, gaming console, or streaming device &#8212; through the headphones and listen privately (with spatial audio surround sound).</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">No, the Ace headphones aren&#8217;t what I&#8217;d consider the ideal of a wearable product from Sonos. But they remain a wholly impressive debut that fell victim to the company&#8217;s poor software decisions. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Photography by Chris Welch / The Verge</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Update, May 22nd:</strong> Updated pricing / availability for several products and noted that Sonos will no longer be making new products in collaboration with Ikea.</p></div>
