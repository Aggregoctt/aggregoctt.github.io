<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Sony has announced its latest flagship smartphone, the Xperia 1 VII, and it fits right into the company&#8217;s wheelhouse: a familiar design, tech cobbled together from across Sony&#8217;s other hardware brands, and a price tag that&#8217;ll sting.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Sony&#8217;s last few flagships have been technological powerhouses that eschewed tech industry trends in favor of enthusiast features like expandable storage, headphone jacks, and an emphasis on Sony&#8217;s hardware know-how. In recent years, Sony has leaned on the expertise of its Alpha camera and Bravia TV teams in designing its Xperia handsets, and this time it&#8217;s added the Walkman department into the mix for upgraded audio. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">On the camera side, the big Alpha addition is an <a href="/23660621/sony-alpha-zve1-mirrorless-camera-announcement-specs-price-video-review">AI-based auto-framing mode</a>, which recognizes human subjects and automatically crops videos to keep them centered in the frame (though the max resolution drops to Full HD due to the crop). As for hardware, a new 48-megapixel ultrawide, with a sensor twice as large as before, is the main upgrade on last year&#8217;s phone. The ultrawide was the clear weak link in the <a href="/2024/5/16/24158174/sony-xperia-1-vi-flagship-smartphone-photography-price-availability">1 VI&#8217;s camera setup</a>, so it&#8217;s understandable that the main and variable telephoto lenses are returning unchanged.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As for audio, high-end components from Sony&#8217;s modern line of Walkman audio players have been carried to the phone, right down to using higher quality solder in the headphone jack. AI-based DSEE Ultimate upscaling is supported, along with Hi-Res, LDAC, and Dolby Atmos formats, and the stereo speakers have been given a bass boost.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The big lift from the Bravia display division is smarter adaptive brightness for the 6.5-inch OLED display. The phone has light sensors on both the front and back to more accurately assess surrounding light levels and adjust brightness, color gamut, and color temperature accordingly. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">None of the core specs are otherwise too surprising. It&#8217;s powered by the flagship <a href="/2024/10/21/24273802/qualcomm-8-elite-oryon-cpu-android-smartphone-soc">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage &#8212; expandable by up to another 2TB with microSD. There&#8217;s an IP65 / 68 rating, wireless charging, and a generous 5,000mAh battery. One downside is the commitment to only four years of OS updates and six years of security patches, several years less support than Samsung and Google offer.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The other thing the Xperia 1 VII shares with its predecessor is where it&#8217;s coming out. There&#8217;s no sign of the phone releasing in the US, though it is available to order in the UK and Europe starting today, where it costs &#163;1,399 / &#8364;1,499 (about $1,700).</p></div>
