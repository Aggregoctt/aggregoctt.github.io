<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The US Army is done relying on contractors to repair its equipment. Earlier this month, Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-statement-on-army-right-to-repair-victory">committed to including</a> right-to-repair provisions in all existing and future contracts with manufacturers, a change Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) told The Verge will &#8220;put an end to our dependence on giant defense contractors who charge billions of dollars and take months to repair critical equipment.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">For now, only the Army has committed to securing right-to-repair provisions in contracts. But Warren is pushing for other military branches to adopt the requirement, addressing long-standing repairability problems across the armed forces. She&#8217;s also hopeful that it could have a broader impact across industries and serve as a model for how other companies and organizations can advocate for similar repair-friendly provisions.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">For years, reports have highlighted the US military&#8217;s struggle to fix its own equipment, forcing it to wait on defense contractors to service them &#8212; even when stationed in foreign countries. A 2019 report <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/opinion/military-right-to-repair.html">from The New York Times</a> described how a maintenance Marine in South Korea couldn&#8217;t repair a generator needed for training &#8220;because of the warranty,&#8221; despite having tools to fix them.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The same report said that engines at a US military base in Okinawa, Japan, &#8220;were packed up and shipped back to contractors in the United States for repairs,&#8221; while <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-navy-spent-billions-littoral-combat-ship">ProPublica</a> found that the Navy&#8217;s contract with General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin forced the US military to fly contractors to the ship to make repairs on &#8220;proprietary&#8221; equipment, &#8220;adding millions in travel costs and often delaying missions.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Warren pushed the Army to take a tougher stance on right-to-repair through 2024, <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-leads-charge-to-protect-military-readiness-takes-on-defense-contractors-seeking-to-block-the-militarys-right-to-repair-its-weapons-and-equipment">calling out</a> the &#8220;costly restrictions&#8221; that prevent the military from fixing its own equipment in a letter to the Department of Defense. Warren and Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA) later introduced the Servicemember Right-to-Repair Act, which would require contractors to provide the military with &#8220;fair and reasonable access&#8221; to parts, tools, and information needed to repair equipment. The bill was introduced in December 2024 but has not reached the House floor yet.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The US military is a major force for manufacturers to contend with &#8212; and Warren hopes that adopting repairability rules will have a ripple effect far outside it. &#8220;The Army&#8217;s commitment to right to repair shows other industries that they can do the same,&#8221; Warren says. &#8220;If it can happen here, it can happen in farm equipment, farmers, washing machines, consumer electronics&#8230; and every place else that big manufacturers have tried to take two bites at the apple: the initial price and another bite at the consumer to cover subsequent repairs.&#8221;</p></div>
