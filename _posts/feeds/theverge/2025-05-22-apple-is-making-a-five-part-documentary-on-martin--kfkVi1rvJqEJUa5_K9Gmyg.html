<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">After directing dozens of documentaries over his 60-year career, legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese will now have his own life chronicled for Apple TV Plus. In its announcement, Apple says the <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2025/05/apple-tv-announces-the-five-part-documentary-film-portrait-mr-scorsese/">five-part Mr. Scorsese documentary series</a> will explore how themes like &#8220;the place of good and evil in the fundamental nature of humankind&#8221; have shaped Scorsese&#8217;s filmography as far back as his student work at New York University.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Apple hasn&#8217;t mentioned a release date for the docuseries, which is being directed by Rebecca Miller (She Came to Me, Personal Velocity). Mr. Scorsese will benefit from &#8220;exclusive, unrestricted access to Scorsese&#8217;s private archives,&#8221; according to Apple, alongside extensive interviews with Scorsese himself that dive into how his own life experiences have influenced his work. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The series also includes &#8220;never-before-seen interviews&#8221; with the filmmaker&#8217;s friends, family, and creative collaborators, including Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Robbie Robertson, Steven Spielberg, and Miller&#8217;s husband, Daniel Day-Lewis.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;[Scorsese&#8217;s] work and life are so vast and so compelling that the piece evolved from one to five parts over a five-year period,&#8221; said Miller. &#8220;Crafting this documentary alongside my longtime collaborators has been one of the defining experiences of my life as a filmmaker.&#8221;</p></div>
