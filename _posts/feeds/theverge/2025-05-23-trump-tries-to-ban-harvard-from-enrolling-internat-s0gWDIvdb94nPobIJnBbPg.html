<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration is trying to strip Harvard of its ability to enroll international students &#8212; an effort <a href="https://apnews.com/article/harvard-foreign-students-enrollment-trump-lawsuit-94b65866c563e67a7a7a3c79e90144d6">blocked by a federal judge</a> on Friday, just hours after the university filed a lawsuit claiming Trump was violating its First Amendment rights.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/harvard-international-students-trump-sevis.html"> rescinded Harvard&#8217;s access</a> to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a government database of international students attending universities in the United States. The students&#8217; visas weren&#8217;t canceled, but DHS&#8217;s revocation of Harvard&#8217;s SEVIS certification could, in theory, make nearly 6,800 international students enrolled at Harvard deportable immediately.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,&#8221; DHS secretary Kristi Noem <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/05/22/harvard-university-loses-student-and-exchange-visitor-program-certification-pro">said</a> on Thursday. &#8220;It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments. Harvard had plenty of opportunity to do the right thing. It refused.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">A month earlier, DHS <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/17/us/harvard-letter-signed.html">demanded</a> that Harvard turn over information on its international students, including their &#8220;known illegal activity,&#8221; &#8220;known dangerous or violent activity,&#8221; &#8220;known threats to other students or university personnel,&#8221; and &#8220;known deprivation of rights of other classmates or university personnel.&#8221; The department also requested information on any disciplinary action that had been taken against international students who participated in protests. DHS <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html">threatened to rescind</a> Harvard&#8217;s SEVIS certification if the university didn&#8217;t turn over student records by April 30th.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Since taking office, Trump has used allegations of antisemitism at universities across the country to retaliate against students involved in campus protests against the war on Gaza &#8212; and against the universities themselves, which the administration claims haven&#8217;t done enough to quell antisemitism on their campuses. In addition to <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/18/what-know-about-trumps-funding-threats-colleges">pulling billions of dollars in federal funding</a>, the administration has also had Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest several students over their pro-Palestine activism. Some of these students, like <a href="/policy/628411/mahmoud-khalil-immigration-nationality-act-green-card-state-department">Mahmoud Khalil</a> and <a href="/policy/649427/ice-arrest-mohsen-mahdawi-citizenship-interview-uscis">Mohsen Mahdawi</a>, are green card holders whom ICE has accused of engaging in behavior that is contrary to the US&#8217;s foreign policy interests. Others are international students whose <a href="/policy/634094/trump-dhs-arresting-palestine-student-activists-ice">visas were revoked by the State Department</a>, thus making them deportable.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Instead of targeting individual students at Harvard, the Trump administration is going after the university&#8217;s ability to enroll international students altogether. Unlike Columbia, which <a href="/policy/642060/trump-first-amendment-college-campus-free-speech-columbia-harvard">capitulated to a list of Trump&#8217;s demands</a>, Harvard has <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/04/harvard-wont-comply-with-demands-from-trump-administration/">generally refused to comply</a> with the administration&#8217;s requests that it hand over data on its international students; &#8220;audit&#8221; its academic programs, as well as students&#8217; and faculty&#8217;s political views; and change its governance structure and hiring practices.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Harvard <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/05/Harvard-Visa-Complaint.pdf">sued</a> the administration on Friday. In a complaint filed in Massachusetts federal court, the university&#8217;s lawyers called DHS&#8217;s revocation of its SEVIS certification a &#8220;blatant violation of the First Amendment.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government&#8217;s demands to control Harvard&#8217;s governance, curriculum, and the &#8216;ideology&#8217; of its faculty and students,&#8221; the complaint alleges. &#8220;With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard&#8217;s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Moreover, the suit claims, revoking Harvard&#8217;s SEVIS status puts students in an impossible position. &#8220;Termination of SEVIS records presents student visa holders whose school loses its certification with two bad choices,&#8221; the complaint claims: transferring immediately, or leaving the country.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">A federal judge has <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.285083/gov.uscourts.mad.285083.11.0_5.pdf">temporarily blocked</a> DHS&#8217;s attempt to revoke Harvard&#8217;s SEVIS certification. The university&#8217;s international students are safe &#8212; for now.</p></div>
