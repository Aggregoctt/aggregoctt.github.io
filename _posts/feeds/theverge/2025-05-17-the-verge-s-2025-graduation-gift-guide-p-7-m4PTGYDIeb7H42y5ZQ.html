excerpt: Graduation is one of those unique milestones in life that’s both exciting
  and nerve-wracking. It’s worth celebrating, but it also marks a new chapter that
  can feel overwhelming.&#160;That’s why your grad will surely appreciate a little
  support as they step into the next phase of their life, whether that be college
  or their first job. [&#8230;]

<div><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 300</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">A proper collection deserves a proper showcase, which is where Nanoleaf&#8217;s smart LED cases come in. Each reactive, stackable box can display tunable white lighting and up to 16 million hues, allowing you to bathe your shoes, figurines, and other items in whatever colors you see fit. And because it&#8217;s Nanoleaf, you&#8217;ll even be able to access the same smart features as the company&#8217;s bulbs.</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 35</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">Who needs a Ruggable or a pricey Tibetan rug when you can get one emblazoned with Sora, Sonic, or a dual-wielding Master Chief? RugsRat&#8217;s circular rugs are soft, durable, and pay homage to video game series new and old. That includes classics like Halo 2 and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, as well as newer releases such as Elden Ring and Cyberpunk 2077. Hell, you can even design your own.</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 60</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">Whether they&#8217;re outfitting their dorm room or an apartment, Ikea&#8217;s Sk&#229;dis Pegboard Combination offers grads a sleek, space-saving way to stay organized. The spacious board comes with a set of containers, hooks, clips, and a shelf, all of which are perfect for neatly displaying everything from keys and sticky notes to cables, pens, and other accessories.</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 100</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">Now that the school year is officially over, your giftee likely has a lot more time to binge. For that, we recommend the Google TV Streamer 4K, which boasts onboard Google Assistant, easy-to-use smart home controls, and the best interface of any streaming device available. The set-top box even features a handy button for pinging the remote, giving it an edge over your couch.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ77D5HL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple iPad (11th-gen)</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 299</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 349</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">14 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 299</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">With its spacious 11-inch display, Apple&#8217;s latest iPad makes it easy to dive into studying or unwind with your favorite TV shows. It delivers snappy performance courtesy of Apple&#8217;s A16 chip, letting you off emails, take notes, or binge-watch to your heart&#8217;s content. Plus, it has a solid front-facing camera this time, ensuring you can video call and stay in touch with loved ones back home with ease.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Pill-2024-release-Compatible/dp/B0D4SX9RC6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beats Pill speaker</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 100</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 150</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">33 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 100</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">Portable and powerful, the latest Beats Pill offers good sound and IP67 dust and water resistance, making it ideal for beach days or study sessions. It&#8217;s also packed with features geared toward grads on the go, including a speakerphone for hands-free calls and a USB-C port for charging other devices. It even supports Find My / Find My Device support on both iOS and Android, so they won&#8217;t have to worry about losing it.</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 299</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">If they&#8217;re feeling homesick, the 6-inch Looking Glass Go can bring photos of family and friends to life like no ordinary picture frame can. Just upload an image from any iOS or Android device, and the app will transform it into a high-resolution hologram with the help of AI. You can even share your 3D pictures with loved ones, making it a meaningful way to stay connected from afar.</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 46</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">A personalized hometown puzzle is the kind of gift that hits the sweet spot in terms of nostalgia. The 400-piece jigsaw puzzles encapsulate a 6 x 4-mile coverage area with a given address at the center, and because they&#8217;re based on USGS mapping, each shows roads, waterways, vegetation, transit, and other geographical tidbits your giftee should be all too familiar with.</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 275</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">Whether you intend to use it for work trips or weekend getaways with friends, the Carry-On is a sleek, durable suitcase that makes travel easier. It&#8217;s packed with thoughtful touches &#8212; including a TSA-approved lock, 360-degree wheels, and a separate laundry bag &#8212; and it&#8217;s small enough to fit in most overhead bins yet spacious enough that you should have no trouble stowing everything you need for a three-day jaunt.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charging-Station-Delivery-Accessory/dp/B0CHFFLF5Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anker Charging Station (7-in-1, 100W)</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 40</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 50</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">20 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 40</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">A cluttered desk can make it hard to concentrate, which is why Anker&#8217;s 7-in-1 charging station is a great gift for grads. The 100W hub features a pair of USB-C and USB-A ports on the front and three AC outlets on the back, making it easy to power a 16-inch MacBook Pro, table lamp, phone, and other gadgets while keeping a tidy workspace.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/HOTO-Household-Screwdriver-Essential-Mechanics/dp/B09XHTMRXH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hoto Hand Tool Set</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 50</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 60</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">17 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 50</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">Hoto&#8217;s electric screwdrivers are a mainstay at The Verge, and the company&#8217;s Hand Tool Set is just as eye-catching. All of the included components, from the needlenose pliers and claw hammer to the textured carrying case, showcase a handsome minimalist design that&#8217;s far more attractive than the usual white-label fare. It makes for an attractive starter kit, if nothing else.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014Q1XX9S/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Codenames</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 20</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 20</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">Classic team-based games like Codenames offer a good opportunity to break the ice with new schoolmates, whether you&#8217;re living with them or just linking up on the quad. The collaborative game charges two so-called &#8220;spymasters&#8221; with connecting a series of seemingly unrelated cards via a one-word clue, which their teammates must then uncover before the opposing team. It&#8217;s simple to learn but tough to master.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003KYSLNQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cuisinart PerfecTemp Cordless Electric Kettle</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 100</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 120</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">17 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 100</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">Cuisinart&#8217;s cordless, 1,500W electric kettle lets you dial in the right temperature for whatever you&#8217;re drinking, be it coffee, a nice oolong, or a dorm room staple like instant ramen (no judgment here). The speedy stainless-steel kettle is loaded with six preset temps and an auto-shutoff timer, too, rendering it ideal for busy grads who always have to jet.</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 11</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">The Last Lecture captures the moving wisdom that Randy Pausch, a professor and former computer scientist, shared with his students following his cancer diagnosis cancer in &#8217;06. His inspiring words encourage readers to reflect on what truly matters and the kind of legacy they hope to leave behind, making it a thoughtful guide for any graduate trying to figure out their next steps in life.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DMDJBCDP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anker Laptop Power Bank</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 115</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 135</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">15 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 115</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">The Anker Laptop Power Bank is a lifesaver for anyone who works or studies on the go. With an impressive 25,000mAh capacity and 165W total output, it can quickly charge a beefy MacBook Pro to 50 percent capacity in just 30 minutes. Plus, with three USB-C ports and a USB-A port, you can power multiple devices at once, including phones, tablets, and handheld consoles.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX532LL-A-AirTag/dp/B0CWXNS552/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple AirTag</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 25</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 29</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">14 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 25</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">Whether they&#8217;re planning to take a well-earned vacation or just prone to losing things, an AirTag is a smart, stress-saving gift for any grad. The UWB Bluetooth trackers tap into Apple&#8217;s vast Find My network, letting you keep an eye out and quickly recover lost luggage, keys, passports, and other items using little more than a quick glance at your iPhone.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://store.moma.org/products/pantone-ceramic-bowls-set-of-6" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pantone Ceramic Bowls</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 103</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 129</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">20 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 103</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">Pantone&#8217;s vibrant, color-coded ceramic bowls provide a simple way to brighten up any kitchen cabinet&#8230; or bowl of Cap&#8217;n Crunch. The six sturdy, 5.75-inch bowls are also dishwasher-safe, making them suitable for everything from soup to messy study snacks.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004W5KPSQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kalita Wave 185 Dripper</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 21</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 39</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">46 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 21</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">The Kalita Wave 185 Dripper might be the only thing that gets your college-bound grad through linguistics or ochem. It brews a rich, full cup of pour-over coffee using wave filters and a flat-bottom, three-hold design, which makes it the perfect companion for pulling all-nighters when the nearest cafe is closed.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kobo-Glare-Free-Touchscreen-ComfortLight-Adjustable/dp/B0C15G7J3V/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kobo Elipsa 2E</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 389</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 400</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">3 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 389</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">The Kobo Elipsa 2E isn&#8217;t just an e-reader &#8212; it&#8217;s the ideal study companion for grads heading to college or grad school. Its sizable 10.3-inch screen and included stylus makes annotating a breeze, while its ability to convert handwritten notes into typed text and solve math equations renders it an even more valuable tool for studying.</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 449</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">The Switch 2 could make for a stellar gift for any grad &#8212; that is, if you can manage to preorder one ahead of the console&#8217;s arrival on June 5th. Nintendo&#8217;s latest hybrid console packs a larger 7.9-inch 1080p display, magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and a host of other minor but welcome improvements that build upon what was already a winning formula.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Skullcandy-Bluetooth-Headphones-Cancelling-Microphone/dp/B0DWC512JJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Skullcandy Method 360 ANC</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 100</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 130</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">23 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 100</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">The Skullcandy Method 360 ANC are basically a pair of Bose earbuds in disguise, which isn&#8217;t a bad thing. They offer well-balanced sound, great features, and a comfortable fit that effectively blocks out unwanted noise, much more so than previous Skullcandy offerings. I guess that&#8217;s what you get when you license technology and audio tuning from Bose.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.lodgecastiron.com/products/round-cast-iron-classic-skillet/?variant=51685752242548" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lodge Cast Iron Skillet (12-inch)</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 25</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 30</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">17 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 25</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">Everyone could use a good pan to cook their meals. With a Lodge skillet, your graduate can sear, saut&#233;, bake, broil, braise, and fry all kinds of foods for years to come. Not only does the hardy 12-inch pan offer terrific heat distribution and retention, but it&#8217;s also safe to use in the oven or over an open fire. The included silicone handle is just an added plus that lets you ditch the oven mitts.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://cotopaxi.pxf.io/c/482924/2168919/27792?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cotopaxi.com%2Fproducts%2Fnido-accessory-bag-cada-dia%3Fvariant%3D39472848175165" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cotopaxi Nido Accessory Bag</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 34</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 45</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">24 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 34</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">Cotopaxi&#8217;s Nido Accessory Bag pairs wonderfully with work trips, road trips, and trips to a shared bathroom (hello, dorm life). The durable Dopp kit is great for holding both toiletries and tech accessories thanks to its zippered pocket and a bevy of small storage compartments, all of which let you store your essentials neatly in place.</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 130</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">Circa&#8217;s leather notebook offers a level of customization few journals can match. Given the pages are secured via a series of discs along the spine, your grad can easily add or remove sheets and organize sections in a way that fits their unique lifestyle and needs. That means they can reorient their thoughts for class, their next job interview, and a variety of other situations.</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 6</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">F*cking Planner Stickers can provide any grad who is trying to keep their life together (or at least look like they are) with a much-needed dose of humor. Bold, irreverent, and hilariously honest, they turn even the most mundane adulting tasks &#8212; from scheduling meetings to paying bills &#8212; into something a little less boring and a lot more fun.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R89PJY6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Black &amp; Decker Furbuster</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 93</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 100</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">7 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 93</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">High-end robovacs with auto-empty docks and AI obstacle avoidance are great and all, but sometimes a classic handheld is all you need. Black &amp; Decker&#8217;s rechargeable Furbuster is a great option for picking up fur, dirt, and other debris, especially since it offers a surprising amount of suction and an extra-long crevice tool for hitting those hard-to-reach areas.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/SONGMICS-Function-Adjustable-Breakfast-ULLD01N/dp/B0149SD6T0/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Songmics Bamboo Bed Desk with Tilting Top</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 40</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 50</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">20 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 40</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1 _18t3ez0n">The Songmics Bamboo Bed Desk is great for sick days, late-night study sessions, and a formidable breakfast in bed.
