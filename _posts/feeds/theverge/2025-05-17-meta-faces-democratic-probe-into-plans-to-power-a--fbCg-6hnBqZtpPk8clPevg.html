excerpt: Meta’s building a new AI data center so massive in Louisiana that the local
  utility company has plans to construct three new gas-fired power plants to provide
  it with enough electricity. Now, advocates and lawmakers are pressing Meta for answers
  about how it’ll clean up pollution stemming from the data center’s energy consumption.

Now, advocates and lawmakers are pressing Meta for answers about how it&#8217;ll clean up pollution stemming from the data center&#8217;s energy consumption.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, shot off a <a href="https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/1/4/142ce027-8201-46f9-a6f9-f9c884cf6fd8/5E5D6F4B0DECC12601BCB5617A973CE29AA5483C86C1B818D2DA914294EE6F90.5.14.25-letter-to-meta-re-data-centers.pdf">letter</a> to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday demanding answers about how much energy the data center would use and the greenhouse gas emissions that would be generated. Powering the new data center with gas &#8220;flies in the face of Meta&#8217;s climate commitments,&#8221; the letter says.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Tech companies are rushing to build out data centers to train and run new AI tools, <a href="/2024/1/24/24049047/data-center-ai-crypto-bitcoin-mining-electricity-report-iea">driving up electricity demand</a>. In this case, power utility Entergy wants to meet that demand with new gas infrastructure, raising concerns about the impact Meta&#8217;s data center will have on the environment and local residents.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">&#8220;We urgently need corporate responsibility&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;Meta&#8217;s backslide from its own climate pledges risks triggering broader economic harm at a time when we urgently need corporate responsibility,&#8221; Sen. Whitehouse said in a statement emailed to The Verge.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In 2020, Meta <a href="https://tech.facebook.com/ideas/2020/9/facebooks-path-to-net-zero/">pledged</a> to reach net-zero emissions across its operations, supply chain, and consumer use of its products by the end of the decade. But the company&#8217;s carbon footprint is larger now than it was when it set that goal, according to its latest <a href="https://sustainability.atmeta.com/2024-sustainability-report/">sustainability report</a>, as it <a href="/ai-artificial-intelligence/657645/meta-ai-app-chatgpt-competitor-release-ios-android">doubles down on AI</a>. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The company has tried to <a href="/2024/8/28/24230481/meta-sustainability-report-carbon-footprint-renewable-energy-climate-change">reduce its emissions by matching its electricity use with equal purchases of renewable energy.</a> It&#8217;s a strategy Meta and other big companies often take: pay to support new clean energy projects to try to cancel out the environmental effects of your facilities plugging into a power grid that runs on dirty energy. Environmental advocates are increasingly concerned that this strategy still burdens communities with local pollution, and that the pressure to meet rising electricity demand from AI is boosting fossil fuel use rather than renewable energy. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">We&#8217;re seeing that tussle play out in Richland Parish, Louisiana, where Meta has plans to build its largest data center to date. It&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RichlandParishDataCenter/posts/pfbid02xNEFmJf9bLAi26v6dr3WtW1e7aec8Gn5yow2Zi2sdENXQJXQLbsdMwtLbZ5ZcEETl">spending $10 billion on the project</a>, the company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-selects-northeast-louisiana-as-site-of-10-billion-artificial-intelligence-optimized-data-center-that-will-be-companys-largest-in-the-world-302322851.html">announced</a> in December. Once complete, the campus would span 4 million square feet, about as large as <a href="https://www.ucs.org/about/news/entergy-gas-plant-data-center-proposal-bad-louisianans">70 football fields</a>. But the project is moot unless Meta can ensure there will be enough electricity available for all those servers, a problem it&#8217;s working with Entergy to solve. Entergy <a href="https://www.entergynewsroom.com/news/entergy-louisiana-power-meta-s-data-center-in-richland-parish/">proposed building three entirely new gas plants</a> with a total capacity of 2,260 megawatts to support the data center, but it has to get regulatory approval first.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Some advocates contend that there hasn&#8217;t been enough transparency around Meta&#8217;s data center plans to help the public understand the potential impact on the local power grid. The New Orleans-based Alliance for Affordable Energy and the Union of Concerned Scientists <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2025/03/07/meta-power-plans/">filed</a> a <a href="https://ucs-documents.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/clean-energy/ELL-Data-Center-Case-Joinder-Motion-Final-3-4-25.pdf">motion</a> in March asking the Louisiana Public Service Commission to add Meta as an official party to proceedings over whether to approve construction of the new gas plants. Doing so would compel the company to disclose more information, and the commission is scheduled to consider the motion on Monday. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to wrap your brain around [whether] a facility like this either might be good for your community or bad for your community without understanding the possible impact to your electrical system, your bills, and your water,&#8221; says Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">There are already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/business/energy-environment/data-centers-utilities-electricity-bills.html">forecasts that rapidly growing data center electricity demand could raise electricity bills</a> in the US. Meta said in December that it would contribute $1 million a year to an Entergy <a href="https://www.entergy.com/care/">program</a> that helps older adults and people with disabilities afford their bills. Data centers have also been notorious <a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2023/04/28/ai-programs-consume-large-volumes-scarce-water">water-guzzlers</a>, although Meta says it would invest in projects to restore more water than it would consume.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Sen. Whitehouse&#8217;s letter, meanwhile, asks Meta to answer a list of questions by May 28th. On top of questions about the data center&#8217;s electricity use and greenhouse gas emissions, Whitehouse wants to know what the justification is for building gas-fired power plants rather than renewable energy alternatives. And it presses Meta to explain how the proposal aligns with its 2030 climate goal.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Meta maintains that it&#8217;ll continue matching its electricity use with support for renewable energy, including a commitment to help fund 1,500 megawatts of new solar and battery resources in Louisiana. It also said it would help fund the cost of adding technology to at least one power plant that would capture carbon dioxide emissions. Whitehouse wants to know how much funding it will provide and how much carbon will be captured. Carbon capture tech has been <a href="/2023/3/30/23663202/carbon-capture-electricity-gas-coal-power-plants-climate-change">prohibitively expensive</a> to deploy and costs are often offset by <a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/petra-nova-wa-parish-project">using the captured CO2 to produce more fossil fuels through a process called enhanced oil recovery</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;We received the letter and look forward to providing a response,&#8221; Meta spokesperson Ashley Settle said in an email to The Verge. &#8220;We believe a diverse set of energy solutions are necessary to power our AI ambitions &#8211; and we continue to explore innovative technology solutions.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Entergy didn&#8217;t immediately respond to inquiries from The Verge. It has a <a href="https://www.entergy.com/environment/climate/#:~:text=In%202019%20and%202022%2C%20respectively,energy%2Dgenerating%20capacity%20by%202030.">goal</a> of making sure that 50 percent of its generating capacity is carbon pollution-free by 2030. But the utility said that gas &#8220;is the lowest reasonable cost option available that can support the 24/7 electrical demands of a large data center like Meta,&#8221; in a <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91334846/meta-is-building-a-new-data-center-in-louisiana-and-this-senate-committee-wants-to-know-why-its-being-powered-by-gas-exclusive">statement to Fast Company</a>, which first reported on Whitehouse&#8217;s letter.</p></div>
