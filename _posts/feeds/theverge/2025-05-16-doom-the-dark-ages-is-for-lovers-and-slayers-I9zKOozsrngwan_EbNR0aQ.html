<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you&#8217;ve spent any time on the internet, you may have seen the &#8220;what I expected vs. what I got&#8221; memes. If I could make one for <a href="/2025/1/23/24349379/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-xbox-pc-ps5">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, in my expected column I&#8217;d reference the earlier Doom games &#8212; Eternal and the 2016 soft reboot of the franchise. But for the &#8220;what I got&#8221; column, there&#8217;d be an unexpected mix. Those earlier Doom games would still be there, as in most respects The Dark Ages is very much like its predecessors. But I&#8217;d also throw in Band of Brothers, Pirates of the Caribbean, Pacific Rim, The Necronomicon, and a collection of the best bodice-ripper romance books literature can provide. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">For The Dark Ages, id Software takes the story way back to the early days, to a time before the demons invade Mars and Earth. The Doomguy, known as the Slayer, is a supersoldier enhanced by aliens who have styled themselves as humanity&#8217;s gods. When those gods and their human collaborators are besieged by the legions of Hell, the Slayer gets to doing what he does best: ripping and tearing until it is done.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Slayer has an arsenal of weapons to aid him in his quest. The series&#8217; time-honored favorites, like the super shotgun, make an appearance. But in this old-timey prequel of sorts, the Slayer has all new weapons to get medieval on demon asses. I&#8217;m actually really surprised at how much I enjoyed using every weapon in this game. Typically for games that give you a varied arsenal of guns, only one or two are worth using, as there&#8217;s only so many ways a thing you shoot people with is materially different from another thing you shoot people with. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But each gun in The Dark Ages was designed with a distinct purpose and enough utility to still get the job done outside that purpose. The accelerator breaks energy shields and with upgrades can paralyze enemies. The impaler works as a semiautomatic pistol to mow down swarms of fodder but can also transition into a sniper rifle that shoots bullets the length of railroad spikes. But though I love every gun equally, it&#8217;s the Slayer&#8217;s shield that makes combat so dang entertaining. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Using the Slayer&#8217;s shield is the most fun I&#8217;ve had playing a shooting-focused game because now, instead of shooting bullets, I am the bullet. Using the shield&#8217;s charge ability, I can shoot across the battlefield ramming into enemies and turning them into paste. When that ability&#8217;s on cooldown, I can also use the shield to parry attacks, reflecting them back where they came for massive damage. Parrying&#8217;s useful to break enemy armor and protect yourself and, unlike in <a href="/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, it doesn&#8217;t take an advanced degree in theoretical physics to figure out the timing. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Between the shield, the Slayer&#8217;s melee attack, and all the guns, combat in The Dark Ages feels like entering mini flow states. Every action fits together like a ballet of carnage. Shoot the metal armor to weaken it, throw the shield to destroy it, and then, by the time it&#8217;s returned to my hand, the enemy has unleashed a blast I deflect back to kill it. And because combat is so much more involved than point and shoot, I can bear the fact that there&#8217;s not a lot of enemy variety or unique boss encounters. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Another conflict between the &#8220;what I expected&#8221; and the &#8220;what I got&#8221; columns is how strangely peaceful and Zen-like playing The Dark Ages is. The levels are large, filled with secrets and collectibles that I enjoy searching for. Completing a level 100 percent doesn&#8217;t feel like an exercise in tedium but rather a reward for perseverance and clever puzzle solving, especially for someone like me who is very much not a completionist. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In addition to the ripping and the tearing, there are other special sections of The Dark Ages in which the Slayer pilots either a big-ass Doomecha fighting enemies Rock &#8217;Em Sock &#8217;Em Robots style, or a big-ass dragon with flying sections. These moments were a miss for me. Despite the &#8220;rule of cool&#8221; novelty of the mecha and the dragon, without the variety of the Slayer&#8217;s weapons, combat in these sections is boring as &#8212; forgive me &#8212; hell. All you do in the mecha is walk and punch. All you do with the dragon is fly (poorly) and shoot a cannon (also poorly). They&#8217;re certainly cool to look at in cutscenes, but mechanically, I&#8217;d rather be back on the ground.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But my favorite part of this entire game is the story. I know that&#8217;s not something you&#8217;re supposed to say about Doom. It&#8217;s <strong>Doom</strong>: the story is superfluous to all the demon killing. But thinking about the narrative id laid out, I start giggling and kicking my feet like a blushing schoolgirl, because this Slayer is a lover!</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Just like in the other games, this man cannot be bargained with and he has no moral ambiguity. If you are a demon, you die. If you enable demons, no matter how &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;noble&#8221; your reasoning is, you die. And he is just so stylish at killing things, inflaming my competency kink.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But more than that, despite the fact that in previous games the Slayer doesn&#8217;t speak outside of pained grunts and his face is covered for most of the game, the way this man emotes belies so much depth. There&#8217;s a moment in the middle of one of the dragon sections where, just before he hops back on his loyal steed, he takes a beat to place his hand tenderly on the creature&#8217;s neck. But my favorite Slayer moment comes early in the game. He&#8217;s being held in stasis by his alien masters as they don&#8217;t want to deploy him and thereby draw Hell&#8217;s attention. He&#8217;s forced to watch as his human allies are overrun, and he is so overcome with rage that he&#8217;s able to briefly break the chains that bind him. You could be forgiven for believing the Slayer is driven by the desire to vanquish Hell, but that&#8217;s only partly true. In The Dark Ages, he is just as much a lover as he is a fighter, and the hottest thing a man can do is rip and care. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Dark Ages is so good because it brings out the kid in me. Describing it to other people makes me sound like a child trying to explain something that sounds nothing like what you&#8217;d expect from a Doom game as I ramble off events with no regard for shaping a coherent story. &#8220;And then, a big mancubus appeared, and I parried its blast with my shield and then a bolt of lightning came down from the sky and it killed a bunch of demons. And it was awesome.&#8221;</p></div>
