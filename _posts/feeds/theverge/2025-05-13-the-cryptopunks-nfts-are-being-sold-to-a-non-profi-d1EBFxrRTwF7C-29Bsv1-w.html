<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It would seem that the money-making days for CryptoPunks, one of the oldest and most valuable NFT brands, are well and truly over. After acquiring the non-fungible token collection <a href="/2022/3/11/22973394/bored-ape-yacht-club-cryptopunks-meebits-nft">from Larva Labs in 2022</a>, Bored Ape Yacht Club creator <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250512398123/en/The-Infinite-Node-Foundation-Acquires-CryptoPunks-IP-from-Yuga-Labs">Yuga Labs is now selling CryptoPunks</a> to <a href="https://nodefoundation.com/">Infinite Node Foundation</a> &#8212; a non-profit focused on preserving digital art.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">CryptoPunks, alongside brands like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoKitties, is frequently credited for kicking off the <a href="/23141561/nft-boom-token-mint-artists-collectors-auction">NFT craze in 2021</a>. Several tokens have <a href="/2021/5/11/22430254/cryptopunks-christies-sale-larva-labs">been sold for millions</a>, including one in 2022 that was purchased for more than $23 million worth of Ethereum cryptocurrency, but the <a href="https://cryptopunks.app/cryptopunks/topsales">sales charts have largely stagnated since</a>. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Details for the purchase are slim. CryptoPunks general manager Natalie Stone told The Verge that the terms of the deal won&#8217;t be disclosed, and that the brand will be stewarded by the Node Foundation, with no plans to integrate the CryptoPunks token collection into the <a href="/2022/3/22/22991272/yuga-labs-seed-funding-a16z-bored-ape-yacht-club-bayc-metaverse-other-side">gamified Otherside metaverse</a> that Yuga Labs is developing. &#8220;Yuga is still one of the biggest holders of Punks, and like all other CryptoPunks NFT holders, will retain the right to its CryptoPunks characters under the IP license,&#8221; said Stone.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It was also never clear how much Yuga Labs spent to acquire CryptoPunks in its heyday, but being sold to a non-profit is probably not a good sign for, well, profitability. Now that NFT&#8217;s are a shambling shadow of their former glory, the focus is turning to making CryptoPunks relevant in the mainstream art industry.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;We&#8217;ve worked to elevate and protect their legacy, but we always knew Punks needed a permanent home built for preservation,&#8221; Yuga Labs co-founder Wylie Aronow said in the announcement release. &#8220;Seeing that vision come to life with the Node Foundation feels like a full-circle moment. They are best positioned to protect the Punks legacy.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Node Foundation chair Micky Malka said that &#8220;CryptoPunks sparked a cultural movement,&#8221; and that the non-profit intends to &#8220;future-proof this landmark work&#8221; and make it more accessible for scholars, curators, and collectors to engage with. Node is planning to showcase all 10,000 CryptoPunks tokens at the foundation&#8217;s permanent exhibition space in Palo Alto, and in the &#8220;<a href="https://toledomuseum.org/exhibitions/infinite-images-the-art-of-algorithms">Infinite Images: The Art of Algorithms</a>&#8221; exhibit at the Toledo Museum of Art.</p></div>
