<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s not the next mainline entry in the series, but Atlus did announced a new Persona game today. It&#8217;s called Persona 5: The Phantom X, and it&#8217;s a spinoff that&#8217;s launching on both mobile and PC on June 26th.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As the name implies, The Phantom X is set in the same universe as <a href="/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3">2017&#8217;s Persona 5</a>, and will feature a new main character leading a new band of Phantom Thieves. This story takes place in &#8220;a mysterious Tokyo where desires have been lost.&#8221; The structure of The Phantom X sounds a lot like traditional Persona, as players will experience normal high school life during the day, before heading off to explore dungeons at night. There&#8217;s also turn-based combat and a &#8220;synergy system&#8221; where players can form close ties with NPCs in the game.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">There are also multiplayer elements, including guilds which allow &#8220;players to interact with one another in-game.&#8221; From the sounds of it, The Phantom X is an attempt to blend the single-player RPGs the franchise is known for with live-service mobile games designed to keep players coming back. It&#8217;s hard to say right now how well those two sides will gel together; it&#8217;s also not clear at the moment if the game will be free-to-play. Hopefully it still has curry.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Given it&#8217;s been nearly a decade since Persona 5 launched, Atlus releasing another spinoff will likely be a disappointment to some fans expecting any sign of life from Persona 6 (<a href="/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona">at least Metaphor: ReFantazio turned out well</a>). Then again, The Phantom X at least looks the part, and might be a good way to fill in the time before the next major release.</p></div>
