<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google is taking its virtual try-on feature to a new level. Instead of seeing what a piece of clothing <a href="/2023/6/14/23760504/google-shopping-ai-modeling-virtual-try-on-search-filters">might look like on a wide range of models</a>, it&#8217;s now <a href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/google-shopping-ai-mode-virtual-try-on-update/">testing a feature</a> that lets you upload a photo of yourself to see how it might look on you.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The new feature is rolling out in Search Labs in the US today. Once you opt into the experiment, you can check it out by selecting the &#8220;try it on&#8221; button next to pants, shirts, dresses, and skirts that appear in Google&#8217;s search results. Google will then ask for a full-length photo, which the company will use to generate an image of you wearing the piece of clothing you&#8217;re shopping for. You can save and share the images.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google says the feature uses an AI model that &#8220;understands the human body and nuances of clothing &#8212; like how different materials fold, stretch and drape on different bodies.&#8221; </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google will also soon allow you to shop in AI Mode &#8212; the new, Gemini-powered search <a href="/news/659448/google-ai-mode-search-public-test-us">experience it began rolling out to more users in March</a>. If you tell AI Mode that you&#8217;re looking for a new travel bag, for example, it will automatically show a personalized panel of images and product listings.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">You can narrow the selection by providing more details about your needs, like noting you need a bag for a May trip to Portland, Oregon. Google says AI Mode will conduct multiple searches simultaneously, allowing it to determine what features are suitable for rainy weather and then surface results that meet those needs, such as having waterproof fabric and more pockets.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">There&#8217;s also a new &#8220;agentic&#8221; checkout feature rolling out to Google users in the US in the coming months. Right now, if you tap &#8220;track price&#8221; on a product listing, select a size, color, and the amount you want to spend, Google will automatically notify you when it drops to your preferred price. A new feature lets you confirm your purchase details and then select &#8220;buy for me.&#8221; Google will then check out on the merchant&#8217;s website and &#8220;securely complete the checkout on your behalf&#8221; using Google Pay.</p></div>
