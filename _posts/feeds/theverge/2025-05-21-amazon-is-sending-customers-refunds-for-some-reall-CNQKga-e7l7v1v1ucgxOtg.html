excerpt: Amazon is issuing refunds to customers who’d returned products but never
  received their money back, in some cases from as long ago as 2018.&#160; “Following
  a recent internal review, we identified a very small subset of returns that were
  unresolved because we could not verify that the correct item had been sent back
  to us,” [&#8230;]

<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Amazon is issuing refunds to customers who&#8217;d returned products but never received their money back, in some cases from as long ago as 2018. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;Following a recent internal review, we identified a very small subset of returns that were unresolved because we could not verify that the correct item had been sent back to us,&#8221; Amazon said in emails to customers, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-20/amazon-gives-refunds-apologizes-for-years-old-returns-issues">Bloomberg</a>. &#8220;We could have notified these customers more clearly (and earlier) to better understand the status and help us resolve the return. Given the time elapsed, we&#8217;ve decided to err on the side of customers and just complete refunds for these returns.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Amazon had hinted refunds were coming during its <a href="/news/659868/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-tariffs">most recent earnings call</a> on May 1st. CFO Brian Olsavsky confirmed that the company was reporting a one-time charge of $1.1 billion, partly attributable to &#8220;some historical customer returns,&#8221; along with the costs of stockpiling inventory in preparation for Trump&#8217;s tariffs.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">There have been reports of the belated refunds from Amazon customers on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1kjdutg/comment/mrmy4c4/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://x.com/specialkdelslay/status/1922871021348004043">X</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7330386633764102146/">LinkedIn</a> for over a week, with one poster claiming to have received almost $1,800 this week for a TV returned to the retailer in 2018. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amazon/comments/1kq7v8h/comment/mt46xcx/">Others claim</a> to have received money from Amazon with no explanation why, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amazon/comments/1kq7v8h/comment/mt84so9/">some report</a> receiving refunds for products they never returned in the first place.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The company is currently facing a <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/what-to-know-about-class-action-lawsuit-filed-against-amazon-and-if-you-qualify/3748502/">potential class action lawsuit</a> that alleges it systematically failed to issue refunds to customers, or reversed refunds that had been issued. The suit was filed in 2023, but this April a judge <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/washington/wawdce/2:2023cv01372/325986/112/0.pdf">rejected Amazon&#8217;s move</a> to have it dismissed. It&#8217;s currently awaiting certification, a necessary step before other Amazon customers can join the class action.</p></div>
