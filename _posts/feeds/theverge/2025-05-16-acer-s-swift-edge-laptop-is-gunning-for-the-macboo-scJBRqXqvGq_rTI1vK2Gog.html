<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Acer is announcing a whole slew of new laptops at the Computex 2025 computer show in Taiwan, including the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.acer.com/swift-edge-14-ai-intel" rel="sponsored">Swift Edge 14 AI</a> that weighs half a pound less than the MacBook Air, and the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.acer.com/triton-14-ai" rel="sponsored">Predator Triton 14 AI</a> for a mix of both gaming and content creation. There are over a dozen new models from Acer, many using some of the latest chips from Intel, AMD, and Nvidia, and a couple examples running Qualcomm Snapdragon X and Windows on Arm. There are also some new gaming and creator-focused monitors to go with them all. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The new laptops stretch across the wide Acer range of notebooks, like the Predator and Nitro lines (gaming), the Swifts (general purpose laptops &#8212; not Swifties), and Aspire (the cheapest of the cheap). <a href="/news/663084/lenovo-legion-9i-18-rtx-5090-2d-3d-gaming-laptop-announcement-specs">Like Lenovo</a>, Acer isn&#8217;t announcing US pricing or availability for any of its new products just yet &#8212; that&#8217;s reserved for regions like Europe. Details for the US are expected closer to their eventual release, no doubt thanks to the <a href="/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">ongoing back-and-forth with tariffs</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Swift Edge 14 AI is one of Acer&#8217;s new laptops I find particularly intriguing. It&#8217;s a 14-inch Copilot Plus PC (like all the models Acer brands with &#8220;AI&#8221; in the name) with Intel&#8217;s Lunar Lake chip options, a 2880 x 1800 OLED display, and up to 32GB of RAM / 1TB SSD. It&#8217;s also just 0.37- to 0.65-inches thick (from its thinnest to thickest points), and weighs slightly under 2.2 pounds. For comparison, the <a href="/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review">M4 MacBook Air</a> is 0.44-inches thick from front to back and weighs 2.7 pounds. The Swift Edge is obviously following the Air&#8217;s mold, but Acer manages to fit two Thunderbolt 4 ports, two USB-A ports, a headphone jack, and even an HDMI 2.1 port in such a small and light chassis. It&#8217;s expected to start at &#8364;1,599 (about $1,800) in Europe with availability beginning in June.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">On the gaming side, Acer made a fairly big deal in my briefing call about the upcoming Predator Triton 14 AI. Unlike thicker gaming laptops that are purely gaming-focused, the Triton seems poised to compete with more portable models like the <a href="/2024/1/8/24025592/asus-rog-zephyrus-14-16-strix-scar-laptops-ces-price-specs-impressions">Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</a>. It weighs around 3.5 pounds and measures just 0.68 inches at its thickest point, so it&#8217;s meant to easily go places. It&#8217;s got a 14.5-inch 2880 x 1800 120Hz OLED display that should be fit for both games and content creation, as well as a jumbo-sized haptic trackpad that supports an included stylus. Chip-wise, it&#8217;s got an Intel Arrow Lake Core Ultra 9 288V processor and a GPU up to Nvidia&#8217;s GeForce RTX 5070, with compatibility for Nvidia Studio drivers. But it won&#8217;t come cheap, with a starting price of &#8364;2,999 (about $3,350) when it launches in Europe in July.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Other upcoming laptops from Acer include the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.acer.com/aspire-14-16-ai-intel" rel="sponsored">Aspire 14 AI / 16 AI</a> (each configurable with AMD, Intel, or Qualcomm chips), <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.acer.com/swift-go-14-ai-intel" rel="sponsored">Swift Go 14 AI</a> and <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.acer.com/swift-go-16-ai-intel" rel="sponsored">Swift Go 16 AI</a> (the cheaper entries in the thin-and-light Swift line), and the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.acer.com/helios-neo-14-ai" rel="sponsored">Predator Helios Neo 14</a> (a lower-cost entry in Acer&#8217;s flagship gaming line).</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">For monitors, Acer has a pair of 27-inch QD-OLEDs, with its flagship <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.acer.com/x27-qd-oled" rel="sponsored">Predator X27 X</a> able to hit 240Hz at 4K and the 2560 x 1440 <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.acer.com/x27-qd-oled" rel="sponsored">X27U F5</a> able to hit a very high 500Hz. They&#8217;re expected to run &#8364;1,099 (about $1,230) and &#8364;899 ($1,000), respectively, when they arrive in Q3. There are also lower-cost <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.acer.com/nitro-ga1" rel="sponsored">32-inch</a> and <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.acer.com/nitro-ga1" rel="sponsored">34-inch</a> Nitro monitors, and rounding out the non-gamer offerings are a <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.acer.com/pe0" rel="sponsored">6K ProCreator PE320QXT</a> and a line of <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.acer.com/pd3" rel="sponsored">portable monitors</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Acer is flooding the zone with new laptops, as it often does. We&#8217;ll have to see what US pricing and availability are like as each of them gets closer to release.</p></div>
