<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">A 19-year-old college student will plead guilty to carrying out a massive hack against PowerSchool, a popular student information system used by schools around the country. On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/worcester-college-student-plead-guilty-cyber-extortions">the Department of Justice</a> said Matthew Lane of Massachusetts agreed to plead guilty to four counts, including cyber extortion, unauthorized access to protected computers, and aggravated identity theft.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Though the DOJ doesn&#8217;t identify PowerSchool by name, the details outlined by the DOJ line up with the attack, such as the <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/powerschool-hacker-claims-they-stole-data-of-62-million-students/">hacker&#8217;s threat to leak</a> the names, email addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and medical information of tens of millions of students and teachers if the company didn&#8217;t pay a $2.85 million ransom. A source close to the situation <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/alleged-hacker-largest-breach-us-childrens-data-agrees-plead-guilty-rcna207963">also tells NBC News</a> that the company in question is PowerSchool.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In January, <a href="https://www.powerschool.com/security/sis-incident/notice-of-united-states-data-breach/">PowerSchool said it became aware</a> of a data breach involving the &#8220;unauthorized exfiltration of certain personal information&#8221; from its customer support portal, PowerSource. The <a href="https://www.powerschool.com/security/sis-incident/">company later revealed</a> that it paid the ransom in an attempt to keep the attacker from making its information public.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">However, PowerSchool customers later received additional threats to expose stolen data. &#8220;As is always the case with these situations, there was a risk that the bad actors would not delete the data they stole, despite assurances and evidence that were provided to us,&#8221; PowerSchool said.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The DOJ accuses Lane of breaking into PowerSchool using stolen login credentials and transferring the information of students and teachers to a computer server in Ukraine.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The agency also charged Lane with breaching and extorting another unnamed US-based telecom company.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;As alleged, this defendant stole private information about millions of children and teachers, imposed substantial financial costs on his victims, and instilled fear in parents that their kids&#8217; information had been leaked into the hands of criminals &#8212; all to put a notch in his hacking belt,&#8221; US Attorney Leah Foley said in the press release.</p></div>
