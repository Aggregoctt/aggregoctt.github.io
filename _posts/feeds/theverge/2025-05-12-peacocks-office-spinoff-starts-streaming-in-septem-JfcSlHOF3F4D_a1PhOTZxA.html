<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The Office</em> cinematic universe is <a href="https://x.com/peacock/status/1921962325252157919">expanding this fall</a>. Peacock has given <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152046/peacock-office-spinoff-greg-daniels-michael-koman">the previously announced spinoff of the mockumentary series</a> a streaming date and name, while also revealing a first image. It’s called <em>The Paper</em>, and it will premiere in September. The image, meanwhile, sure looks like an office. Of a newspaper.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The show will feature the same documentary crew as <em>The Office</em>, but this time they’re following the exploits of a small town newspaper. As the official logline explains, “the crew is in search of a new subject when they discover a historic Toledo newspaper, The Truth Teller, and the eager publisher that is trying to revive it.” Greg Daniels, showrunner on <em>The Office</em>, and Michael Koman — best-known as a writer on <em>Nathan for You</em> and <em>Late Night with Conan O’Brien</em> — are serving as writers and executive producers.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Speaking to <em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/peacock-office-follow-up-the-paper-1236213869/">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em>, Daniels said that “the villain here is the internet and the ability to look at everybody’s news for free, and all the ad revenue going to Google.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The Pape</em>r is one of Peacock’s bigger swings as it attempts to carve out its own distinct space in the streaming landscape.
