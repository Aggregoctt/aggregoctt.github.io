<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there&#8217;s something magical about the old-school instant camera. With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren&#8217;t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Yet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That&#8217;s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, and Kodak.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">All of the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a different set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That&#8217;s why we picked <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWNYPCT1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Fujifilm&#8217;s Instax Mini 12</a> as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd91">What I&#8217;m looking for</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Typically, I try to spend at least a couple of weeks &#8212; if not months &#8212; testing each camera to get an idea of what it would be like to actually own one. I&#8217;ll use them to capture photos of loved ones while hanging out, or subjects and scenes I stumble across as I&#8217;m exploring Los Angeles and its many beaches. I shoot indoors and outside, with and without the flash, allowing me to compare how each camera performs in both bright and low-light environments.I also ask friends and family &#8212; both young and old &#8212; for their input on image quality, and I have them take photos with the instant camera to get their thoughts on usability. If the camera comes with extra features, such as filters or support for a companion app, I&#8217;ll make sure to put them to the test in real-life situations. I note how easy it is to pull up and navigate the app, apply the effects, and, of course, how the results look.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Instant cameras aren&#8217;t known for producing high-quality, sharp photos, and most of them struggle with low-light conditions. However, the photos should at least be clear and bright enough that the subject is discernible and the picture looks relatively true to life.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">How easy is it to set the instant camera up and take photos with it? Ease of use is a big part of what makes instant cameras fun and accessible to people of all ages. You shouldn&#8217;t need a professional photography background just to enjoy an instant camera. Instant cameras aren&#8217;t known for producing high-quality, sharp photos, and most of them struggle with low-light conditions. However, the photos should at least be clear and bright enough that the subject is discernible and the picture looks relatively true to life.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Instant cameras come with different features at various price points. Generally, the more feature-rich cameras tend to be pricier, but do the extra capabilities justify the added cost? Some cameras, for example, pair with a companion app or feature a built-in selfie mirror, while others include the ability to print images from your phone. None of these are essential, though the added niceties may be worth it for some people.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Some instant cameras aren&#8217;t as well suited for some situations and / or people as others. For example, there are instant cameras that print old-fashioned Polaroid photos that aren&#8217;t very clear. They frustrate me, but retro lovers might find them charming. Other cameras come with advanced creative modes that let you edit photos and even print smartphone pictures, but a young child might find them hard to use.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Each instant camera requires a different kind of film, which means that the sticker price of the camera isn&#8217;t the true price. This is something you should take into account before making a purchase, as the cost of film can quickly add up. Depending on the brand, you may have to pay anywhere between 50 cents and $2 a shot.It&#8217;s also important to take into account that some film is easier to find. The Instax Mini 12, for example, uses credit card-size Instax Mini film that&#8217;s sold at most major retailers. Other types of film, including the film needed for Kodak&#8217;s Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, are available on Amazon but aren&#8217;t sold by as many retailers.Finally, most instant camera brands sell films of varying quality in a range of styles. Some are decorated with colorful frames and patterns, while others are black and white. They also vary in shape and size, from small rectangular prints you can stick in your wallet to square-shaped ones. You can also buy wider prints, and some brands even sell film with an adhesive backing that allows you to use the resulting images as stickers.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you&#8217;re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Mini-Instant-Camera/dp/B0C6D6GL2Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Instax Mini Evo</a> is our choice, one that boasts great image quality and allows you to choose which photos you&#8217;d like to print. Other instant cameras, like the second-gen <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Polaroid-Generation-Bluetooth-Connected-Controlled/dp/B0BVNJHMVQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Polaroid Now Plus</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Compatible-Bluetooth-Technology-Laminated/dp/B084MKYMXC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Kodak&#8217;s Mini Retro 3</a>, also offer a variety of advanced creative modes for those who desire more.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Take a look at this list of our instant camera recommendations to find the best fit for you.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best instant camera for most people</h2><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 79</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Produces relatively true-to-life photos</li><li>Terrific ease of use</li><li>Very affordable</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>Instax film can get pricey</li><li>Minimal creative control</li><li>Flash can be overpowering</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Film type: </strong>Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / <strong>Film size:</strong> 2 x 3-inches / <strong>Weight: </strong>306 grams / <strong>Charging method: </strong>AA batteries /<strong> Companion app: </strong>None / <strong>Other features:</strong> Built-in selfie mirror, film counter</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If all you&#8217;re looking to do is just click a button and get a decent print for a reasonable price, we recommend Fujifilm&#8217;s Instax Mini 12. It&#8217;s a basic instant camera that&#8217;s similar to our former pick, the Instax Mini 11, but with some minor updates. It still takes less than five minutes to start shooting, but the setup process is easier since all you need to do is twist the lens to either &#8220;on&#8221; or &#8220;off.&#8221; Such ease of use, combined with the camera&#8217;s thinner build, makes it particularly well suited for those new to photography and kids.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">For an instant camera, image quality is also better than most of the other cameras I tested, producing relatively true-to-life photos. Most of the cameras I tested struggled to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash does help. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both dark and bright environments better than its predecessor, but I didn&#8217;t notice much of a difference. The flash &#8212; which you can&#8217;t disable &#8212; is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. If anything, the photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">However, at least the Instax Mini 12 captured my features and skin color more accurately when I used the included selfie feature &#8212; which is really just a small mirror mounted on the front of the camera.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">You can also now zoom in a little easier thanks to a new lens structure, which you can twist to enter the Close-Up Mode in lieu of pressing a button. When in this mode, you can take advantage of the camera&#8217;s new &#8220;Parallax Correction&#8221; feature, which is supposed to result in a more aligned photo. The lens was fun to play with and reminded me of a traditional point-and-shoot, but actually using it to take quality photos takes some time to figure out. As with the Mini 11, it&#8217;s still somewhat tricky to center your subject in the frame using this mode, even with the updated lens. Thankfully, it became easier to properly align photos after a couple of attempts (as well as some composition guidance from the manual).</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the fact that the camera comes with a small counter that displays the remaining number of shots, which is a feature many of the other instant cameras I tested lacked. It&#8217;s easy to lose track of how many photos you&#8217;ve taken, especially when out for drinks or while sightseeing on vacation. Yet given each print costs about $1, it&#8217;s important to be mindful of how many shots you&#8217;ve got left.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">All in all, the Instax Mini 12 is a basic camera that caters to all ages and experience levels and gets the job done &#8212; and done relatively well. It doesn&#8217;t feature Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it also doesn&#8217;t offer advanced features like filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you&#8217;re looking for an instant camera that offers a great traditional analog experience, this is it.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Best premium instant camera</h2><p class="_16zyrvq1">8</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 199</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Great use of dials and buttons</li><li>Lots of printing flexibility</li><li>Good battery life</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>Internal storage is limited</li><li>Micro USB port is annoying</li><li>No viewfinder</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Film type: </strong>Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / <strong>Film size:</strong> 2 x 3-inches / <strong>Weight: </strong>285 grams / <strong>Charging method: </strong>USB-C (on newer models) /<strong> Companion app: </strong>Yes / <strong>Other features:</strong> LCD screen, smartphone printing</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">One of Fujifilm&#8217;s newest instant cameras, the Instax Mini Evo, was a favorite of <a href="/22989946/fujifilm-instax-mini-evo-instant-camera-review-test-photography">my former colleague Becca Farcase</a> &#8212; and it&#8217;s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm&#8217;s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a brown version and <a href="https://instax.com/mini_evo/en/90th_anniversary/">limited edition models in silver and gold</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s easy to balk at its $199 price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That&#8217;s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn&#8217;t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don&#8217;t need to keep buying new batteries.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Unlike Fujifilm&#8217;s Instax Mini 12, the Mini Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can actually turn off the flash on the Mini Evo and use the three-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder. You can also use the menu to adjust how bright you want the film to look when it&#8217;s printed out, which was helpful given neither the Evo nor the Mini 12 are particularly great at capturing dark environments.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Additionally, there are dials you can use to apply various lens options and filters, ranging from retro to monochrome shades, as well as a mirror lens, vignette, soft focus, and more. You can take app-based remote shots, too, which adds an extra element of photographic control that can help you take better selfie shots than the selfie mirror in the front.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Of course, it&#8217;s not a perfect device, and there are some downsides to consider outside the price. For instance, although you can add some filters and make a few edits using Fujifilm&#8217;s companion app, it just isn&#8217;t as feature-rich as some of the apps available for the other digital and hybrid instant cameras I tested. The Evo&#8217;s extensive menu system isn&#8217;t particularly easy to navigate, either, and it took me some time to figure out how to turn the flash on and off. Plus, if you rely on internal storage solely, you can only take 45 images before the device is full. Still, all of these are minor issues, and I was very happy overall with how portable the stylish camera is, as well as how easy it is to take good photos quickly.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best instant camera for social occasions</h2><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Compatible-Bluetooth-Technology-Laminated/dp/B084MKYMXC/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 98</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 170</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">42 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 98</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Lets you print photos from your phone</li><li>Entertaining companion app</li><li>Comes with film</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>So-so image quality </li><li>Unable to store images</li><li>Not as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Film type: </strong>Kodak Instant Print 3 x 3-inch cartridge (included) / <strong>Film size: </strong>3 x 3-inch square prints / <strong>Weight: </strong>467 grams / <strong>Charging method: </strong>Micro USB /<strong> Companion app: </strong>Yes /<strong> Other features:</strong> LCD screen, smartphone printing</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Whereas the Instax Mini Evo&#8217;s companion app is more functional, Kodak&#8217;s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera&#8217;s accompanying mobile app allows you to apply frames, stickers, filters, and a plethora of customization options to photos, making the camera great for scrapbooking. There&#8217;s even a beauty feature within the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making this a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Like the Instax Mini Evo, Kodak&#8217;s Mini Shot 3 Retro comes with an LCD screen (albeit a much smaller one) you can use to decide whether or not you want to print a shot. It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp photos from your smartphone. Unlike the Mini Evo, however, Kodak&#8217;s Mini Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of a film (it&#8217;s also often on sale for a lot less). It also uses cheaper film; <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.kodakphotoprinter.com%2Fproducts%2Fkodak-photo-printer-mini-3-retro-film-cartridge-refill-pack" rel="sponsored">you can currently pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for about $17.99</a>, which equates to roughly $0.33 a shot. The fact that the film is cheaper arguably encourages play and creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than both Fujifilm&#8217;s and Polaroid&#8217;s.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">However, there are notable drawbacks to the Kodak Mini Shot 3. My biggest issue is that the resulting prints of photos taken with the camera aren&#8217;t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone. Photo quality wasn&#8217;t consistently as good as the Mini Evo&#8217;s or Mini 12&#8217;s nor, for the most part, as clear and sharp. The photos also sometimes had an excessive pink tint that can interfere with quality. It doesn&#8217;t store images the way the Mini Evo does, either, which means you can&#8217;t decide whether you&#8217;d like to print them later. It&#8217;s also noticeably heavier than the Mini Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Nonetheless, if you don&#8217;t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro is a good choice.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best instant camera for retro fans</h2><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Polaroid-Generation-Bluetooth-Connected-Controlled/dp/B0BVNPW1PX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Polaroid Now Plus (second-gen)</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 119</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 150</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">21 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 119</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Handsome, retro design</li><li>Prints dreamy, vintage-style photos </li><li>Several creative modes</li><li>USB-C</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>Struggles in low light</li><li>Film takes up to 15 minutes to develop</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Film type:</strong> Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / <strong>Film size:</strong> 4.2 x 3.5-inch prints / <strong>Weight:</strong> 451.5 grams / <strong>Charging method:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Companion app:</strong> Yes / <strong>Other features: </strong>Lens filter kit, film counter</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you&#8217;re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus is the camera for you. Compared to the other instant cameras on this list, it most closely resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 with its classic, retro-inspired design. Meanwhile, its square I-Type film prints and iconic Polaroid-style frame give photos a more authentically vintage look. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">At the same time, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus comes with a suite of modern features, including support for USB-C charging. It also offers Bluetooth and a companion app that boasts several creative modes, allowing greater photographic control. These include a remote shutter, a self-timer, and the &#8220;Polaroid Lab,&#8221; which lets you adjust the exposure and various color settings. The app also features a handful of shooting modes &#8212; including a manual option &#8212; and the camera comes with a set of five colored lenses you can snap onto the front. These were enjoyable to play with and allowed for more artistic expression.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If there&#8217;s one thing the Polaroid Now Plus isn&#8217;t known for, it&#8217;s portability. Given how heavy, large, and awkwardly sized it is, it&#8217;s not the kind of instant camera you can easily slip into your purse or carry around. Plus, it takes up to 15 minutes for prints to develop, and you have to ensure it&#8217;s not exposed to light while developing. That&#8217;s quite an inconvenience if you&#8217;re out with friends, say, at the beach on a sunny day.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you&#8217;re looking for an instant camera that can easily print a good, clear photo without much effort on your part, this is not the camera for you. Of all the cameras on this list, the latest Polaroid Now Plus struggles with low-light environments the most. I could barely see images I took indoors, and I could only get the clearest shots when the light was directly behind me during the day &#8212; specifically, in the morning. Even these images weren&#8217;t as clear in comparison to Instax film, and both contrast and color saturation levels tend to be quite low.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Admittedly, this gave my pictures more of a dreamy vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust saturation and exposure settings. However, doing so is time-consuming. Given all these issues, I found it was easy to waste film, which proved expensive. After all, you only get eight I-Type sheets <a href="https://howl.me/ckOmBppUA3u?u1=verge" rel="sponsored">for $16.99</a>, and that&#8217;s in addition to forking out $149.99 for the camera.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Truth be told, however, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for, and you don&#8217;t mind the price, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus is the perfect camera for you.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">All that being said, it&#8217;s worth pointing out that Polaroid recently launched the <a href="https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/now-plus-polaroid-camera">$139.99 Now Plus Generation 3</a>. The instant camera costs $10 less than its predecessor&#8217;s MSRP, though, at the moment, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Polaroid-Generation-Bluetooth-Connected-Controlled/dp/B0BVNPW1PX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">the second-gen model is on sale starting at $119.26</a>.The new camera seems like it&#8217;s largely an iterative update, with a built-in tripod and four new colors to choose from instead of just three. It should also offer brighter, more accurate lighting in high-contrast scenes and improved depth perception, courtesy of upgrades to the ranging sensor, light meter position, and autofocus.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best instant camera for portability</h2><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Polaroid-Go-Generation-Instant-Included/dp/B0CG7P9KTH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Polaroid Go (second-gen)</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 69</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 100</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">31 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 69</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Tiny and lightweight</li><li>Prints vintage-like photos just like the Polaroid Now Plus</li><li>USB-C</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>Struggles in low light</li><li>Film takes up to 15 minutes to develop</li><li>No Bluetooth support or companion app</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Film type:</strong> Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) /<strong> Film size: </strong>2.6 x 2.1-inch prints / <strong>Weight:</strong> 239 grams / <strong>Charging method:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Companion app:</strong> No / <strong>Other features: </strong>Self-timer, selfie mirror, film counter</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Whereas the Polaroid Now Plus is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It easily fits into the palm of my hand &#8212; which is saying a lot, given I&#8217;m petite and a little over five feet tall &#8212; making it easily the most portable instant camera on our list. It also produces the smallest prints of all the instant cameras I tested, which could be nice if you&#8217;re trying to save some space and want something more compact than Instax Mini prints.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Weighing just over a pound, the latest Polaroid Go is also the lightest instant camera I&#8217;ve ever held, and you can easily use it with one hand. That&#8217;s actually pretty convenient, given I sometimes struggled to take pictures with the heavier Polaroid Now Plus and, to a lesser extent, some of the other instant cameras I tested. In fact, if the images produced looked more true-to-life and didn&#8217;t require you to hide them from light for about 15 minutes while developing, I&#8217;d be tempted to call this the best instant camera for travel or small children.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">At $79.99, the latest Polaroid Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera on the market, with film that costs just a little more than Fujifilm&#8217;s Instax Mini shots (or about<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.polaroid.com%2Fproducts%2Fcolor-go-instant-film" rel="sponsored"> $19.99 for a 16-sheet pack</a>). It also sports a small number of upgrades over the last-gen model despite retailing for $20 less. The most significant is USB-C support, which allows for faster charging and prevents you from having to spend money on AA batteries.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Polaroid also claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor, but truthfully, I didn&#8217;t see a significant difference from one generation to the next. The photos are a little brighter, but if anything, the original Polaroid Go &#8212; like the Now Plus &#8212; produced warmer pictures that I thought were truer to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Now Plus.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Unlike the Now Plus, however, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features, although it does offer a helpful self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. There&#8217;s also no Bluetooth support and, thus, no fancy app that will allow you to add extra effects. Instead, it&#8217;s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Instax Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. In addition, as mentioned, the prints are smaller than those of the Instax Mini, which could be a drawback for those who prefer larger, more traditional Polaroid photos. While it produces similar vintage-style shots, design-wise, it doesn&#8217;t look anything like old-school Polaroid cameras, which could also take away from the retro experience some desire.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">That said, none of the older Polaroid cameras came with an app, either. All in all, the Go&#8217;s simplicity makes it a suitable candidate for those seeking an easy-to-use camera that provides a more traditional instant film experience &#8212; one they can take advantage of just about anywhere for half the price of the Polaroid Now Plus.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Other instant cameras to consider</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KODAK-Effect-Changing-Sticky-Backed-Technology-Compatible/dp/B0CQMLV5S6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Kodak Smile Plus</a> is another hybrid instant camera you can use to print smartphone photos. It&#8217;s smaller and less expensive than Kodak&#8217;s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $99.99, and it&#8217;s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">However, it lacks a built-in display, so you can&#8217;t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12&#8217;s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">That being said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app that&#8217;s similar to the Retro 3&#8217;s as well, and although the software is not as snappy or feature-rich, it still allows you to add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I&#8217;d recommend the Retro 3 since it can often be found for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">From photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos, <a href="/2023/10/5/23902287/leica-sofort-2-instant-film-camera">Leica&#8217;s Sofort 2</a> is a terrific camera that&#8217;s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2&#8217;s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it&#8217;s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it&#8217;s twice the price of the Evo. It&#8217;s hard to recommend at $389 since most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The user interface is easier to navigate on the Leica, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also like that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app &#8212; a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don&#8217;t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you&#8217;re looking for an analog instant camera that&#8217;s more advanced, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Mini-Instant-Camera/dp/B0CXZQGL2D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Fujifilm&#8217;s Instax Mini 99</a> is one to consider. At around $200, Fujifilm&#8217;s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12, but it&#8217;s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click camera given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket and an aluminum extension column, as well as a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur while capturing fast-moving subjects.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Thanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12 and Mini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera and not a hybrid like the $199.99 Mini Evo, meaning you shouldn&#8217;t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The new model also isn&#8217;t as simple to use as the Mini 12, so I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it&#8217;s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">While it didn&#8217;t make the cut, the <a href="/21431103/fujifilm-instax-square-sq1-instant-camera-review-price-specs-features">Instax Square SQ1</a> is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Instax Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and comes with a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn&#8217;t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at $119.95, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">That said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Now Plus and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Fujifilm also sells the newer <a href="/2023/6/14/23759847/fujifilms-instax-square-lineup-just-got-a-lot-more-retro">Instax Square SQ40</a>. It&#8217;s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that&#8217;s more visually striking, yet it&#8217;s also more expensive at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1775648-REG%2Ffujifilm_16802814_instax_square_sq40.html" rel="sponsored">$149</a>. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos and rarely goes on sale, I&#8217;d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Fujifilm&#8217;s forthcoming <a href="/2025/1/21/24348502/fujifilm-instax-wide-evo-hybrid-instant-camera-photography-printer">Instax Wide Evo Hybrid</a> is nearly identical to the <a href="/2021/11/17/22786676/fujifilm-instax-mini-evo-announced-price-release-date">Instax Mini Evo</a> You can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $349 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens &#8212; the widest used on any Instax camera &#8212; for taking wide-format pictures. While it&#8217;s currently available in Japan and Australia, Fujifilm hasn&#8217;t specified a US launch date, other than &#8220;soon.&#8221; </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Ultimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Instax Mini Evo, but if you&#8217;re into wide prints (and don&#8217;t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo&#8217;s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lens and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Plus, unlike the Wide 400 (which I&#8217;m still testing), it&#8217;s a hybrid camera with an LCD screen &#8212; a helpful perk that can cut down on wasted shots. However, at $349, it&#8217;s a whopping $150 more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there&#8217;s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken &#8212; something I didn&#8217;t notice with the Mini Evo. It&#8217;s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects like a dog or a hyper toddler.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">What&#8217;s coming next</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <a href="/news/648398/polaroid-flip-instant-camera-sonar-auto-focus-multi-lens">Polaroid Flip</a> is a new, $199.99 instant camera that introduces scene analysis, which helps prevent exposure and focus issues by flashing a red LED warning light through the viewfinder. That&#8217;s a handy addition, as Polaroid says the Flip has the most powerful flash of any of its instant cameras (though its intensity can be adjusted to prevent overexposing close-ups). In addition, the Flip features new autofocus capabilities powered by a sonar sensor that automatically selects from one of four lenses.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Fujifilm recently announced the $129.95 <a href="/tech/644752/fujifilm-instax-mini-41#comments">Instax Mini 41</a>, which is the follow-up to the $99 <a href="/22367999/fujifilm-instax-mini-40-review-price">Instax Mini 40</a>. The updated model retains its retro design but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Polaroid recently launched the <a href="https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/now-plus-polaroid-camera">Now Plus Generation 3</a>, a sequel to our current pick for the best retro-inspired camera. The new model is nearly identical to the second-gen Now Plus, only it&#8217;s available in six colors and features a built-in tripod. It also benefits from autofocus improvements and a better light meter position, which, according to Polaroid, should result in better photos. We&#8217;ll be testing it soon, so stay tuned.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Fujifilm&#8217;s $149.95 <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Ffujifilm-instax-wide-400-green-instant-camera%2F-%2FA-91347440" rel="sponsored">Instax Wide 400</a> is an upgraded version of its Wide 300.
