A $7 discount may not seem like much to write home about, but it&#8217;s notable given that Nintendo games rarely go on sale, and any discount in this economy is a win.

Specifically, Bose&#8217;s eBay outlet is selling <strong><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F165926035635" rel="sponsored">refurbished SoundLink Flex SE speakers</a></strong> in black for $69 (originally $129). The SoundLink Flex was crowned the best Bluetooth speaker under $200 in our <a href="/23022617/best-bluetooth-speakers">buying guide</a>. This discounted version differs only in that it lacks a microphone, which could be used for speakerphone functionality. Not a terrible feature to lose if it means saving around $80 off the cost of buying new.</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The <a href="/samsung/664844/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-thin-phone-price-release-date-impressions"><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</strong></a> is now available to preorder at Samsung ahead of its May 30th release date.
