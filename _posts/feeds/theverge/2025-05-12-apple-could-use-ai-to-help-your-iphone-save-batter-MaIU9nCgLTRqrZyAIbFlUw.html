<p class="has-text-align-none">Apple’s iOS 19 update could include an AI-powered feature designed to conserve battery, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-12/apple-plans-ai-powered-battery-management-mode-for-devices-in-ios-19">a report from <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The battery management tool will reportedly optimize your iPhone’s power consumption based on how you use your device.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The new feature will use “battery data it has collected from users’ devices to understand trends and make predictions for when it should lower the power draw of certain applications or features,” <em>Bloomberg</em> reports.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Google launched its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17327104/android-battery-management-ai-artificial-intelligence-google-io-2018">machine learning-powered Adaptive Battery on Android in 2018</a>, and says it analyzes your phone usage patterns to determine which apps it should restrict from operating in the background, and which ones it should prioritize. The Android settings can control how apps are allowed to operate in the background, in order to check for updated data and notifications.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"> iOS 19 will also reportedly include an indicator on the lock screen that shows how long it will take to fully charge your phone.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As reported by <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple is mainly launching AI battery management for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626597/apple-iphone-17-air-design-thickness-thin-rumors-renders-leaks">the upcoming iPhone 17</a>, which is rumored to be the company’s slimmest phone yet. Its thin design means it will have a smaller battery, making battery conservation more important. The AI battery tool will be available to all iPhones with iOS 19 – not just the iPhone 17, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">iOS 19 is also rumored to come <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/627149/apple-ios-ipados-macos-design-overhaul">with a broader redesign</a>. Apple will likely roll out the update to developers during its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626680/apple-wwdc-2025-event-date-siri-ios-19">Worldwide Developers Conference in June</a> before releasing it to the public in September.</p>
