<p class="has-text-align-none">Apple has released iOS 18.5, and one of the most notable features is that it allows the iPhone 13 lineup to access satellite messaging features provided by carriers. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">With the change, T-Mobile users who have an iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro, or iPhone 13 Pro Max will be able to use its Starlink-powered satellite messaging service. That service is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609208/t-mobile-starlink-satellite-free-beta-price-launch">currently free to try in the US</a> ahead of the trial period ending in July.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Apple notes that the update only allows iPhone 13 phones to access “carrier-provided” satellite features, meaning you won’t be able to use <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105097">Apple’s own satellite features</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/15/23457970/iphone-14-emergency-sos-satellite-ios-16">like Emergency SOS</a>, which are available on iPhone 14 models and newer.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">iOS 18.5 also adds a new Pride-themed wallpaper and a new feature for Screen Time that shows parents a notification when their child uses the Screen Time on their device. There are also changes to the Mail app, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/12/ios-18-5-now-available-with-new-wallpaper-mail-app-tweaks-more/">according to <em>9to5Mac</em></a>.</p>
