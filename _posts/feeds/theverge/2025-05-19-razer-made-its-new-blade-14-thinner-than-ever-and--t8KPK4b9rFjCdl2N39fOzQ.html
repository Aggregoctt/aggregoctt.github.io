<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Razer is making its Blade 14 thinner and more powerful, just like it did recently with its <a href="/reviews/649577/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-review">16-inch counterpart</a>. In addition to giving it an RTX 5060 GPU with a <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2Frazer-blade-14" rel="sponsored">starting price of $2,299.99</a>, the Blade 14 can be specced out with the RTX 5070 for $2,699.99. Razer says it isn&#8217;t limiting that 5070 in this thin chassis, as it can deliver its maximum TGP of 115W.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Both the 5060 and 5070 versions of the Blade 14 are expected to launch in May, and Razer is also introducing a lower-cost Blade 16 with the RTX 5060 for $2,399.99 &#8212; due out this month as well.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Blade 14 will have an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 CPU and a 14-inch 3K 120Hz OLED display in all configurations, as well as per-key RGB lighting with customizable Razer Chroma compatibility. It can be configured with up to 64GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. Sadly, the RAM is soldered in, but the single NVMe SSD slot is user-accessible if you want to put in a larger drive. The ports are mostly the same as last gen, with two USB4, two USB 3.2 Type-A, HDMI 2.1, reversible proprietary power plug, and 3.5mm combo audio jack, but it adds a UHS-II microSD slot.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">What&#8217;s also changed for the 2025 Blade 14 is that it&#8217;s 11 percent thinner and 11 percent lighter than its predecessor. That translates to a laptop that&#8217;s 0.62 to 0.64 inches (15.7 mm to around 16.2 mm) thick from its thinnest to thickest points, and it weighs 3.59 pounds / 1.63 kg. Razer says it was able to make the Blade 14 thinner without sacrificing power or battery life (it&#8217;s still got a 72Whr cell) by redesigning its thermal shelf and cooling design &#8212; just like it did the Blade 16.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Blade 14 looks a lot like a slightly shrunken-down Blade 16, following its bigger sibling&#8217;s redesign to a T. Well, mostly, as its microSD slot feels like a slight downgrade compared to the 16&#8217;s full-size SD. But even microSD is better than no slot at all. One differentiator of the Blade 14 is that it will be available in white as well as Razer&#8217;s typical matte black.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I thoroughly enjoyed <a href="/reviews/649577/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-review">my recent time testing the Blade 16</a>. It&#8217;s unsurprising that the Blade 14 is copy-pasting many of the same changes to be an even more portable hybrid gaming / content-creation machine, and remaining a <a href="/24155889/razer-blade-14-2024-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-comparison">noteworthy competitor to Asus&#8217; ROG Zephyrus G14</a>.</p></div>
