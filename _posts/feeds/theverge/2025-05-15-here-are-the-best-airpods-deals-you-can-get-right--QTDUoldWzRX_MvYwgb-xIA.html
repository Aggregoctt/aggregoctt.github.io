<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you know where to look, you can often score discounts on Apple&#8217;s ever-expanding AirPods lineup. Both the new <a href="/2024/9/9/24236804/airpods-max-second-gen-price-specs-features-release-date">AirPods Max</a> and <a href="/2024/9/9/23313529/apple-airpods-4-noise-cancellation-price-features">AirPods 4</a> (with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do the <a href="/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review">latest AirPods Pro with USB-C</a>. The same goes for the original AirPods Max, which are nearly indistinguishable from the last-gen model aside from the switch to a USB-C connector and a few new color options.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Below, we&#8217;ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each model, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the latest AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best AirPods 4 deals</h2><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple AirPods 4</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 119</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 129</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">8 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 119</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">Apple&#8217;s AirPods 4 improve on previous models with better sound, clearer voice calls, and an even more comfortable design. For $50 extra, you can purchase a model with active noise cancellation and wireless charging.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fapple-airpods-3rd-gen-bluetooth-earbuds-with-lightning-charging-case-white-mpny3am-a%2Fproduct_24543634%3Fcid%3Dps%3Ags%3Adot%3Anb%3Apla%3Atranstech%26gad_source%3D1%26gad_campaignid%3D13825050145%26gbraid%3D0AAAAACN4I7x1LUxwfpk3u3FCgNwSMELIW%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwoZbBBhDCARIsAOqMEZXdXyVoFeamDaQVikll_DmAoEIitPmYbdskIUc6NpNpUz8CHidrc8saAjgIEALw_wcB" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 149</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 179</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">17 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 149</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">The fancier version of the new AirPods 4 offer support for active noise cancellation, a wireless charging case that can use either Qi or Apple Watch pads, and a speaker in the case that chirps to help you find it.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">At its <a href="/24239739/apple-iphone-16-event-announcements-watch-series-10-airpods">September event</a>, Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They&#8217;re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple&#8217;s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple&#8217;s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple&#8217;s Find My app. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Although they launched at the end of last year, we&#8217;ve consistently been seeing discounts on both versions of the AirPods 4. Right now, for instance, the standard AirPods 4 are on sale for $119 ($10 off), which is about $20 of their all-time low price, at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-4%2F11381374703%2F" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>.

The latest refresh also ships with a USB-C charging case, as opposed to Lightning.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In 2022, Apple released the second-gen AirPods Pro, which feature a similar build to the first-gen model but offer better noise cancellation, swipe-based controls, and an extra-small pair of swappable silicone ear tips for smaller ears. Apple followed up a year later with a minor refresh, one that features a <a href="/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review">USB-C charging case</a> and an upgraded IP54 rating for water and dust resistance. The newest model also supports lossless audio when used with <a href="/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">Apple&#8217;s new Vision Pro headset</a> and <a href="/2024/9/12/24242929/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aids-fda-authorization">doubles as a pair of FDA-approved hearing aids</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As far as deals go, Apple&#8217;s updated AirPods Pro with USB-C are currently available at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Pro-2nd-generation-with-MagSafe-Case-USB-C%2F5689919121" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> for $188.56. That&#8217;s slightly better than their typical $199 sale price, but a far cry from their all-time low of $153.99.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best AirPods Max deals</h2><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Pink/dp/B0DGJKT2X9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple AirPods Max</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 480</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 549</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">13 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 480</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">Apple&#8217;s AirPods Max feature exemplary build quality, sound phenomenal, and keep up with the best at noise cancellation. <a href="/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features">Read our review</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The AirPods Max aren&#8217;t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They&#8217;re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple&#8217;s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They&#8217;re not the <a href="/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones">best noise-canceling headphones</a> for most people &#8212; blame the sticker price &#8212; but it&#8217;s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you&#8217;re an iPhone user.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">At the beginning of September, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with a <a href="/2024/9/17/24242378/airpods-max-usb-c-unchanged-missing-features">new model</a> that features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options. They&#8217;re currently on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Pink/dp/B0DGJKT2X9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Max-Orange%2F11375169740" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> starting at $479.99 ($70 off), which is their second-best price to date and $30 shy of their all-time low. Keep in mind that you can also occasionally pick up the first-gen model for less than $400, but right now, we&#8217;re not seeing any deals of note on the original pair.</p></div>
