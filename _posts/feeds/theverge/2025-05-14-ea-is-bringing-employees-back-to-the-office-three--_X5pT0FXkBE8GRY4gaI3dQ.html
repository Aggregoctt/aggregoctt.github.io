<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">EA is asking employees to return to the office for three days per week under a hybrid model &#8211; and it sounds like the company will be significantly reducing remote hiring. CEO Andrew Wilson and president of EA Entertainment and technology Laura Miele sent emails to staff about the change, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring">IGN reports</a>. Kotaku&#8217;s Ethan Gach <a href="/news/667401/eas-ceo-is-asking-staff-to-return-to-the-office">also reported</a> on Wilson&#8217;s email.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Corporate communications VP Justin Higgs confirmed the new hybrid model to The Verge. &#8220;We&#8217;ve adopted a globally consistent hybrid work model to bring teams together with greater clarity and intent &#8211; enabling faster decisions, sharper execution, and stronger connection to one another,&#8221; Higgs says. Hybrid roles will spend &#8220;at least three days a week in the office,&#8221; though there will be &#8220;flexibility&#8221; on other roles.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Miele&#8217;s email details how EA locations will have a 30-mile radius around them to help determine if an employee falls under the on site, hybrid, or remote model for work, IGN reports. Here&#8217;s what Miele says, per IGN:</p><ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1ymtmqpi _11h7yix0 _1xwtict1"><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Employees who live within 30-miles/48-km of an EA location will transition to a Hybrid work model.</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Employees who live outside the 30-mile/48-km radius will be considered remote unless their role is designated as On Site or Hybrid.</span></li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The &#8220;offsite local&#8221; work model is going to be sunset within 3 to 24 months. In addition, &#8220;any work model exception and future Remote hires will require a CEO Direct&#8217;s /my approval,&#8221; Miele&#8217;s email says, according to IGN.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The changes to EA&#8217;s policies follow recent layoffs of <a href="/news/658468/ea-layoffs-respawn-entertainment-titanfall-canceled">between 300 and 400 people</a>, layoffs at BioWare <a href="/news/604549/bioware-layoffs-shifts-mass-effect">announced in January</a>, and a <a href="/2024/2/28/24086085/ea-is-the-latest-gaming-company-to-lay-off-workers">layoff of about 5 percent of its staff early last year</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Update, May 14th</strong>: Noted that Ethan Gach also reported on Wilson&#8217;s email.</p></div>
