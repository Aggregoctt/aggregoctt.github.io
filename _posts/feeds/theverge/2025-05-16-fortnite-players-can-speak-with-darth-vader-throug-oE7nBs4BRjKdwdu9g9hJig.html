  they will be able to speak with the Sith Lord directly, and he’s going to respond

<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">When <a href="/news/661237/epic-games-fortnite-apple-us-ios-app-store-eu-account">Fortnite</a> players meet Darth Vader in <a href="/news/659347/fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle-season-battle-pass">the game&#8217;s ongoing Star Wars event</a>, they will be able to speak with the Sith Lord directly, and he&#8217;s going to respond with a voice that sounds exactly like <a href="/2014/1/19/5323642/james-earl-jones-doesnt-pay-much-attention-to-his-voice">James Earl Jones</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Though Darth Vader has previously appeared as an NPC (and a battle pass skin) in Fortnite, Epic Games announced today that the character&#8217;s latest outing will be a bit different thanks to the use of AI. After finding and defeating Vader on the map, players can recruit him onto their teams and speak directly with him using Fortnite&#8217;s in-game audio chat functionality. And Vader will respond in an AI recreation of James Earl Jones&#8217; iconic voice whose answers vary depending on what players.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Per a FAQ about the interactive feature, Epic says that Vader&#8217;s answers will be based on audio recordings of player&#8217;s voices that are sent directly to Gemini. Player audio and transcriptions of their voices will not be stored, though Epic will have access to transcriptions of Vader&#8217;s responses for instances in which players report what the character says. The company also says that it will &#8220;not use any of your interactions with Darth Vader to train AI models.&#8221; Additionally, players under the age of 13 or their country&#8217;s age of digital consent will need parental permission to use the feature.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The note about reporting Vader&#8217;s responses implies that the AI-voiced character might be able to say inappropriate things Epic, Disney, and Lucasfilm wouldn&#8217;t approve of. And, as Twitch streamer Loserfruit demonstrated earlier today, that seems to be very much the case.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/this-will-be-a-day-long-remembered-speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite">a statement</a> about the feature, Epic explained that Vader&#8217;s voice was created using <a href="/news/603821/google-gemini-flash-2-0-ai-app">Google&#8217;s Gemini 2.0 Flash</a> and <a href="/23864878/ai-voice-clones-podcastle-elevenlabs-personal-voice">ElevenLabs</a>&#8217; Flash v2.5 models. The studio also said Vader &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t be nearly as sinister&#8221; without Jones&#8217; performance, and thanked Jones&#8217; estate for signing off on the collaboration. Jones&#8217; family echoed Epic&#8217;s sentiments, and said that the late actor &#8220;always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience&#8221; Star Wars&#8217; with his voice in it.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character,&#8221; the family said.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Before <a href="/2024/9/9/24240301/james-earl-jones-darth-vader-voice-died">his death last September</a>, Jones signed off on a <a href="/2022/9/24/23370097/darth-vader-james-earl-jones-obi-wan-kenobi-star-wars-ai-disney-lucasfilm">deal with AI startup Respeecher</a> that gave the company the rights to recreate his voice for Disney Plus&#8217; <a href="/2022/5/27/23144221/obi-wan-kenobi-review-disney-plus">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> series. The deal was just one example of Disney and Lucasfilm&#8217;s desire to keep the Star Wars films and series running with <a href="/2022/2/2/22914062/the-book-of-boba-fett-star-wars-luke-skywalker-aging-cgi">digital recreations of its original cast</a>.</p></div>
