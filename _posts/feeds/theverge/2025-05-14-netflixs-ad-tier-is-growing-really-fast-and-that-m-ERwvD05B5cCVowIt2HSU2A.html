<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Netflix has more than doubled the number of people watching its ad-supported tier over the last year. At its upfront presentation for advertisers on Wednesday, the company revealed that <a href="/2025/1/21/24348682/netflix-price-increase-earnings-q4-2024">the $7.99 per month plan</a> now reaches more than 94 million users around the world each month &#8211; a big increase from the <a href="/2024/5/15/24157487/netflixs-ad-tier-40-million-subscribers">40 million it reported in 2024</a> and the <a href="/2024/11/12/24294560/netflix-ads-tier-70-million-subscribers">70 million it revealed last November</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The streaming giant&#8217;s ad tier <a href="/2022/11/3/23438971/netflix-basic-with-ads-what-you-cant-watch-padlock">has seen rapid growth since its debut in 2022</a>. As the service grows more comfortable with ads, it&#8217;s getting ready to debut more formats by the end of 2026, including pause ads, <a href="/2024/7/18/24201360/netflix-earnings-q2-2024-ads-advertising">which it first started experimenting with last year</a>, and interactive ads that appear in the middle of what you&#8217;re watching. Netflix stopped reporting how many total subscribers it adds each quarter, but it last said it had <a href="/2025/1/21/24348682/netflix-price-increase-earnings-q4-2024">over 300 million globally in January</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Amy Reinhard, Netflix&#8217;s president of advertising, said the streaming service has &#8220;the most engaged audience anywhere,&#8221; with subscribers on its ad-supported tier spending an average of 41 hours per month on the service.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The new ad formats are part of Netflix&#8217;s in-house advertising platform, which is now live in the US after arriving in Canada. It plans to bring the platform to all 12 countries with ad-supported plans by June. &#8220;The foundations of our ads business are in place,&#8221; Reinhard said. &#8220;And going forward, the pace of progress will be even faster.&#8221;</p></div>
