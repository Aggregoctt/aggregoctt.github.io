<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Plugable has <a href="https://plugable.com/products/ud-7400pd">announced a new docking solution</a> for Windows and Mac users that supports up to five simultaneous displays, including a mix of 4K and 8K. The new $279.95 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPGM58S1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">UD-7400PD dock</a> actually supports more displays than the <a href="/2024/12/17/24323277/another-thunderbolt-5-dock-joins-the-battle">pricier Thunderbolt 5 docks that have recently launched</a> which max out at three 4K screens. But Plugable&#8217;s latest comes with some performance limitations that could make it better suited for those wanting more screen real estate for spreadsheets and other productivity apps.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Unlike solutions such as <a href="/news/645134/caldigit-thunderbolt-5-dock-ts5-plus-pricing-availability">CalDigit&#8217;s recently announced $370 TS5 dock</a> that only supports a trio of 4K displays when connected to a computer that supports Thunderbolt 5, the Plugable UD-7400PD works with machines featuring at least a video-capable USB 3.2 Gen 2 port. That standard, supporting transfer rates of 10Gbps, debuted back in 2017, meaning Plugable&#8217;s new dock should work across a large number of existing PCs.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Using its two HDMI connections and three USB-C ports, the dock can drive up to five 4K 60Hz displays, three 8K 30Hz displays, or a combination of the two with four 4K screens plus an additional 8K one. It&#8217;s all made possible through Synaptics&#8217; new DisplayLink DL-7400 chipset and the DisplayLink technology that compresses video feeds on the host computer so they can be transmitted through slower USB-C ports which are then decompressed using dedicated hardware in the dock.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">You&#8217;ll need to install DisplayLink&#8217;s software on your computer to make it all work, and the approach could result in reduced performance for applications like games that produce a large amount of data. Apps like spreadsheets, by comparison, compress well because they&#8217;re relatively static. DisplayLink also doesn&#8217;t support High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) which could prevent you from watching content from streaming platforms like Netflix on the external displays.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The UD-7400PD dock also includes a front-facing 10Gbps USB-C port with 30W of power delivery and two 10Gbps USB-A ports. There&#8217;s also a 2.5Gbps ethernet port, a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack, and a host USB-C port that can charge laptops with up to 140W of power delivery. Given most productivity apps don&#8217;t require the latest and greatest processors and graphics cards, despite the few downsides of the technology, Plugable&#8217;s new dock provides an alternate path to an elaborate multi-screen setup without the added costs of upgrading all your gear to be Thunderbolt 5 compatible.</p></div>
