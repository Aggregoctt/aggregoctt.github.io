<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">OpenAI&#8217;s next &#8220;low-key research preview&#8221; has arrived.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">This time, it&#8217;s not ChatGPT, but a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhdpnbfH6NU">coding agent dubbed Codex</a> that is being made available to ChatGPT Pro, Enterprise, and Team subscribers starting Friday. By <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1923104360243835131">drumming up</a> comparisons to how ChatGPT was first described, CEO <strong>Sam Altman </strong>and other company leaders are positioning Codex as the company&#8217;s next major product. It doesn&#8217;t cost extra to use for now, though OpenAI plans to eventually charge for access once it gets a sense of demand.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The goal for Codex is to make ChatGPT a &#8220;virtual coworker&#8221; for engineers, <strong>Josh Tobin,</strong> OpenAI&#8217;s research lead for agents, said during a press call I attended this week. Like other vibe coding tools, Codex generates code from natural language. It can act independently on sandboxed code to fix bugs, run tests, and suggest changes to how code should run in the real world. This process can take anywhere up to 30 minutes, and OpenAI plans to let Codex work in the background for longer over time. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Codex is integrated into ChatGPT&#8217;s <a href="http://chatgpt.com/codex">web app</a> to start, but it&#8217;s intentionally cut off from being able to access the internet to mitigate security risks. It&#8217;s powered by a version of OpenAI&#8217;s o3 reasoning model that is customized for coding and called codex-1.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">According to Tobin, the company sees Codex as complementary to more granular AI coding assistants like Cursor and Windsurf, the latter of which OpenAI is in talks to acquire for roughly $3 billion. Inside OpenAI, Codex is already being used by engineers as a &#8220;morning to-do list&#8221; that helps them run multiple tasks in parallel. They have it spin up multiple tasks in parallel that they can come back to check on, according to <strong>Alexander Embiricos</strong>, Codex&#8217;s product lead. He said that a handful of companies that have tested it externally are seeing Codex used by on-call engineers who oversee a service&#8217;s stability.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">For now, Codex is relatively limited in what it can do autonomously. Eventually, OpenAI&#8217;s goal is for it to fully abstract away the complexity of coding. &#8220;The way that we think most development will happen in the future is that the agent will work on its own computer, and we&#8217;ll delegate to it,&#8221; said Embiricos. During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctcMA6chfDY">recent talk</a>, Altman described coding as &#8220;central to the future of OpenAI.&#8221; There&#8217;s a belief in Silicon Valley that whoever creates a general-purpose AI engineer, which Codex is supposed to become, will have an edge in the race to build artificial general intelligence. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Codex was what OpenAI called its first AI coding tool way back in 2021, before ChatGPT was released. Now, models helping people code is perhaps the hottest area of AI, with Anthropic and others betting heavily on it as a business. On Thursday, Windsurf <a href="https://windsurf.com/blog/windsurf-wave-9-swe-1">announced</a> its own suite of coding models. And earlier this week, Google&#8217;s Gemini <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/meet-alphaevolve-the-google-ai-that-writes-its-own-code-and-just-saved-millions-in-computing-costs/">added the ability</a> to connect to GitHub and announced <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/">AlphaEvolve</a>, an AI coding agent specifically designed for developing algorithms. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Speaking of Google, the company&#8217;s annual conference, I/O, happens to be next week. Given the rivalry between OpenAI and Google, the timing of this week&#8217;s Codex announcement is likely not a coincidence. We&#8217;ll see how Google responds.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Elsewhere</strong></h2><ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1ymtmqpi _11h7yix0 _1xwtict1"><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Airbnb&#8217;s Apple envy: </strong>A minimal, all-black stage. A company founder in a black shirt showing live demos from an iPhone to an audience. <strong>Jony Ive</strong> sitting in the front row. You may be thinking of an early Apple keynote, but that was what I witnessed in Los Angeles earlier this week at Airbnb&#8217;s &#8220;Summer Release&#8221; event. There, CEO <strong>Brian Chesky </strong>announced a new &#8220;Services&#8221; offering, a reboot of Airbnb Experiences, and an app redesign that would make <strong>Scott Forstall </strong>grin. <strong>Steve Jobs </strong>has inspired a generation of founders who want to present like him. I understand the impulse, but I&#8217;m ready to see a fresh take on what a tech keynote can be.
