<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Fender has released a free new recording app called <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fender.com%2Fpages%2Ffender-studio%23download-fender-studio" rel="sponsored">Fender Studio</a> that seems pretty powerful. The app, available on iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux, supports multitrack recording and offers a host of effects that emulate guitar pedals and several of the company&#8217;s iconic amplifiers over the years. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Some of the simulated amps include a 1965 Fender Twin Reverb and a 1959 Fender Bassman, but you can get more, like a Fender Super-Sonic or Tube Preamp, if you connect the app to a free Fender Connect account. It&#8217;s the same story with pedals: you get options like Overdrive and Small Hall Reverb to start, but you can unlock others like a Stereo Tape Delay and Vintage Tremolo by registering.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In addition to the simulated amps and pedals, the app has a variety of basic effects like reverb, delay, compression, and vocoder. You can use up to eight tracks for multitrack recording, but registering the app gets you up to 16 tracks. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The app also comes with a few pre-recorded tracks to play around with. You can&#8217;t use them commercially &#8212; the app makes you agree to a license agreement that says so right at the top &#8212; but they&#8217;re a good way to familiarize yourself with what it&#8217;s capable of. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I played around a little bit with Fender Studio on my iPhone before writing this story. At first glance, it&#8217;s similar to Apple&#8217;s GarageBand app. Both let you use effects that mimic classic amplifiers and pedals, have things like built-in tuners and metronomes, and include a number of different effects and EQ options.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But Fender&#8217;s app feels more intuitive and makes better use of the cramped space of a smartphone screen, with support for both landscape and portrait orientation (GarageBand only works in landscape). I find that I can never remember how to do things in GarageBand, and trying to figure it out each time is frustrating enough that I never bothered to develop a workflow for recording with it. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I&#8217;ve also always been a sucker for simulated amplifiers in recording apps, one area of software that never really gave up on skeuomorphism. I haven&#8217;t used a Twin Reverb in many years and haven&#8217;t played through a Bassman, but just recording with a hollow-body guitar through my iPhone&#8217;s built-in mic &#8212; if you have a USB-C DAC, you can use that to record with a more professional mic, too &#8212; the effect was decent enough that I could see using it to conceptualize a recording or even make a quick backing track for a video on TikTok.</p></div>
