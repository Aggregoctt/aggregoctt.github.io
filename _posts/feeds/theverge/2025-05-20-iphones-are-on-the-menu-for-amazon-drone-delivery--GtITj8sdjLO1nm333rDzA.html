<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has given Amazon&#8217;s Prime Air drones the go-ahead to deliver new categories of devices, including products with lithium ion batteries like iPhones, AirPods, and more, <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/amazon-drone-deliver-package">Amazon has announced</a>. The company says those product categories can be shipped to your door within 60 minutes &#8212; if you&#8217;re in one of the eligible delivery areas in Arizona or Texas, that is.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Amazon writes that it recently streamlined its drone deliveries. The new process includes Amazon giving you a delivery time with a five-minute window on either side, and customers no longer having to go outside and put a QR code on the ground.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The first time you order one of these drone drops, you&#8217;ll pick from one of the predetermined-to-be-eligible delivery zones on an aerial picture of your house. Amazon will use the same spot from then on, assuming it&#8217;s clear, until you change it. The drones drop packages from about 13 feet in the air, so it&#8217;s a good idea to keep your pets or kids inside during the delivery window. At the moment, drone deliveries are <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=T2t12Luq8BbER2CJ5X&amp;tag=theverge02-20">only available</a> in College Station, Texas, and in the West Valley part of the Phoenix, Arizona metro area, and only when the weather is favorable.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The deliveries come via Amazon&#8217;s new MK30 drones, a key part of the drone delivery program the company has been working to get off the ground for <a href="/2013/12/1/5164340/delivery-drones-are-coming-jeff-bezos-previews-half-hour-shipping">over a decade</a>. MK30s are limited to 5-pound packages, but they can fly farther than the drones it used previously, and can even <a href="/2024/4/22/24137383/amazon-prime-air-drone-delivery-closing-lockeford-california-phoenix-arizona">handle light rain</a>. Last year, Amazon managed to <a href="/2024/5/30/24167776/amazon-prime-air-delivery-drones-faa-bvlos-approval">get FAA approval</a> to fly its drones beyond the visual line of sight of its operators, greatly expanding where it can actually make its deliveries.</p></div>
