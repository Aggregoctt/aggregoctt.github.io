<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Product design requires considering lots of different things. How things look; how they work; how people will understand how to use them. Here&#8217;s one probably not on a lot of designers&#8217; lists, though: the insect enticement factor. Maybe that needs to change, because as The Verge&#8217;s <a href="/authors/william-poor">Will Poor</a> discovered, the way your gadgets are designed and made could have serious implications for what might decide to live inside them.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of The Vergecast</a>, Will tells us about his post-vacation Sonos discovery, how he discovered he&#8217;s not the only person on the internet trying to get the ants out of his speakers, and what he ultimately learned about insects and electronics. Some of the wild conspiracy theories are just that &#8212; but some might be for real.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong><strong>Subscribe: <a href="https://bit.ly/40Nhvbe">Spotify</a> | <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-vergecast/id430333725">Apple </a><a href="https://bit.ly/3R97G3Z">Podcasts</a> | <a href="https://bit.ly/3WSgkWW">Overcast</a> | <a href="https://bit.ly/4hMo2db">Pocket Casts</a> | <a href="https://bit.ly/3hkwRl2">More</a></strong></strong></p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">After that, The Verge&#8217;s <a href="/authors/andru-marino">Andru Marino</a> joins the show to talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGtINs3R5EM">the boom in AI-generated podcasts</a>.
