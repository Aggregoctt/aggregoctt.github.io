<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In the great big &#8216;ol list of games that are getting an adaptation you can now add Clash of Clans to the list. Supercell&#8217;s mobile strategy games Clash of Clans and Clash Royale, two of the biggest, highest grossing games in the world, will serve as the foundation for <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Ftudum%2Farticles%2Fclash-of-clans-series" rel="sponsored">a new animated series at Netflix</a>. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">According to Netflix, the show&#8217;s premise features, &#8220;a determined but in-over-his-head barbarian who must rally a band of misfits to defend their village and navigate the comically absurd politics of war.&#8221; The streaming platform has selected Fletcher Moules, director of several official Clash of Clans animated shorts, as the showrunner with Ron Weiner from 30 Rock and Silicon Valley joining him as the show&#8217;s writer.Video game adaptations are all the rage in Hollywood lately, aided by the critical success of shows like <a href="/tv-reviews/644415/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-hbo">The Last of Us</a> and <a href="/24126474/fallout-review-amazon-prime-video">Fallout</a>. Netflix itself has produced several successful adaptations including <a href="/24291592/arcane-season-2-review-netflix">Arcane: A League of Legends Story</a> and <a href="/23891310/netflix-castlevania-nocturne-review-konami-animated">Castlevania</a> making for an interesting synergy with the company&#8217;s own gaming offerings. And while Netflix Games offers a robust selection of casual and traditional games to play for free via subscription, Clash of Clans itself is not one of them.</p></div>
