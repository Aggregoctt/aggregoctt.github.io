<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Ahead of the release of the Lenovo Legion Go S running SteamOS later this month, Valve has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532097310616717411">announced a new compatibility rating system</a> for SteamOS devices. As the name implies, the new SteamOS Compatibility system will rate how compatible games are with third-party devices, similar to how Valve already rates the compatibility of games for its own Steam Deck.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The new rating will only show up on devices running SteamOS that aren&#8217;t a Steam Deck and are designed to quickly indicate to users if all of a game&#8217;s features and functionality, including any anti-cheat tools it may be using, are fully supported by the OS. Games will be marked as either &#8220;SteamOS Compatible&#8221; or &#8220;SteamOS Unsupported&#8221; in the Steam Store and Steam Client.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The rating &#8220;does not include testing results for performance and input, since we will not know (and have not tested) how all titles will run on all potential hardware,&#8221; as Valve points out in an announcement shared to its community pages yesterday. But the company expects &#8220;over 18,000 titles on Steam to be marked SteamOS compatible out of the gate.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Because the new ratings are &#8220;automatically generated from Steam Deck verification results without additional testing,&#8221; Valve says that developers don&#8217;t need to take any additional steps to ensure their games are compatible with third-party SteamOS devices. &#8220;If your title already has a Steam Deck Compatibility rating, an automated process will use that data to give it a SteamOS Compatibility rating.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Legion Go S will be the <a href="/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">first handheld gaming PC to trade Windows for SteamOS</a>, the gaming-focused operating system that powers Valve&#8217;s Steam Deck.</p></div>
