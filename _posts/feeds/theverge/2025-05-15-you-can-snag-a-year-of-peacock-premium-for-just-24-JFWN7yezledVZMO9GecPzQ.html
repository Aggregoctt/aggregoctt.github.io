<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">May and June are rarely considered the best time of year to land a streaming deal, though that doesn&#8217;t mean there aren&#8217;t ways to save if you can forgo big-name services like Netflix and Hulu. Now through May 30th, for instance, both new and returning subscribers can <a href="https://imp.i305175.net/c/482924/896948/11640?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2F" rel="sponsored">sign up for a year of ad-supported Peacock Premium</a> for just $24.99 ($55 off) when they use promo code <strong>SPRINGSAVINGS </strong>at checkout.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Admittedly, Peacock doesn&#8217;t carry the same kind of prestige as other services, but it still has plenty to offer in the way of TV shows and movies. The second season of Poker Face, Rian Johnson&#8217;s Columbo-inspired series starring Natasha Lyonne, <a href="/news/628186/poker-face-season-2-trailer-date-peacock">premiered less than a week ago</a>, and Oscar darling <a href="/2024/11/21/24301620/wicked-review">Wicked</a> made its streaming debut exclusively on Peacock just recently. And if you want something to look forward to, Greg Daniels&#8217; latest mockumentary series, a spinoff of The Office called The Paper, <a href="/news/665067/the-paper-date-image-peacock-office-spinoff">will hit the streaming platform in September</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">One caveat to keep in mind with Peacock&#8217;s ongoing promo is that you&#8217;ll be automatically charged the full subscription price (currently $79.99) at the end of the 12-month period. Thankfully, you can turn off Peacock&#8217;s auto-renew feature and still access the full slate of programming until the end of your billing cycle, ensuring you won&#8217;t be charged <a href="/23901586/streaming-service-prices-netflix-disney-hulu-peacock-max">whatever price hike</a> will inevitably go into effect before then.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">More ways to save today</h2><ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1ymtmqpi _11h7yix0 _1xwtict1"><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The cool weather might be winding down in many parts of the US, but if you&#8217;re someone who could still use a little heat in your home, <strong>Vornado&#8217;s vintage-looking Vheat</strong> is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078J6FXMN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">on sale at Amazon</a> in select colors starting at $120.24 (about $50 off). The simple space heater packs a lot of the same functionality as other Vornado models &#8212; it&#8217;s got two heat settings, an auto-off function, and a 47-degree pivoting head &#8212; only it sports an all-metal build that&#8217;s far more attractive than anything you might pick up at The Home Depot or Lowe&#8217;s.</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Once again, <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/.product.9536005.html" rel="sponsored">Costco has restocked</a> what might very well be the best <strong>Insta360 X5</strong> bundle out there, making it a great time to snag Insta360&#8217;s excellent action camera. The X5 can capture 4K footage up to 120fps, and like the last-gen X4, it can film in 8K up to 30fps or in 5.7K up to 60fps (with better low-light performance and the ability to swap lenses). The $549.99 package nets you a total of two batteries, a selfie stick, and a lens cap, along with a 256GB microSD card for stowing footage of all your adventures. <a href="/video/652887/insta360-x5-camera-review-2025">Read our review</a>.</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The delightfully unique <strong>Sharge Pouch</strong> is down to an all-time low of $49.99 ($50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7J513XG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> when you clip the on-page coupon for an additional $10 off. The compact, 40W USB-C charger is a bit different than your standard offerings from Anker and Baseus in that it functions as a wearable battery with a built-in cable, which allows you to easily take it with you on the go. Just ask our own Sean Hollister, who <a href="/2024/7/26/24207136/i-tried-the-sharge-pouch-a-power-bank-charger-cable-and-fashion-accessory-in-one">gave the chic(-ish) charger a whirl</a> last year.</span></li></ul></div>
