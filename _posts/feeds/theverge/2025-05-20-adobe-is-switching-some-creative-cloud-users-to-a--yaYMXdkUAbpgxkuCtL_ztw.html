<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Some of Adobe&#8217;s most expensive Creative Cloud subscriptions are about to get even pricier for users in North America. Starting from June 17th, the Creative Cloud All Apps plan will be <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/policy-pricing/changes-to-individual-plan.html">renamed Creative Cloud Pro</a> for users in the US, Canada, and Mexico, adding a bunch of generative AI perks in exchange for bumping up subscription costs.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The pre-tax monthly price for individual Creative Cloud All Apps subscribers on an annual contract will increase from $59.99 to $69.99, or from $659.88 to $779.99 annually. The monthly price for rolling, non-contracted subscribers will jump from $89.99 to $104.99. Contracted prices for teams start at <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/policy-pricing/changes-to-teams-plan.html">$99.99 per month</a>, up from $89.99, while student and teacher plans will jump from $34.99 to $39.99 monthly on renewal.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The new Creative Cloud Pro plan provides access to the same Adobe apps and features as the previous All Apps plan, alongside some new additions. Users will have unlimited credits for powering generative AI image tools like <a href="/2023/5/23/23734821/photoshop-generative-ai-fill-tool-adobe">Photoshop&#8217;s Generate Fill,</a> and 4,000 monthly credits for &#8220;premium&#8221; AI video and audio features like <a href="/news/641270/adobe-premiere-pro-generative-extend-generally-available">Generative Extend in Premiere Pro</a>. The plan also includes the ability to select third-party generative AI models like OpenAI&#8217;s GPT and Google Imagen, and access to Adobe&#8217;s in-beta collaborative whiteboard app, Firefly Boards.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;We want to empower you with more time to explore ideas and create, so we&#8217;re focused on continually upgrading your apps&#8217; performance, delivering innovations to your core workflows, and integrating generative AI-powered capabilities across Creative Cloud and through our new Firefly app that make you more productive,&#8221; <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/05/15/meet-creative-cloud-pro-new-tools-expansive-creative-controls">Adobe said in its announcement</a>. &#8220;Today, we&#8217;re sharing updates to our Creative Cloud offerings to reflect our continued innovation and commitment to providing you the best tools for bringing your visions to life.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The previous All Apps plan will no longer be available following the switch, and existing subscribers will be charged the increased price on their next renewal date. These changes only apply in North America, and Adobe says it isn&#8217;t planning to make name or pricing changes in other regions &#8220;<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/policy-pricing/plan-details-worldwide.html">at this time</a>.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Adobe is also offering a stripped-back &#8220;Creative Cloud Standard&#8221; plan for users who don&#8217;t need its generative AI offerings. Starting at $54.99 per month for contracted subscribers or $82.49 for rolling users, the Creative Cloud Standard plan is nearly identical to the current All Apps plan, but reduces the previous 1,000 monthly generative credit allowance down to 25. Users also won&#8217;t have access to premium web and mobile app features that are unlocked for Creative Cloud Pro subscribers. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Not only is Adobe defaulting current All Apps subscribers to the more expensive AI-laden plan, compared to the Standard offering that&#8217;s closer in price and features, but this new Creative Cloud Standard offering is only available to existing subscribers, forcing new customers to take the more expensive AI-focused plan.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Adobe&#8217;s All Apps plan was a poor investment for most individual users anyway, as it&#8217;s rare for one person to need more than 20 apps that target such a wide variety of creative industries. Still, some existing All Apps subscribers aren&#8217;t too pleased with the changes, if the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterEffects/comments/1kqgzt3/adobe_subscription_changes_announced_and_boy_do/">reactions on Adobe subreddits are any indication</a>. Canva attempted to make <a href="/2024/9/3/24234698/canva-price-increase-300-percent-ai-features">similar AI-driven price increases</a> last year, which were later <a href="/2024/10/9/24266269/canva-is-walking-back-some-of-its-pricing-changes">softened due to backlash</a> from its users, so we will have to see if Adobe sticks to its guns.</p></div>
