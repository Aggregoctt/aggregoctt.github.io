Upon installation, Pixel owners are greeted with a pop-up message on the home screen:</p><blockquote class="duet--article--blockquote ewrhy30 _1xwtict9"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Enjoy more space for apps</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Good news! Your home screen has a new layout, which means there&#8217;s space for more apps &amp; widgets</p></blockquote><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The new design both shrinks the At a Glance widget and removes some of the dead space between the other rows, compressing the entire screen. It leaves room for a full extra row of apps below the redesigned widget.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The bad news is that Google still won&#8217;t let you turn off the widget, which is a mandatory part of the Pixel home screen, just like the Google search bar at the bottom.

It was made available in the new Android 16 beta yesterday, and should roll out widely later this year, after the OS update launches in full next month.</p></div>
