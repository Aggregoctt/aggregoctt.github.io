<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft is making its Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) open-source today, opening up the code for community members to contribute to. After launching WSL for Windows 10 nearly nine years ago, it has been a multiyear effort at Microsoft to open-source the feature that enables a Linux environment within Windows.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;It has been a consistent request from the developer community for some time now,&#8221; says Windows chief Pavan Davuluri in an interview with The Verge. &#8220;It took us a little bit of time, because we needed to refactor the operating system to allow WSL to live in a standalone capacity that then allowed us to open-source the project and be able to have developers go and make contributions and for us to ingest those into the Windows pipeline and ship it at scale.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The WSL code is now <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL">available on GitHub</a>, allowing developers to download it and build it from source, participate in fixes, or even add new features. The WSL community hasn&#8217;t had access to Microsoft&#8217;s source code in the past, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped them from making contributions that have helped improve WSL over the years. Davuluri says he&#8217;s now expecting that developers will use the open-source project to help improve WSL performance, or for more integration into Linux services.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s a major milestone for WSL, which started off life in 2016 as part of the Windows 10 Anniversary update. &#8220;At that time WSL was based on a pico process provider, lxcore.sys, which enabled Windows to natively run ELF executables, and implement Linux syscalls inside the Windows kernel,&#8221; explains Pierre Boulay, senior software engineer at Microsoft. &#8220;Over time it became clear that the best way to provide optimal compatibility with native Linux was to rely on the Linux kernel itself.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft announced its second major version of WSL in 2019, eventually adding GPU support and then moving to ship the project separate to Windows. &#8220;It eventually became clear that to keep up the growing community and feature requests, WSL had to move faster, and ship separately from Windows,&#8221; says Boulay. &#8220;That&#8217;s why in 2021 we separated WSL from the Windows codebase, and moved it to its own codebase.&#8221; In the latest 24H2 update for Windows 11, Microsoft has fully transitioned WSL users to a package that&#8217;s separate from Windows, instead of the WSL component that was baked into the OS.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">All of these changes to WSL in recent years have led Microsoft to close off the first ever issue <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/1">raised on its WSL repo on GitHub</a>, asking &#8220;Will this be open-source?&#8221; That answer is very much yes now, and it&#8217;s a part of making Windows more developer-friendly. &#8220;Our goal is quite simple: we want Windows to be a great dev box for developers,&#8221; says Davuluri. &#8220;That&#8217;s really the ambition.&#8221;</p></div>
