<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Watching the behavior of our tech overlords has answered questions I&#8217;d never thought to ask. How do you NDA <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elon-musk-children-mothers-ashley-st-clair-grimes-dc7ba05c">an army of baby mamas</a>? Is there anything more embarrassing than <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/01/mark-zuckerberg-priscilla-chan-birthday-party-benson-boone-performance/">impersonating Benson Boone</a>? (Also, who is Benson Boone?) And now, the latest: how long after a sovereign ruler of a repressive state murders one of your columnists should you make a deal with him? The answer, it turns out, is a little over six years.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In October 2018, Jamal Khashoggi, a writer for the Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post, was killed and dismembered <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/25/971215788/biden-administration-poised-to-release-report-on-killing-of-jamal-khashoggi">with the approval of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman</a> (better known as MBS) after Khashoggi entered a Saudi consulate in Istanbul to get paperwork for his upcoming marriage. His body has never been found. On May 13th, Bezos&#8217; Amazon announced it would work with Humain, MBS&#8217; AI company, to build an &#8220;AI Zone&#8221; in Saudi Arabia &#8212; <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2025/5/aws-and-humain-announce-groundbreaking-ai-zone-to-accelerate-ai-adoption-in-saudi-arabia-and-globally">and the two companies will spend more than $5 billion in the process</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Saudi money is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1cdaadc3-b384-4f50-88ff-291c062c8376">old news in the tech industry</a> &#8212; the Public Investment Fund has sloshed into lots of startups, either directly or via intermediaries such as SoftBank. Morally bankrupt moneygrubbers such as Andreessen Horowitz have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/business/saudi-arabia-investment-artificial-intelligence.html?ref=oembed">been wooing Saudi funds for a while</a>. (Perhaps that&#8217;s the real reason <a href="/2024/7/24/24204706/marc-andreessen-ben-horowitz-a16z-trump-donations">they endorsed the Saudis&#8217; preferred candidate</a>?) This isn&#8217;t the first deal for Amazon, either. In March, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazons-aws-launch-saudi-arabia-data-centers-invest-over-53-bln-2024-03-04/">Amazon pledged to invest $5 billion </a>to build data centers in a country that&#8217;s scrambling to look futuristic. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In 2024, Saudi Arabia said it wanted to build an AI-powered economy. There&#8217;s a fancy website for <a href="https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en/overview/pillars/a-vibrant-society">Project 2030</a>, which I guess is meant to distract us from all the oil money. That date isn&#8217;t a coincidence &#8212; <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/peak-oil-demand-is-still-a-decade-away">many projections say that&#8217;s when oil production will peak</a> and then decline. Regardless of when the actual peak occurs, a global shift away from petroleum threatens Saudi Arabia&#8217;s wealth. That&#8217;s why the country is behaving like a dipshit startup.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><a href="/2022/7/26/23278795/saudi-arabia-neom-the-line-mirror-design-plans-pictures-renders">Take Neom</a>, billed as the city of the future, vaporware at a previously unimagined scale that also served as a &#8220;key tool&#8221; for MBS to consolidate power, <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/sada/2021/04/saudi-arabias-neom-diplomacy?lang=en">according to Ali Dogan</a>, a researcher at the Leibniz-Zentrum Moderner Orient in Berlin. Khashoggi&#8217;s murder was a blow to the project, as luminaries such as OpenAI&#8217;s Sam Altman and former US energy secretary Ernest Moniz <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-neom-megacity-2018-10">suspended their involvement</a>. A number of companies publicly renounced Saudi money &#8212; at least, for a while. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">Does the freedom to assassinate count as one of the personal liberties Bezos claims to treasure?</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Neom is moving down the entirely predictable vaporware path. It keeps getting <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ed62de6a-fa99-471d-a479-58463e86e523">delayed and downsized</a>, which makes sense because it&#8217;s no longer the city of the future and a spectacular investment opportunity once it&#8217;s built &#8212; it&#8217;s just another city. But, according to Saudi officials, we won&#8217;t have to worry about that for another 50, or possibly 100, years. In the meantime, though, contracts! Investment! AI!</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Look, I don&#8217;t expect ethics out of <a href="/2025/1/20/24346317/trump-gangster-tech-regulation-corruption-grift">Altman or any of his ilk</a>. But for basic reasons of maintaining employee morale, I would hesitate to invest in a state that literally murdered one of my contractors. And didn&#8217;t merely murder him &#8212; but dismembered and then disappeared him. An opportunity the state had only because Khashoggi wanted to get married. Murder is bad enough, but every single detail makes it worse.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Lately, it seems Bezos has been dismantling the Washington Post, one of the US&#8217; premier journalistic institutions &#8212; putting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/business/media/washington-post-buzbee-lewis.html">British failure machine Will Lewis</a>, known for his role in the UK phone-hacking scandal, in charge. Last year, the <a href="/2024/10/25/24279602/jeff-bezos-washington-post-kamala-harris-endorsement">Post didn&#8217;t endorse a candidate</a> in the US presidential race for the first time since 1960, resulting in <a href="/2024/10/28/24282076/jeff-bezos-washington-post-cancellations-endorsement">more than 200,000 canceled subscriptions</a>. Its stars have been fleeing in droves. (Ann Telnaes, who was <a href="https://anntelnaes.substack.com/p/why-im-quitting-the-washington-post">driven to quit</a> the Post after a cartoon making fun of Bezos was killed, recently won a Pulitzer Prize for her work. Oops!) Now, after all Bezos&#8217; posturing about the free press, he&#8217;s cutting deals with people who murder journalists for saying inconvenient things. But maybe we should have seen that coming when he banned <a href="/news/619887/jeff-bezos-washington-post-opinion-section-limits-free-speech-markets">op-ed writers from opposing &#8220;free speech and the markets.&#8221;</a> Does the freedom to assassinate count as one of the personal liberties Bezos claims to treasure?</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s all so spineless. I mean, we already know that <a href="/2020/1/24/21080968/jeff-bezos-hack-phone-lauren-michael-sanchez-texts-national-enquirer">MBS may have hacked Bezos&#8217; phone</a>, but I guess that&#8217;s water under the bridge. Or maybe not. Maybe MBS got something real good in that hack. Impossible to say whether this is motivated by kompromat or greed, I suppose. But whatever the motive, we know one thing: it takes five years for Bezos to go from posting his <a href="https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/1220059386694922240">photo op with the headstone of a murdered reporter</a> to making billion-dollar deals with his killer.</p></div>
