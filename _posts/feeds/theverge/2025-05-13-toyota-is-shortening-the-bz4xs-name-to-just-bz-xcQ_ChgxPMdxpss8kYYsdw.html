<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Toyota&#8217;s flagship electric vehicle with the clunky name, <a href="/23180408/toyota-bz4x-electric-suv-review-specs-price">the bZ4x</a>, is getting a makeover for the 2026 model year &#8212; including a much shorter moniker.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Now styled as just bZ, the compact SUV is also getting more range, thanks to expanded battery capacity, and an improved design. The front-wheel drive bZ with 74.7 kWh battery will be able to travel an estimated 314 miles on a single charge, while a 57.7 kWh battery option for the front-wheel drive version will get just 236 miles. Toyota said it would announce prices closer to the date when the new bZ arrives at dealerships, which is expected later this year.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">And speaking of, another welcome upgrade is <a href="/2023/10/19/23924413/toyota-lexus-tesla-nacs-supercharger-electric-vehicle-charging-2025">the inclusion of Tesla&#8217;s North American Charging Standard (NACS)</a>, which means the Toyota bZ will be able to power up at any available Tesla Supercharger station.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Charging was always <a href="/23180408/toyota-bz4x-electric-suv-review-specs-price">a major challenge for the bZ4X</a>, so its nice to see Toyota taking those criticisms to heart. The automaker is also adding Plug and Charge capability, meaning the bZ will be able to pull up to any third-party charging station, plug in, and the driver&#8217;s account will be automatically billed without any apps to sign up for or QR codes to scan.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The bZ4X has always been kind of a sleeper hit for Toyota. After a slow start, <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/755382/bz4x-solterra-sales-increase-q1/">sales of the EV shot up late last year</a> and early this year, thanks in part to discounts and lease deals. Toyota said it sold 5,610 bZ4Xs in the first quarter of 2025, compared to only 1,897 in Q1 2024.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">The bZ4X has always been kind of a sleeper hit for Toyota</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The new 2026 bZ will be more of a mover in other ways for Toyota. The automaker is boosting the horsepower by up to 50 percent to 338 combined system net hp in the all-wheel drive model. This was achieved by including silicon carbide semiconductors in the motors for improved power delivery. The bZ can now accelerate from 0&#8211;60mph in 4.9 seconds.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The exterior design is now a lot cleaner and approachable. Gone are the black wheel arches, replaced with panels that match the vehicle&#8217;s paint color for a more cohesive look. The interior has also been updated with a new center console and a new instrument panel, with a larger 14-inch center touchscreen. And Apple CarPlay and Android Auto can be used wirelessly.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The new bZ is built on the same E-TNGA platform that undergirds the bZ4X, the Lexus RZ 450e, and the Subaru Solterra. Toyota is currently pumping $1.3 billion into its Kentucky factory for EV production, <a href="/2024/2/7/24063943/toyota-ev-investment-kentucky-factory-three-row-suv">including a planned three-row SUV</a>.</p></div>
