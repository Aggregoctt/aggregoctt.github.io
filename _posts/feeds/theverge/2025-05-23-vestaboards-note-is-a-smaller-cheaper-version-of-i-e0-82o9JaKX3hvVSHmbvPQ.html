excerpt: The original Vestaboard revived and modernized the split-flap mechanical
  displays that were once a mainstay of airports and train stations around the world,
  but at $3,499 it put a steep price on nostalgia. Its creators are back with a new
  version called the Vestaboard Note that’s much smaller and more affordable. It’s
  available for preorder [&#8230;]

<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <a href="/circuitbreaker/2018/1/11/16876582/vestaboard-mechanical-split-flap-display-internet-train-sign-ces-2018">original Vestaboard</a> revived and modernized the <a href="/2024/10/31/24283510/miniot-klapklok-low-resolution-wall-clock-price">split-flap mechanical displays</a> that were once a mainstay of airports and train stations around the world, but at $3,499 it <a href="https://shop.vestaboard.com/products/vestaboard">put a steep price on nostalgia</a>. Its creators are back with a new version called the <a href="https://www.vestaboard.com/news/meet-vestaboard-note">Vestaboard Note</a> that&#8217;s much smaller and more affordable. It&#8217;s <a href="https://shop.vestaboard.com/products/vestaboard-note?variant=52006738231660">available for preorder now</a>, starting at $899 &#8211; discounted from $1,299 &#8211; with deliveries expected to begin in December 2025.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The company had spent over a year developing a new version of the Vestaboard called the Smart Bits that was &#8220;a completely new way to experience Vestaboard&#8217;s patented character units&#8221; that also &#8220;pushed the limits of design, engineering, and manufacturing,&#8221; according to the company&#8217;s founder and CEO, Dorrian Porter. But, when faced with economic uncertainty as a result of <a href="/tech/607947/donald-trump-tariffs-china-mexico-canada-explainer">President Trump&#8217;s tariffs</a> on Chinese-made goods, the company pivoted and instead created the Note.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Functionally, the Note is nearly identical to the original Vestaboard. But instead of using 132 split-flap mechanisms, which the company calls Bits, the Note only features 45. Each can display 64 alphanumeric characters plus other symbols like punctuation, solid colors, and a newly added red heart. The display measures 24.5 inches wide, or 28.4 inches with an optional bezel frame that adds $169 to the full retail pricing.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Messages, patterns, and images can be created using a web interface or a free accompanying mobile app for iOS and Android. They&#8217;re sent to the Note over Wi-Fi or an Ethernet cable. In addition to a library of existing designs and inspirational quotes, the app allows messages to be scheduled, sent to other Vestaboard users you&#8217;re friends with, or even silenced during certain hours of the day. As hypnotic as the sound of over 2,800 spinning flaps may be, you probably don&#8217;t want the Vestaboard Note waking you up in the middle of the night.</p></div>
