<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In a pretty barebones <a href="https://news.ricoh-imaging.co.jp/rim_info2/2025/20250522_041009.html">press release</a> accompanied by a couple of pictures and <a href="https://news.ricoh-imaging.co.jp/rim_info2/2025/20250522_041009.html#:~:text=Major%20Specifications">detailed specs</a>, Ricoh surprise announced that its long-awaited GR IV camera will launch this fall. The GR IV will adhere closely to the design of the <a href="/2018/9/28/17913212/ricoh-griii-camera-apsc-hands-on-photokina-2018">GR III from 2018</a>, and it will continue to use an autofocusing 28mm-equivalent f/2.8 lens and only a rear LCD for composing photos and videos, with no electronic or optical viewfinder available.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The GR IV&#8217;s exterior looks very similar to the GR III / <a href="/24118170/fujifilm-x100vi-ricoh-gr-iiix-point-shoot-camera-comparison">GR IIIx</a>, with an oval-shaped shutter button, on / off switch and mode dial up top, and a smattering of rear controls to the right of its LCD. Its buttons look redesigned, removing the spinning dial from around its four-way directional pad. And its adjustment thumb wheel, labeled &#8220;ADJ,&#8221; looks like it may be a fully turning dial instead of just a back-and-forth toggle that moves left or right. (I may be wishcasting that last part, because I think the thumb toggle on the GR III is annoying and fiddly.)</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">What&#8217;s known for certain based on its spec list is that the GR IV retains the built-in ND filter of the GR III, but it slightly ups the resolution of its large APS-C sensor from 24 megapixels to 26. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It will also have a higher ISO range that reaches 204,800 at its maximum setting, and five-axis stabilization instead of three-axis stabilization. The GR IV&#8217;s lens may be the same focal length and maximum aperture as previous generations, but it&#8217;s a new seven-element design in a new arrangement utilizing an additional aspherical element that should yield better corrections. The upcoming camera will also have face and eye-detection for its autofocus tracking, and 53GB of usable built-in storage. Onboard storage is great, and it&#8217;s much more than the GR III&#8217;s 2GB, but the GR IV is also downsizing from full-size SD cards to microSD.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">While there isn&#8217;t a price yet, Ricoh has confirmed the GR IV is expected to release in the autumn of 2025, with a variant featuring a <a href="/24158218/ricoh-gr-iii-hdf-full-frame-video">Highlight Diffusion Filter</a> (HDF) to come &#8220;after winter 2025.&#8221; The announcement also details that the GR III is scheduled to be discontinued in July, while the GR IIIx continues &#8220;for the time being.&#8221; The Ricoh GR cameras have carved out a niche among street photographers who value their super compact size and fairly affordable prices compared to a <a href="/2024/2/21/24079251/people-have-very-strong-opinions-about-fujfilms-latest-camera">Fujifilm X100</a> or <a href="/2023/5/25/23736639/leica-q3-camera-28mm-fixed-lens-compact-8k-availability-price-specs">Leica Q</a>. As cool and fun as I thought the just-announced <a href="/news/672268/fujifilm-x-half-digital-compact-camera-fixed-lens-analog-price-specs">Fujifilm X Half</a> might be, the GR IV has instantly become my most anticipated camera of 2025.</p></div>
