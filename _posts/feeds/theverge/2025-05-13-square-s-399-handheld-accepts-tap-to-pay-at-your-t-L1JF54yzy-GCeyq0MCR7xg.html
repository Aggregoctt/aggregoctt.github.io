excerpt: The Square Handheld is available today for $399 with support for traditional
  card transactions and tap-to-pay, scanning products, and managing inventory, all
  from a single device. That should bring tap-to-pay acceptance without an iPhone
  to more places in the businesses and restaurants where youâ€™re already used to seeing
  the Square Stand and other similar setups. [&#8230;]

<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Square Handheld is available today for $399 with support for traditional card transactions and tap-to-pay, scanning products, and managing inventory, all from a single device. That should bring tap-to-pay acceptance without an iPhone to more places in the businesses and restaurants where you&#8217;re already used to <a href="/2022/4/11/23020499/square-ipad-point-of-sale-stand-built-in-payments-reader">seeing the Square Stand</a> and other similar setups.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Weighing in at 11 ounces (about 311 grams) and measuring less than an inch thick, Square says this is &#8220;one of the thinnest and lightest handheld point of sale devices on the market.&#8221; That makes the Handheld easier to lug around than <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsquareup.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fhardware%2Fterminal" rel="sponsored">Square&#8217;s wedge-shaped Terminal POS device</a>, and provides some competition for <a href="https://www.clover.com/flex">Clover&#8217;s $749 Flex system</a>. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Square Handheld includes a splash and dust-resistant 6.2-inch touchscreen, a barcode scanner, and a 16 megapixel camera. Square says that the battery provides enough juice to &#8220;power through a whole day.&#8221; Belkin is also offering SheerForce protective cases for the Handheld starting at $39, which can help businesses to better tailor the device to their brand identity and bolster it against damage.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Square has also redesigned its POS app, giving the Handheld access to seven modes that can be customized with industry-specific features such as Quick Service mode, Bar mode, and Retail mode.</p></div>
