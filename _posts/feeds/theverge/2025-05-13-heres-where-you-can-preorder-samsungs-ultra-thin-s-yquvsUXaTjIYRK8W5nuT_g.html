<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">At its virtual Unpacked event on Tuesday, Samsung officially <a href="/samsung/664844/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-thin-phone-price-release-date-impressions">announced the launch date</a> for its new ultra-slim Galaxy S25 Edge. The latest S25 series phone launches on May 30th to the tune of $1,099, with preorders starting today at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Processor-Manufacturer/dp/B0F2GSF21H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s25-edge-512gb-unlocked-titanium-silver%2F6624975.p%3FskuId%3D6624975" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/92g17potvn3zo">Samsung&#8217;s online storefront</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">At just 5.8mm thick, the Galaxy S25 Edge is Samsung&#8217;s thinnest phone yet. It weighs about 5.7 ounces, making it surprisingly light for a 6.7-inch device. While its slim design means it comes with a smaller 3,900mAh battery, Samsung didn&#8217;t sacrifice durability to achieve the phone&#8217;s slender design. In fact, despite its thin and lightweight build, the Edge features the same rugged titanium frame as the <a href="/reviews/604154/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-ai-screen-battery">S25 Ultra</a> and carries an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. It also shares the Ultra&#8217;s 200-megapixel main camera, though it&#8217;s limited to two rear lenses with no telephoto lens.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Other than that, the S25 Edge is largely similar to the <a href="/reviews/610404/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review-screen-battery-camera">S25 Plus</a>. Both feature a 6.7-inch OLED display and run on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chipset. They also offer the same Galaxy AI features, including natural language search for both photos and other settings. Like the rest of the S25 lineup, the S25 Edge is backed by Samsung&#8217;s promise of seven years of OS and security updates.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">We&#8217;ll be reviewing the S25 Edge in the coming days, but if you&#8217;re looking to place a preorder now, here&#8217;s what you should know.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Where to preorder the Galaxy S25 Edge</h2><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Processor-Manufacturer/dp/B0F2GSF21H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge (512GB)</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 1100</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 1220</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">10 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 1100</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">The 6.7-inch Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is the thinnest phone Samsung has ever made. It comes with a titanium frame and a 200-megapixel main shooter, though its sleek design also means it comes with the smallest battery in the S25 lineup.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Galaxy S25 Edge starts at $1,099, features 12GB of RAM, and comes in two storage configurations: 256GB and 512GB, with the latter going for $120 more.
