<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Today, DJI is officially announcing the Mavic 4 Pro, which could be the most versatile drone it&#8217;s ever made. It&#8217;s the first with a 360-degree rotating gimbal for footage that tilts, rolls, and offers true vertical filming. It&#8217;s the first Mavic to offer 51 minutes of battery life, <a href="http://or%2051%20minutes%20with%20the%20Intelligent%20Flight%20Battery%20Plus">tied with the old Mini 3</a> and close to the <a href="https://nofilmschool.com/dji-matrice-350-rtk-done">longest flight times</a> DJI has achieved. It&#8217;s the first with a built-in 100-megapixel camera, which can also record 6K/60fps HDR, as part of its triple-camera array.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Another important distinction: it&#8217;s the first off-the-shelf DJI drone that won&#8217;t launch in the United States.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Today, it&#8217;s going on sale in Canada, Mexico, and every other country where DJI sells drones, but the company tells The Verge it has no timeline on bringing it to the US. DJI won&#8217;t honor its limited warranty if you cross the border to purchase one in Canada or Mexico. It&#8217;s not even sending the drone to US-based technology reviewers &#8212; we don&#8217;t have one, and we&#8217;re not sure when we&#8217;ll get one.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Why is the Chinese drone maker doing this? The company says <a href="/news/664811/us-china-pause-tariffs-90-days">Trump&#8217;s tariffs</a> were among the top reasons it chose to abandon a US launch &#8212; and there&#8217;s also the fact that, seven months later, <a href="/2024/10/16/24272188/dji-blames-us-customs-block-import-some-drones">US Customs is still holding up DJI&#8217;s ability</a> to import drones into the country. Last October, DJI said that a &#8220;misunderstanding&#8221; initially forced the company to abandon its plans to offer the Air 3S at retail; this time, DJI may not sell its new drone here at all.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">We sent the company over a dozen questions about this decision, and you can find full answers at the bottom of this post. But before we go there, let&#8217;s first dive into all that&#8217;s new with the Mavic 4 Pro.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">With a starting price of roughly between $2,000 and $2,500 based on currency conversion rates (it&#8217;s $2,049 CAD in Canada, $50,999 in Mexico, &#8364;2,099 in Europe, &#163;1,879 in the UK, and $3,099 in Australia), the Mavic 4 Pro isn&#8217;t cheap &#8212; but it&#8217;s not far off the price of its predecessor <a href="/2023/4/25/23696076/dji-mavic-3-pro-cine-launch">the Mavic 3 Pro</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">While it only weighs about 3 ounces (105g) more than its triple-camera predecessor, the 2.3-pound (1.06kg) Mavic 4 Pro offers up eight more minutes of flight time from its new 95Wh pack, <a href="https://repair.dji.com/help/content?customId=en-us03400006564&amp;spaceId=34&amp;re=US&amp;lang=en">the most battery capacity DJI&#8217;s ever put in a consumer drone</a> and just shy of the typical limit for lithium batteries that you can bring on a plane. All three of its cameras now offer 4K 120fps modes, in addition to 4K60 HDR, and the gimbal can tilt up twice as far (70 degrees) for upward shooting.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">You also get 64GB of internal storage &#8212; up from 8GB. DJI will also sell a &#8220;Creator Combo&#8221; with a 512GB SSD and a proprietary 240W power adapter and charging hub to charge up three batteries more quickly.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Top speed is now nearly 56 miles per hour (90 kilometers per hour), up from nearly 47 mph (75.6 kph) previously, and it can travel over 25 miles (41km) on a charge, up from its predecessor&#8217;s 17 miles (28km). Not that you can send it quite that far away, as its maximum transmission range has merely doubled to 18.6 miles (30km).</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">While DJI&#8217;s sticking with the same specs for its 70mm medium tele camera (1/1.3-inch 48MP sensor, f/2.8 aperture), the 168mm telephoto&#8217;s had a bit of upgrade, with a slightly larger 1/1.5-inch, 50MP sensor (up from 1/2-inch, 12MP) and a slightly wider f/2.8 aperture (compare to f/3.4), both of which could let it capture more light. And speaking of light, DJI says its omnidirectional avoidance now works in low light at up to 18 meters per second (roughly 40 mph), significantly faster than the Mavic 3 Pro (27 mph) or even <a href="/2024/10/15/24269740/dji-air-3s-drone-specs-price">the Air 3S</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Also it can pull the same trick as the Air 3S where it can map its path using forward facing LiDAR sensors, then return-to-home without needing GPS satellite signals; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzWIYOOKItM">here&#8217;s a video DJI produced</a> to show that off with the Air:</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">DJI&#8217;s also touting its new-for-Mavic tracking abilities: &#8220;Once tracking begins, Mavic 4 Pro can keep a subject in focus even if partially obscured by bushes or if they are standing on a bridge. It also detects vehicles up to 200m with directional awareness, ideal for delivering professional-grade automotive cinematography,&#8221; the company brags.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Today DJI is also announcing a new controller called the DJI RC Pro 2, which comes with some pretty neat tricks. Its large 7-inch screen is on a folding arm that automatically folds down the joysticks for easy transport &#8212; no more screwing and unscrewing! It automatically powers on the controller when you open it and the whole screen&#8217;s on a swivel so you can rotate it for vertical filming. It&#8217;s also got an HDMI port, 128GB of built-in storage, and a high price: &#8364;999 / &#163;879 / CAD $999 all by its lonesome, or bundled in DJI&#8217;s priciest combo kits.</p><h2 class="_10m8eym3">Mavic 4 Pro pricing</h2>ItemCanada(tax not included)Mexico(includes tax)UK(includes tax)Europe(taxes varies by country, so prices can vary)Australia(includes tax)Japan(includes tax)New Zealand(includes tax)DJI Mavic 4 Pro$2,049 CAD$50,9991,879 GBP2,099 euro$3,099 AUD277,200 yen$3,599 NZDFly More Combo (DJI RC 2)$2,799 CAD$68,3692,459 GBP2,699 euro$4,039 AUD497,860 yen$4,585 NZD512GB Creator Combo (DJI RC Pro 2)$3,459 CAD$87,5993,209 GBP3,539 euro$5,359 AUD497,860 yen$6,015 NZDDJI RC Pro 2$999 CAD$18,999879 GBP999 euro$1,529 AUD158,400 yen$1,629 NZD<p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">So, what exactly is DJI saying now that <a href="/news/664811/us-china-pause-tariffs-90-days">Trump&#8217;s biggest tariffs on China have been paused for 90 days</a>? The pause won&#8217;t change what happens today with the launch. &#8220;That said, we&#8217;re currently reassessing the market conditions and developments, and will share any updates once we have completed a full evaluation. Please rest assured that we are making every effort to protect the interests of our customers,&#8221; reads an emailed statement from DJI spokesperson Daisy Kong.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Here are the other questions we sent DJI, and the company&#8217;s responses.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Will the DJI Mavic 4 Pro go on sale in the United States?
