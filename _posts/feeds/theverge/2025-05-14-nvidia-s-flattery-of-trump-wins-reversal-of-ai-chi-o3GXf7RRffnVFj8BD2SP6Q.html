<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Nvidia&#8217;s efforts to suck up to the Trump administration have seemingly paid off, with the US now lifting export limits on US-made AI chips and cracking down on anyone using Huawei&#8217;s emerging alternatives. The announcements come as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang joined President Trump in Saudi Arabia this week to solicit AI investments for US companies.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <a href="https://media.bis.gov/sites/default/files/documents/05.07%20Recission%20of%20AI%20Diffusion%20Press%20Release.pdf">US Department of Commerce (DOC) announced on Monday</a> that it has rescinded the <a href="/2025/1/13/24342595/nvidia-flatter-trump-biden-administration-ai-chip-restrictions">Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule</a>, due to take effect on May 15th, that aimed to restrict how many US-made AI chips could be sent to international markets without special government approval. The DOC said that a replacement rule for protecting US AI technology will be issued &#8220;in the future,&#8221; but provided no specific details.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;These new requirements would have stifled American innovation and saddled companies with burdensome new regulatory requirements,&#8221; The DOC said in a statement. &#8220;The AI Diffusion Rule also would have undermined US diplomatic relations with dozens of countries by downgrading them to second-tier status.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">While the goal was to prevent countries already subject to chip restrictions, such as Russia and China, from accessing or building AI tech, it also placed Nvidia&#8217;s estimated 90 percent share of the AI chip market in jeopardy. Shortly after the Diffusion Rule was introduced by former President Joe Biden in January, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-policy/">Nvidia issued a statement</a> calling it &#8220;misguided,&#8221; while anticipating a return to Trump&#8217;s first term policies &#8220;that strengthen American leadership, bolster our economy and preserve our competitive edge in AI and beyond.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The DOC also warned companies that using Huawei&#8217;s Ascend AI chipset &#8220;anywhere in the world&#8221; would violate US export control agreements. Huawei&#8217;s home-grown Ascend processors are seen as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/chinas-huawei-develops-new-ai-chip-seeking-to-match-nvidia-8166f606?mod=Searchresults_pos1&amp;page=1">China&#8217;s best answer</a> to Nvidia&#8217;s powerful AI chips. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Nvidia&#8217;s Huang was notably one of the only US tech leaders to <a href="/2025/1/17/24345987/nvidia-jensen-huang-skips-trumps-inauguration">not attend Donald Trump&#8217;s inauguration</a>. His absence doesn&#8217;t appear to have soured the relationship between them, however, with Huang spotted cosying up to Trump at a US-Saudi investment summit in Riyadh on Tuesday, alongside other tech leaders like Elon Musk, AMD&#8217;s Lisa Su, OpenAI&#8217;s Sam Altman, and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/05/13/trump-tech-execs-riyadh/">The Washington Post reports</a> that Trump was far from subtle about what the US wanted from the gathering. &#8220;As you know, we have the biggest business leaders in the world here,&#8221; he told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. &#8220;They&#8217;re going to walk away with a lot of checks for a lot of things that you&#8217;re going to provide.&#8221;</p></div>
