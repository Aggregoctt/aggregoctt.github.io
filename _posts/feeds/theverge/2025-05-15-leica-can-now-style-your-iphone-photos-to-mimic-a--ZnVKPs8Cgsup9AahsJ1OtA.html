<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Leica is bringing a new kind of filter effect called &#8220;Artist Looks&#8221; to its <a href="/2024/6/6/24172452/leica-lux-iphone-app-announced-camera-lens-profiles">Lux camera app</a> for iPhones, with the first one adjusting your photos to resemble the style and body of work of celebrity photographer <a href="https://gregwilliams.com/">Greg Williams</a>. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Artist Looks, like the other color and black-and-white looks in Leica&#8217;s app, are essentially one-click filter presets for easy photo editing. It&#8217;s the first time Leica Camera has collaborated with a pro on looks designed to mimic their personal aesthetic. In Williams&#8217;s case, his Artist Look is lightly inspired by Kodak Tri-X film, converting your color photos to black and white &#8212; with the white point shifted a touch to make the whites slightly off-white and yielding a more vintage warm-tone feel.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Leica Lux app update version 1.7 <a href="https://lux.leica-camera.com/XYDx/avpm44w3">on the iOS App Store</a> will offer the Greg Williams look for Lux Pro account subscribers paying $6.99 per month or $69.99 annually, or included for anyone who buys <a href="/news/607434/leica-lux-grip-apple-iphone-photography-camera">Leica&#8217;s phone grip</a> that <a href="https://leicacamerausa.com/leica-lux-grip.html">now costs $625</a> <a href="/news/660197/leica-us-tariff-camera-price-increase-canada">post-tariffs</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Lux app is Leica&#8217;s dedicated camera app for iPhones, allowing free and paid users to take smartphone pictures with a bit of Leica&#8217;s color science. In addition to a selection of Leica-tuned photo filters like Classic, Chrome, and one based on the vintage Leica I Model A camera, the app also offers some signature looks taken from specific Leica lenses. The in-app &#8220;lenses&#8221; are essentially portrait mode processing recipes modeled after lenses like the 50mm f/1.2 Noctilux or a 35mm f/1.4 Summilux.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Leica is also releasing an update to its Fotos app that allows owners of the Leica Q3, Q3 43, SL3 and SL3-S to download the Greg Williams look directly into their cameras. And if you don&#8217;t have one of those newer models, the Fotos app can apply the filter to JPG files shot with any Leica with Wi-Fi that can upload images to the app. There&#8217;s no paywall for the Artist Look in the Fotos app, other than the barrier to entry of owning an actual Leica.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Photo filters and film recipes are nothing new to mobile photography or users of Fujifilm cameras. While Fujifilm leans on its own film stocks for reference in its popular <a href="/24118170/fujifilm-x100vi-ricoh-gr-iiix-point-shoot-camera-comparison">X100</a> line, other camera-makers typically go the standard route (vivid, neutral, etc.) or get creative, like <a href="/24161722/panasonic-lumix-s9-full-frame-camera">Panasonic&#8217;s Lumix S9 camera</a> and its many custom profiles. This new way of leaning on a pro photog&#8217;s own style is certainly novel. It might be cool to see some iconic Leica photographers get their own Artist Look, if I&#8217;m ever strolling down the street and feeling a little Elliott Erwitt-y. Though, I imagine some pros may charge a pretty penny to cop their style.</p></div>
