<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Toyota <a href="https://pressroom.toyota.com/three-two-one-toyota-debuts-amazing-all-new-rav4/">is redesigning and &#8220;electrifying&#8221; its Rav4 lineup</a> for 2026 with models that aren&#8217;t quite EVs, but could masquerade as one. The mega popular SUV will come standard with hybrid powertrains, including a plug-in version with a feature you&#8217;d expect in only pure EVs: fast charging.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">That&#8217;s right, the 2026 Rav4 PHEV can now plug into CCS-compatible DC fast chargers, which means owners can quickly fill up its battery during long road trips &#8212; effectively playing imposter amongst all the EVs charging up at rest stops as it secretly conserves its gas tank. Rest stops often lack standard AC level 2 plugs that many plug-in hybrids rely on &#8212; the kind you&#8217;d have installed at home so you can wake up to a full charge every morning.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The new Rav4&#8217;s on-board AC charger can also charge faster now at 11 kW, an upgrade from the previous 6.6kW. It also features a 6th-generation plug-in powertrain with AWD and up to 320 horsepower output. On a single charge, it can travel up to 50 miles without kicking on the engine &#8212; up from 42 miles on the 2025 version, and <a href="/2024/9/26/24254955/toyota-prius-rav4-plug-in-hybrid-drops-prime-2025">higher than the Prius&#8217; 44 miles</a>. Toyota doesn&#8217;t say how large the battery is but covers it under warranty for 10 years or 150,000 miles, whichever comes first.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Meanwhile the regular Rav4 hybrid runs on a 5th-gen system with a max output of 236 horsepower for the AWD version. The interiors now also come standard with larger 12.3-inch digital cluster panels and 10.5-inch infotainment touchscreens. And the Limited, XSE, and the all-new GR-Sport models come with a bigger 12.9-inch center touchscreen.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The hybridization of the Rav4 comes after Toyota decided to <a href="https://pressroom.toyota.com/toyota-camry-goes-exclusively-hybrid-plus-a-new-look-and-more-technology/">switch its Camry sedan</a> to an all-hybrid lineup last year. Toyota has doubled down on building more hybrid options instead of full EVs, although it has recently <a href="/news/665241/toyota-bz4x-bz-update-range-battery-design">improved its only full electric</a> that is now known as the bZ. Toyota says it will reveal pricing for the new Rav4 when it goes on sale later this year.</p></div>
