<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In The Andromeda Strain, Michael Crichton wrote about killer alien space crystals that are (spoiler alert) ultimately stymied by Earth&#8217;s breadth of pH values. In reality, crystals grown in space could be key to a new generation of cancer-fighting treatments that save lives, not threaten them.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Colorado-based startup Sierra Space is nearly ready to launch its reusable space plane, <a href="https://www.sierraspace.com/dream-chaser-spaceplane/">Dream Chaser</a>. It&#8217;s set to carry into orbit a 3-D printed module designed by engineers at <a href="https://www.sierraspace.com/press-releases/sierra-space-to-advance-cancer-research-on-inaugural-dream-chaser-spaceplane-mission-to-the-international-space-station/">pharma giant Merck</a>. If the test goes well, and if Dream Chaser&#8217;s gentle reentry process keeps that sensitive cargo safe, this could be the start of something big &#8212; despite those crystals being microscopic.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">A brief history of space crystals</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Space crystals sound like something an astrology guru would hang over their bed to help them sleep, but there&#8217;s real science here. According to the <a href="https://issnationallab.org/iss360/microgravity-molecular-crystal-growth/">ISS National Lab</a>, crystals grown in space are simply better: &#8220;Scientists hypothesize that these observed benefits result from a slower, more uniform movement of molecules into a crystalline lattice in microgravity.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Research into monoclonal antibodies points towards crystallization as being key for developing more stable, subcutaneous delivery mechanisms. Theoretically, expensive chemotherapy sessions could be replaced by injections that a patient could self-administer at home. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s the stuff of science fiction &#8212; and in the case of The Andromeda Strain, it literally is &#8212; but the truth is actually closer to Back to the Future. Space crystal research actually began in the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/np-2015-08-027-jsc_macromolecular_crystals-iss-mini-book-102715-508c.pdf">early &#8216;80s</a>, first on one-off rocket flights and eventually on the Space Shuttle.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">Space crystal research actually began in the early &#8216;80s</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">There was much hope (and hype) about the tech back then, but it was ultimately stymied by two things. The first is cost. The Space Shuttle orbiter was to be America&#8217;s low-cost orbital research transporter, but that never panned out. NASA&#8217;s own per-mission costs pegged each flight at somewhere around <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20200001093">$1.5 billion</a>. That&#8217;s simply far too expensive, even in the pharma industry, where reporting quarterly profits often requires seven or more digits.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The rise of SpaceX and its competitors has brought those costs down substantially, lowering the cost of getting cargo into space to a relatively paltry $2,000 per kg. But that still leaves the other problem: shock. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you&#8217;re going all the way to orbit just to grow some ultrafine structures, you don&#8217;t want to rattle them to pieces on the way back down. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;It&#8217;s about a 20 mph car crash equivalent into the ground,&#8221; Dr. Tom Marshburn said of the experience of landing in a capsule like <a href="/2020/5/30/21269703/spacex-launch-crew-dragon-nasa-orbit-successful">Dragon</a>. He would know. Marshburn is chief astronaut at Sierra and the company&#8217;s VP of human factors engineering, but before that he was a NASA astronaut. He&#8217;s flown on the Shuttle, Soyuz, and Dragon.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Sierra and its reusable Dream Chaser aircraft stand poised to fix both problems, cost and shock, in one fell swoop.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Easy entry</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Those of us of a certain age will likely feel a sort of irrational affinity for Dream Chaser at first glance. Its black and white color scheme and simple, lifting body design give strong <a href="/2012/4/19/2961276/space-shuttle-discovery">Space Shuttle orbiter</a> vibes, but this is no retro design intended to earn throwback cred. Dream Chaser has some major advantages over Shuttle.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">For one thing, it&#8217;s much smaller, about one-quarter the length. It fits neatly inside a payload compartment of a <a href="/2024/1/8/24029705/nasa-peregrine-mission-one-moon-lander-vulcan-centaur-rocket-launch">ULA (United Launch Alliance) Vulcan</a> rocket, not requiring the messy combination of tanks, liquid and solid fuel boosters, and endless specialized hardware that stymied any hope the Space Shuttle had in being profitable.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It also doesn&#8217;t require a three-mile-long runway like the Shuttle. &#8220;It can do a precision landing anywhere a 737 can land,&#8221; Dr. Marshburn said. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">&#8221;It can do a precision landing anywhere a 737 can land.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The biggest change, though, is that it won&#8217;t fly with crew onboard. For now, at least. Dream Chaser was born out of the Commercial Crew Transportation Capabilities (CCtCap) contract, a competition that also included SpaceX&#8217;s Dragon capsule and Boeing&#8217;s Starliner capsule. NASA selected two winners, and Sierra Space was unlucky to place third.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">However, seeing the potential, NASA offered enough orbital cargo contracts to make a Dream Chaser reboot worthwhile. A subtly redesigned space plane will launch and land as planned, just minus the people. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Why did NASA want to keep Sierra Space in the loop? Dream Chaser&#8217;s design offers some real benefits, particularly as we potentially enter an age of space manufacturing. &#8220;A capsule like a Dragon, by the nature of the physics, of the shape of it, can bring down only half of what it takes up,&#8221; said Meagan Crawford, founder and managing partner at <a href="https://spacefund.com/">SpaceFund</a>, an early-stage venture capital investment fund with a focus on commercial space. &#8220;The space plane has the opposite physics, it can bring down twice as much as it takes up.&#8221; </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">An ideal orbital transport and manufacturing network, then, has a combination of the two.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Microgravity potential</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">That&#8217;s the potential. For now, the project with Merck is something of a proof of concept, a 3D-printed module containing a series of tubes, plungers, and capsules. Once it gets to the ISS, a willing astronaut will turn some valves in sequence, then the resulting concoction will be shuttled back to Earth for someone at Merck to examine.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">And they&#8217;ll be able to do so quickly. Dr. Marshburn said that traditional reentry capsules like Dragon or Soyuz often spend days bouncing on boats or trucks before their cargo can be retrieved. Dream Chaser was designed for cargo to be offloaded within an hour after its wheels stop rolling. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Merck module will test that quick retrieval, plus the soft landing, ensuring the potential for this sort of crystalline growth in space. And, though <a href="/2024/12/7/24314191/iss-end-2030-commercial-space-station-mars-moon">the ISS is itself set to be decommissioned by the end of the decade</a>, Sierra Space is positioning its own <a href="/2024/7/25/24206219/nasa-sierra-space-inflatable-fabric-space-station-burst-test-video">inflatable orbital modules</a> as a commercial alternative, free of the politics and oversight of the ISS.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Space Fund&#8217;s Crawford said that the economics are sound, and the proof is in the number of players trying to capitalize on the space plane market. Startups like Venus Aerospace, Radian Aerospace, Dawn Aerospace, and Virgin Galactic each have their own aircraft in development, with goals ranging from cargo to space tourism.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Space drug development has the potential to be hugely promising, but Sierra has a few other arrows in its quiver. It&#8217;s partnering with Honda to get a <a href="https://hondanews.com/en-US/honda-corporate/releases/release-2d1ffdda49e1e85c7b147dd5780039ae-honda-to-conduct-testing-with-sierra-space-and-tec-masters-on-the-international-space-station">next-gen fuel cell into space</a>, and those of you craving smaller and better processors could be in luck too. A startup called <a href="https://www.spaceforge.com/">Space Forge</a> plans to grow processor substrates in orbit, another area where gentle touchdowns are key. In shattering today&#8217;s mission cost barriers, Sierra Space might just blow through the semiconductor nanometer barrier, too.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Softer cargo</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">There&#8217;s hope for one more type of cargo to come out of these missions. For now, Dream Chaser is relegated to transport only cargo, but the <a href="/news/638289/nasa-boeing-starliner-flight-preparations-2026">stumbles of the Starliner program</a> could reopen the door to hauling humans.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;You see a winged body and of course, astronauts, especially test pilots, we want to be in that,&#8221; Dr. Marshburn said. &#8220;At any point, we&#8217;d be able to leverage the work that&#8217;s already been done to get that ready.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If that does come to pass, it&#8217;ll take some time. Tenacity, the first Dream Chaser, is going through <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2025/03/dream-chaser-pre-flight-milestones/">final checks at NASA</a>, waiting for its chance to head to the ISS sometime later this year. The second, Reverence, is currently under production.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In other words: Watch this space.</p></div>
