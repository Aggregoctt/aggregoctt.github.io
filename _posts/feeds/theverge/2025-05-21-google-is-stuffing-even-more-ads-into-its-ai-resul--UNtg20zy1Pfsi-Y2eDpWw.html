<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google&#8217;s AI search results are about to get even more ads. On May 21st, the company announced that it&#8217;s going to start testing ads in AI Mode, the new AI-powered search feature that just <a href="/google-io/670439/google-ai-mode-search-io-2025">rolled out to everyone in the US</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">AI Mode is the new tab in Google Search that opens an AI chatbot-like interface, where you can get a rundown of what you&#8217;re searching for, along with links to relevant websites. But these answers could soon have product recommendations and other ads.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As an example, Google says if a user asks AI Mode for tips on how to build a website, the feature will surface a step-by-step guide on how to get started. It might even show a &#8220;helpful ad&#8221; for a website builder, which will have a &#8220;sponsored&#8221; label on it. Google says it&#8217;s testing search and shopping ads in AI Mode for users on desktop and mobile.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The search giant is also <a href="/2024/10/3/24260637/googles-ai-overview-ads-launch">expanding its ads in AI Overviews</a> &#8212; the AI-generated summaries that appear at the top of some search results &#8212; from mobile to desktop devices. Now, if you&#8217;re searching for advice on how to bring small dogs on flights, you might see a &#8220;sponsored&#8221; list of small dog carriers and links to buy them beneath the AI Overview.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Ads in AI Overviews on desktop are rolling out to everyone in the US starting today. Google also plans to bring ads to English-language AI Overviews in &#8220;select countries&#8221; later this year.</p></div>
