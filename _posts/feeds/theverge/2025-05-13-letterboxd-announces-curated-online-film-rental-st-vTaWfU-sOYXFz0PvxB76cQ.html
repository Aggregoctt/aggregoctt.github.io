<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Letterboxd &#8211; a film tracker app and the only good social network &#8211; announced a Letterboxd Video Store at the Festival de Cannes on Tuesday. Unlike a traditional video-on-demand service, Letterboxd Video Store will offer &#8220;limited festival-style windows&#8221; when you can stream &#8220;festival favorites, underseen gems, global cinema, and emerging voices&#8221; in cinema. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The service is even exploring limited runs of films that haven&#8217;t yet scored widespread distribution, which would make your dream watchlist that more attainable.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">When does it launch? What are the first selections? Which territories will it be available in? Will it be that compromised by Trump&#8217;s <a href="/politics/664396/trump-tariffs-hollywood-foreign-films-excise-tax">wacky tariff ideas</a>? We do not yet know. But Letterboxd does promise that the selections will be curated by the Letterboxd team leveraging &#8220;behavioral insight&#8221; gathered from the 20 million users logging, reviewing, and discoursing on its service. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Given that Letterboxd&#8217;s film blog <a href="https://letterboxd.com/journal/">Journal</a> is good actually, I trust this combination of personal curation and &#8220;community enthusiasm.&#8221; It&#8217;s a welcome addition to the curated streaming service space where Criterion and Mubi live, for those of us with Netflix fatigue and a yet-undetermined amount of bucks to spare. </p></div>
