<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Smart home company SwitchBot has announced a new version of its retrofit <a href="/23393163/best-smart-door-lock">smart lock</a>, and this one you can unlock with your face. The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.switch-bot.com%2Fproducts%2Fswitchbot-lock-ultra" rel="sponsored">SwitchBot Lock Ultra ($159.99)</a> works with the new <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.switch-bot.com%2Fproducts%2Fswitchbot-keypad-vision" rel="sponsored">SwitchBot Keypad Vision</a> ($99.99), which uses 3D facial recognition technology to unlock your door. The company also launched the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.switch-bot.com%2Fproducts%2Fswitchbot-hub-3" rel="sponsored">SwitchBot Hub 3</a>, a smart home hub that was <a href="/news/630987/switchbot-hub-3-matter-csa-registration">first teased in March</a>. The new products are now <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.switch-bot.com%2F" rel="sponsored">available for preorder </a>and should ship in June.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">SwitchBot claims its lock is the first retrofit smart lock with 3D facial recognition. As a retrofit lock, it can be installed without replacing your existing lock. Instead, the Ultra attaches to the rear of your lock and controls it using a mechanical motor, leaving the front unchanged, so you can still use your keys. The Vision keypad is mounted outside of your door and connects to the lock via Bluetooth.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.switch-bot.com%2Fproducts%2Fswitchbot-lock-ultra" rel="sponsored">SwitchBot Lock Ultra Vision Combo costs $249.99</a> and includes the lock, vision keypad, and a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.switch-bot.com%2Fproducts%2Fswitchbot-hub-mini-matter-enabled%3Fcurrency%3DUSD%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26utm_campaign%3Dfreelisting%26tw_source%3Dgoogle%26tw_adid%3D%26tw_campaign%3D21065448959%26gad_source%3D1%26gad_campaignid%3D22125258413%26gbraid%3D0AAAAACOjMwzNTTgXqeRgZ06qtZcr-vwCg%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwlrvBBhDnARIsAHEQgOSdxUyDC431qw12oJsDDeY8HonvJcEIF8KYQniuOTvZJpkh9ukmzS0aAjm_EALw_wcB" rel="sponsored">SwitchBot Hub Mini</a> (a hub is required for controlling the lock outside of Bluetooth range). </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Unlike most retrofit locks, Switchbot&#8217;s Lock Ultra, and its predecessors <a href="/2024/3/7/24092325/switchbot-lock-pro-features-release-date-price-specs">Switchbot Lock Pro</a> and <a href="/23323597/switchbot-lock-review-smart-door-lock">Switchbot Lock</a>, are compatible with nearly all existing locks in Europe and America. In addition to facial recognition, when connected to the keypad, the lock can be controlled with a fingerprint, a keycode, and an NFC card. Without the keypad, it works with a traditional key, app control, and auto-unlocking using geofencing (which activates the lock when your smartphone arrives at your house). </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The company says the Ultra can get up to nine months of battery life on the included rechargeable battery and also has a backup battery that lasts for up to five years. It works over Bluetooth and requires one of Switchbot&#8217;s gateways to connect to Wi-Fi and integrate with smart home systems, including Apple Home (through <a href="/23568091/matter-compatible-devices-accessories-apple-amazon-google-samsung">Matter</a>), Amazon Alexa, and Google Home.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The lock can also work with the new SwitchBot Hub 3 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5QKQ6PV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">($119.99)</a>, the company&#8217;s latest smart home hub designed to control and integrate SwitchBot&#8217;s Bluetooth products. The Hub 3 can bridge up to 30 SwitchBot devices to Matter ecosystems such as Apple Home. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The new Hub is a complete revamp from the <a href="/2023/1/4/23530873/switchbot-hub-2-matter-support-price-launch-date-ces23">second-gen version</a>. Larger and with a sleek, all-black design, it comes with an integrated stand and features a display, a dial, and four customizable buttons.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The hub also functions as a temperature and humidity sensor, as well as a light and motion sensor. Its display can wake up on motion and show information such as indoor temperature and door lock/unlock status, and the buttons can control smart home scenes.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The dial can connect to compatible devices to control them, for example, adjust the brightness of lights, the volume on connected TVs, and the temperature of a thermostat. SwitchBot says the hub can control Matter devices that are integrated with Apple Home, and it will work with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.switch-bot.com%2Fpages%2Fhome-assistant" rel="sponsored">Home Assistant</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Hub is also an IR controller and can integrate with over 100,000 IR device codes.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The new products are now available to preorder from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.switch-bot.com%2Fproducts%2Fswitchbot-hub-3" rel="sponsored">SwitchBot&#8217;s website</a>, with shipping slated for June. </p></div>
