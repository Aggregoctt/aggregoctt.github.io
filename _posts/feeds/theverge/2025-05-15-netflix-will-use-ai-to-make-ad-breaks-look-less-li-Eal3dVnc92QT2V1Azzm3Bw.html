<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Netflix is <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-upfront-2025-the-center-of-attention">working on a new type of ad</a> that will use AI to let advertisers &#8220;marry&#8221; their product with the streaming service&#8217;s shows and movies. This may sound like <a href="/news/667562/wbd-storyverse-the-matrix-friends-harry-potter">Warner Bros. Discovery&#8217;s plan to turn its IP</a> into commercials, but during Netflix&#8217;s Upfront event on Wednesday, the company demonstrated an example that placed the image of a product over a background inspired by one of its shows, like Stranger Things.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you&#8217;re on Netflix&#8217;s ad-supported plan, that means you might see an ad that blends in with the show you&#8217;re watching, whether it&#8217;s Bridgerton or Wednesday. Netflix says advertisers can insert this new ad format in the middle of what you&#8217;re watching, or put them on the screen when you hit pause. They could contain an overlay or call to action when they roll out by the end of this year.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s not clear how Netflix plans to evolve these ads down the road, but its advertising president Amy Reinhard said the pace of progress &#8220;is going to be even faster.&#8221; During the event, Netflix also announced that its <a href="/news/667042/netflix-ad-supported-tier-94-million-users-upfront-2025">ad-supported tier reached 94 million monthly users</a>, more than <a href="/2024/5/15/24157487/netflixs-ad-tier-40-million-subscribers">doubling the 40 million</a> it had at the same time last year.</p></div>
