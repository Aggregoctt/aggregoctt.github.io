title: I used two GPS hiking apps for backpacking and Iâ€™ll do it again

<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy2 _17nnmdy0 _17nnmdy7 _17nnmdy5 _1xwtict1 _17nnmdyb">For most of my life, I&#8217;ve relied on a paper map when I go outdoors. Then, in March, I joined <a href="https://www.todayontrail.com/">my friend Rusty</a> on the Appalachian Trail for two weeks. He told me to download FarOut.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">FarOut was my introduction to the world of app-based navigation. It&#8217;s focused on thru-hikers, and has useful details, including comments that tell you whether a specific water source is flowing, and if so, how well. It took me a minute to get the hang of it &#8212; I was hiking southbound, and it defaults to northbound &#8212; but once I did, I was impressed.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">FarOut works like a guidebook. But the kind of backpacking I ordinarily do is on more offbeat trails in the local national forests &#8212; not the wilderness highways FarOut specializes in. So for my first solo trip, to the Ventana Wilderness area of the Los Padres National Forest, I thought I&#8217;d try out some of the other navigation apps, as part of an absolutely transparent ploy to get my job to let me fuck off outdoors more often; there are a lot of hikes I want to do. I suspect many of our readers are connoisseurs of the great indoors, but I also know you love gadgets, and let me tell you something: so do backpackers. You would not believe the conversations I have had with absolute strangers about gear.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">I do work at the phones website. We kind of specialize in having feelings about apps</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Now, I&#8217;m not going to top <a href="https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/">Outdoor Gear Lab</a> &#8212; I love their reviews, and have found them reliable guides when it comes to big purchases<a href="#footnote">*</a> &#8212; but I do work at the phones website. We kind of specialize in having feelings about apps.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I considered several options. I quickly discarded onX Backcountry when I discovered on one of my trial hikes how quickly it drained my phone battery. I also used CalTopo to prepare for the hike, but because it&#8217;s a fairly complex platform with a steep learning curve, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve spent enough time with it to give it a proper review.I figured I might as well keep it simple. I already knew Google Maps wouldn&#8217;t cut it; the acquisitions Google has made over the years suggest that the company&#8217;s more interested in cars than pedestrians. Looking at the Health and Fitness category on the Apple App Store, I noticed AllTrails ranked #10, so trying the popular app seemed natural. The other app I saw frequently mentioned on hiking subreddits &#8212; besides CalTopo &#8212; was Gaia GPS. So I figured I&#8217;d start with those two.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">There are a few other apps in the space I didn&#8217;t consider. The most notable are Avenza and Goat Maps. I&#8217;ve found Avenza limited, but it seems the feature set has been updated since the last time I played with it. Goat Maps is new to me, but it&#8217;s from the same team that created Gaia GPS before it was sold to Outside. (More about that in a minute.)</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Route planning</strong></h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Because this was my first solo hike, I was not interested in doing anything especially difficult. I&#8217;ve been to the Ventana Wilderness before, and am familiar with the Pine Ridge Trail, which I viewed as the backbone of my trip. One of the things AllTrails has going for it is suggested routes &#8212; for this area, <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/parks/us/california/ventana-wilderness">41 possible hikes</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I had originally contemplated doing an overnight at China Camp before heading down the Pine Ridge Trail to Sykes Camp as an out-and-back, but after hiking with Rusty, I decided I could be more ambitious. I considered a few routes before settling on what AllTrails calls the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/big-sur-sykes-hot-springs-extended-loop">Big Sur Sykes Hot Springs Extended Loop</a>. That was partly because I&#8217;d checked in with the <a href="https://bigsurtrailmap.net/trailconditions.html">Big Sur Trail Map</a>, a volunteer information repository hosted by Jack Glendening for trail conditions, and discovered a few trails I might have otherwise wanted to use were overgrown.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">Once I started mapping my route, I noticed some trouble</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">AllTrails has user comments, which can be useful. One user told me to prepare for ticks and poison oak. Another suggested a stop at Timber Top for a meal or snack as it was beautiful, even if it was a detour, so I worked that into my agenda.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In order to get a sense of what I&#8217;d be doing, I used tools to create my routes, with different lines for each day. CalTopo, AllTrails, and Gaia all have &#8220;snap to route&#8221; tools that let you automatically follow a trail the map knows about, which makes creating a route easier. But once I started mapping my route, I noticed some trouble. AllTrails said this was a 32.8-mile hike. I had trouble getting Gaia to acknowledge the fire road that would be part of my route with its auto-route tool set; also, the app insisted I was hiking 40 miles. Both the AllTrails and Gaia &#8220;snap to route&#8221; tools were easier to use than CalTopo, and it came up with a totally different mileage count than either: a 35-mile hike.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Similarly, looking at elevation gain, AllTrails told me to expect 9,160 feet, CalTopo told me to expect 8901 feet, and Gaia, for some reason, was insisting on 19,000 feet. I gotta say, 19,000 feet did not seem like it was in the vicinity of right. Looking at the map I created on Gaia, I think that&#8217;s because the &#8220;snap to route&#8221; tool had given me some weird detours.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Well, what&#8217;s a couple miles and a few hundred feet of elevation between friends? I decided the smartest move would be to plan a four-day hike with three overnight stops: Sykes Camp, Rainbow Camp, and Outlaw Camp. I figured having more stops meant I could more easily absorb some unexpected miles if I had to.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">AllTrails&#8217; route-building tool was easiest to use, and the easiest to edit if I made a mistake. While I appreciated Gaia&#8217;s similarly easy snap-to-trail function, it was a profound pain in the ass to edit after I&#8217;d made a route. And CalTopo was the most finicky for route-building of the bunch, requiring painstaking clicking. But it also had the best feature set, in terms of lines, colors, and editing. It also had more base layers and overlays showing, among other things, where to expect cellphone service.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">CalTopo and Gaia let you build and edit maps on a phone, but I primarily used my laptop because a big screen is better for planning routes, and a mouse is a more precise tool than my finger. Tinkering with Gaia on my phone, I found route creation buggy.<a href="https://support.alltrails.com/hc/en-us/articles/37270479773204-Creating-custom-routes"> AllTrails doesn&#8217;t seem to offer route creation on the iPhone at all.</a> This didn&#8217;t matter much for me, but if you&#8217;re creating routes on the fly in the backcountry, you&#8217;re out of luck with AllTrails, and Gaia may suddenly quit working.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Why use apps at all?</strong></h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I harbor a deep and profound pro-paper bias. A notebook is the best organizational tool available to you. I own hundreds of paper books because they don&#8217;t have DRM and they can&#8217;t be altered post-publication, or removed from my devices. I like paper maps a great deal, and have used them as my main navigation tool for my entire hiking career.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Paper maps have downsides. They don&#8217;t respond well to water, for instance. Wear and tear can render them unusable. They may be out of date. And, of course, there are no crowdsourced comments telling you about trail conditions before your hike.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">The obvious benefit of the navigation apps is the reassuring little blue dot</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The obvious benefit of the navigation apps is the reassuring little blue dot that tells you exactly where you are on the trail, without requiring nearly as much work. You can pull out your phone and see how much farther you need to go before arriving at a landmark. And most of us have our phones on our hikes because they&#8217;re the most convenient way to take photos. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Gaia and AllTrails offer downloadable maps as part of a premium service &#8212; for a subscription fee, of course. That&#8217;s either $59.90 for Gaia or $89.99 for Gaia&#8217;s Outside Plus, which includes access to Outside&#8217;s assorted publications. The AllTrails Plus subscription I tested was $35.99 a year; after I went on my hike, it announced AllTrails Peak, which costs $79.99 a year and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/12/alltrails-debuts-a-80-year-membership-that-includes-ai-powered-smart-routes/">includes AI tools for route planning</a>. (<a href="/2024/12/5/24313222/chatgpt-pardon-biden-bush-esquire">Given what I know about LLMs</a>, I personally would not trust an AI to plan any hiking route, but I suppose your mileage may vary.) CalTopo, which offers its own set of subscription plans at $20, $50, and $100 a year, shows weather data and information about how much sunlight any part of its map gets at any hour of the day.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">There are a couple downsides to these apps. They drain the phone battery, which necessitates carrying a portable charger, which means more weight. If the phone doesn&#8217;t work &#8212; because, say, you dropped it &#8212; the app won&#8217;t work either. And there are, of course, the privacy issues.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">I don&#8217;t want people to know where I am at all times</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">My location is sensitive information; I don&#8217;t want people to know where I am at all times. AllTrails defaults to sharing your data publicly, so anyone on Earth can look up your hikes. While you can change this setting, defaults matter. &#8220;Public trail activities and community reviews are a big part of the AllTrails experience,&#8221; spokesperson Mia DeSimone in an email. I was also prompted to review my hike afterwards &#8212; part of the crowdsourced data that makes AllTrails work, I suppose.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">AllTrails also shares your data. Some of that is unobjectionable &#8212; payment providers, for instance &#8212; but some of it, like sharing data with marketing partners, raised my eyebrows. &#8220;AllTrails does not process sensitive personal data, including precise geolocation, for purposes other than actual use of the AllTrails platform,&#8221; DeSimone said.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I can&#8217;t speak to the pluses and minuses of AllTrails Peak, which I haven&#8217;t experimented with. But after my hike, AllTrails also discontinued its &#8220;Advanced Conditions&#8221; feature that showed weather along a prospective route, what to expect from the ground (wet? icy?), and mosquito activity. AllTrails Peak users will get access to &#8220;Trail Conditions,&#8221; which DeSimone says is &#8220;significantly more robust and precise than Advanced Conditions.&#8221; Some AllTrails users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alltrails/comments/1kmn3hz/just_shocked_ok_not_really/">seem unhappy</a> about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alltrails/comments/1ko9l0r/support_trying_to_claim_that_the_heatmap_never/">the new pricing tier</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Gaia similarly defaults to public sharing, because of &#8220;a social component designed to help users connect, share experiences, and discover trails,&#8221; said Devin Lehman, general manager of Gaia GPS, in an emailed statement. &#8220;Public sharing of hikes is the default setting to encourage this community engagement.&#8221; Gaia also shares some data, including location data, with unnamed &#8220;service providers,&#8221; but Lehman said this is done &#8220;under strict data protection agreements&#8221; and is used to &#8220;support and power specific features and functionalities.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Last year, Gaia began requiring sign-ins, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GaiaGPS/comments/1fn55df/sign_in/">catching a few people</a> who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GaiaGPS/comments/1f8xsqp/outside_account/">were on multi-day trips</a> by surprise. &#8220;To ensure minimal disruption, we implemented a &#8216;snooze&#8217; option allowing users to defer login for up to 28 days if prompted during an active trip,&#8221; Lehman wrote. &#8220;Users entirely offline (airplane mode or zero cell service) would not see the prompt at all. However, we understand some users in areas with intermittent service did encounter unexpected prompts. We&#8217;ve taken user feedback seriously and continue refining our app experience to better support uninterrupted outdoor adventures.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Its parent company, Outside, also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GaiaGPS/comments/192ckde/the_huge_increase_we_knew_was_coming_with_outside/">jacked up the cost</a> of subscriptions, and on April 14th this year, it <a href="https://blog.gaiagps.com/a-fond-farewell-to-national-geographic-maps-and-a-look-at-whats-ahead/">removed access to the National Geographic Trails Illustrated maps</a>. &#8220;While we understand some subscribers valued the National Geographic Trails Illustrated maps, these maps offered limited regional coverage and lacked the global scope and dynamic functionality our growing user base needs,&#8221; Lehman wrote. He says Gaia &#8220;substantially expanded&#8221; its offerings in the last few years, and the price increase reflects &#8220;the ongoing investment required to maintain and continuously improve Gaia GPS.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Be that as it may, I&#8217;ve got several friends who are disgruntled Gaia subscribers looking around for another option. And I personally do not have faith in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-the-southwest/the-decline-of-outside-magazine-is-also-the-end-of-a-vision-of-the-mountain-west">Outside&#8217;s management</a> of Gaia, <a href="https://escapecollective.com/theres-a-wildfire-outside/">or its other properties</a>, in the long run.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>On the trail</strong></p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Because I was uncertain about my mileage, I decided to track myself several ways: AllTrails, Gaia, and my Apple Watch Series 6. The Apple Watch isn&#8217;t really an ideal fitness tracker for outdoors enthusiasts &#8212; it&#8217;s flimsy and its battery drains too fast; even the Ultra 2 only gives you 72 hours in low power mode. What it does have going for it is that I already own it, and there are other pieces of gear that were more important to upgrade after my experience on the AT. <a href="https://sectionhiker.com/lightweight-backpacking-what-the-big-4/">The Big Four</a> in pack weight are your tent, sleeping bag or quilt, sleeping pad, and pack itself. Updating my tent and quilt, both expensive, also meant I lost about 5 pounds of weight from my pack immediately. Since this wasn&#8217;t a long hike and I was already carrying a battery, the Apple Watch&#8217;s propensity to drain quickly, even with both low power mode and theater mode on, didn&#8217;t seem too terrible.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I set out from the trailhead Monday morning, and turned on tracking for AllTrails, Gaia, and my Apple Watch. As with all tracking, there are opportunities for user error &#8212; I am of course capable of forgetting to turn this stuff on, or pausing it and then never unpausing it. I mention this because there was user error: I paused the AllTrails tracker and then never unpaused it, so as far as it&#8217;s concerned, I hiked 3.7 miles that first day.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I was more successful with my watch and Gaia. I started my watch late &#8212; looking at the map, I seem to have missed at least a mile before I started it; it recorded 9 miles of walking. I did start Gaia at the beginning of my hike, and it recorded I hiked 11.6 miles. Both watch and app recorded about 2,400 feet of ascent, a little less than what CalTopo told me to expect (2,600 feet of elevation gain) and significantly less than what AllTrails told me to expect (3,000 feet).</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I arrived at Sykes Camp, alongside the Big Sur River, a little after 4PM, and set up my tent. It was close enough to dinnertime that I decided to eat. As I was hunched over the stove, a woman walked by, so I said hello. She was looking for the hot spring, and continued walking upriver. About 45 minutes later, she returned. She hadn&#8217;t found it.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The hot spring wasn&#8217;t listed on the AllTrails map, the CalTopo map, or either of my paper maps. But it was on Gaia, and after dinner, I found the hot spring, a half-mile hike on a somewhat overgrown path downriver, and soaked blissfully for about half an hour. I&#8217;d post a selfie, but this is the internet, and I know better than to post feet for free.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The next morning I packed up and headed off to Rainbow Camp around 8:45AM. This, I knew, would be an up-and-down day of ridgeline hiking; AllTrails had a helpful elevation map telling me roughly what to expect. Unlike Sykes, Rainbow Camp was likely to be a place I&#8217;d be alone. Most of the people I&#8217;d spoken to the day before were doing an out-and-back, with Sykes as their only stop. But this ridgeline hike was spotted with wildflowers.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I&#8217;d planned for this to be a fairly short day, only about 7 miles. I pulled into Rainbow Camp around 2PM and was underwhelmed &#8212; it was buggy and not especially scenic. So after eating lunch and refreshing my water supply, I decided to push on to Cold Spring Camp. The AllTrails map suggested it would only be 5 miles more. It was uphill, though, about 2,000 more feet of climbing. Even if I dragged along at 1 mile an hour, I&#8217;d still arrive before sunset.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I&#8217;d thought about camping at Cold Spring before I set off, and had shied away from it both because of the climb and my uncertainty about the actual mileage of my hike. But I was feeling good, and I&#8217;d used my Garmin InReach Mini to check in about my change of plans, so I shoved off.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">According to my trackers recording my actual route &#8212; Gaia and AllTrails &#8212; it was more like 6 miles, not 5. Gaia tracked 4,884 feet of climb over a total distance of 13.6 miles; AllTrails suggested I&#8217;d climbed 5,213 feet over 14.6 miles. (Did I miss a mile somewhere on Gaia? I don&#8217;t see a gap in the recording, so I&#8217;m not sure how to account for the difference.) My Apple Watch said I&#8217;d gone 11.5 miles, also with 4,884 feet of climb &#8212; but its battery died before I made camp. I set up camp at Cold Spring, and watched the sun go down over the ocean as I ate dinner.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The extra mileage meant I could plausibly make it home the following day. Sure, there were several camps available if I was too tired to do the rest of the hike, but depending on which tracker I used as my source of truth, I had somewhere between 11 and 13 miles left, a fairly easy day of hiking, particularly since it would all be downhill. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The third day opened with ridgeline views; I was above a thick ceiling of clouds hiding the ocean. There were, of course, more wildflowers. When I turned off the dirt road onto Terrace Creek Trail, I met a day hiker going the other direction, who warned me about ticks on the grassy descent toward a redwood grove. (Maybe because he went through just before me, or maybe because of the permethrin I&#8217;d used on my clothes, I didn&#8217;t see any.) </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I made it back to the parking lot a little after 4PM. I&#8217;d had some user error with my Apple Watch &#8212; forgetting to start it again after breakfast at Timber Top, so there was an hour and a half gap in its data &#8212; and it recorded 11 miles. AllTrails crapped out at some point between when I set off from Cold Spring and breakfast, so it didn&#8217;t record my entire hike. Still, it got 11.63 miles. Gaia also had a gap in its recording (something wrong with my phone?) and put me at 12.7 miles.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I thought the hike would settle how long the route was. It did, in a way &#8212; certainly the hike was longer than the 32.8 miles AllTrails had promised. If we take Gaia&#8217;s tracking, which was the most complete of the bunch, as the source of truth, I&#8217;d hiked 38 miles, 39 if I added the hike to the hot spring. </p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Conclusion&#8230; of some sort</strong></h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">While I had my paper maps (and compass) with me, the point was to test the apps, and they worked well enough that I didn&#8217;t have to refer to my &#8220;real&#8221; maps at all. But I also didn&#8217;t come away with a single clear winner, whether AllTrails or Gaia was best. AllTrails offered better route-planning features, while Gaia was more reliable on the trail. Both had worrisome inaccuracies in their data, which meant in practical terms that I lugged around another day of food in extra weight because I wasn&#8217;t totally sure how far I&#8217;d be climbing or walking. That&#8217;s consequential &#8212; food and water are usually the heaviest things a hiker carries.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I certainly wouldn&#8217;t recommend relying on either of these, particularly without a backup map, and I&#8217;m not sold on how they handle my privacy. AllTrails seems to be aimed at people who are more casual hikers than I am. I don&#8217;t think Outside has been a good steward of Gaia (or <a href="https://www.cjr.org/news/outside-magazine-thurston-contributors-revolt.php">of Outside Magazine</a>). I also hesitate to recommend pricey subscriptions to these apps, given the issues I had with them. In fact, as I was writing this, I realized the most useful app in planning the trip was the one I hadn&#8217;t downloaded maps from: CalTopo.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _17nnmdya _1xwtict1">I haven&#8217;t tested CalTopo in the backcountry yet, so consider this a cliffhanger. Please feel free to pop over to the comments to demand I be allowed to go backpacking for work sooner rather than later, so you can hear more about my map-related misadventures. I&#8217;ve been eyeing the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/wildflowers/regions/Pacific_Southwest/TahoeRimTrail/index.shtml">Tahoe Rim Trail</a> for later this summer, and if I&#8217;m testing gear, it doesn&#8217;t count as vacation time, right? Right?</p>
<p> * Except in the case of bras. <a href="https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/topics/clothing-womens/best-sports-bra">Outdoor Gear Lab&#8217;s top bra recommendation&#8217;s</a> largest size is a C cup, and the reviews are written primarily for teeny tatas. That&#8217;s an astounding editorial failure. Not only do athletes of big titty experience have a harder time finding bras at all, we are more likely to experience boob pain &#8212; which <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/10/29/9631102/sports-bra-research">is a major reason women quit sports</a>. Breast tissue is dead weight, so bra structure is crucial. A bra that&#8217;s stretchy enough to fit over your head won&#8217;t keep the girls in place during high-impact exercise. Some other rules of thumb: racerbacks press on your traps; thin straps cut into your shoulders; a thick, tight band is a must for weight distribution. A low-cut bra means an astonishing amount of cleavage, but <a href="https://blog.petitedressing.com/donts-big-bust/">a high neckline</a> will make your gazongas look even bigger, so pick your poison, I guess. (Also, a high-cut bra worn for a long time will incubate a real banner crop of cleavage zits and, in some cases, chafing.)<br><br>For running, I like <a href="https://enell.com/products/enell-sport">Enell&#8217;s High Impact Bra</a> &#8212; it&#8217;s the only one I&#8217;ve tried that&#8217;s kept my rack from bouncing. (It&#8217;s <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/best-sports-bra-large-breasts-high-impact/">also recommended</a> by <a href="https://www.shesabeast.co/">Swole Woman Casey Johnston</a>.) I&#8217;m still on the lookout for the best backpacking bra; the Enell one is too binding for all-day wear.</p>
