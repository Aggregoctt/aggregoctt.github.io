<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Memorial Day marks the unofficial start of summer, and if you somehow managed to skip your spring cleaning earlier this year, the turning of the season offers a fresh chance to declutter your space. Thankfully, the <strong><a href="/2023/9/14/23872638/twelve-south-hirise-3-deluxe-iphone-charging-stand">Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe</a></strong> offers a stylish way to organize your desk or bedside table, and it&#8217;s currently available for a new low of $79.99 ($20 off) from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twelve-South-Compact-MagSafe-Charging/dp/B0CV4WNKHT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Fhirise-3-deluxe%2F" rel="sponsored">Twelve South</a>.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Twelve-South-Compact-MagSafe-Charging/dp/B0CV4WNKHT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 80</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 150</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">47 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 80</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">Twelve South&#8217;s 3-in-1 charging stand offers full 15W MagSafe iPhone charging and can simultaneously top up a set of AirPods while fast-charging a compatible Apple Watch. The charger includes a power supply (with travel adapters) to deliver enough juice over its five-foot / 1.5m USB cable.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Twelve South&#8217;s sturdy HiRise 3 Deluxe is a great 3-in-1 charging stand for a number of reasons. Not only can it deliver up to 15W of power to MagSafe-compatible iPhones, but it&#8217;s also capable of fast-charging an Apple Watch Series 7 and newer models. It includes a 7.5W wireless charging pad as well, which you can use to top off a pair of AirPods or any other Qi-compatible device you might have on hand, including a second phone, a Samsung Galaxy Watch, or other electronics.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">What truly sets it apart from a lot of other 3-in-1 chargers, though, is its design; instead of placing the charging pads side-by-side, Twelve South has arranged them in a front-to-back layout to reduce desk clutter. Plus, thanks to the charger&#8217;s support for <a href="/23791165/apple-ios-17-standby-iphone-dock">StandBy mode</a> &#8212; an ultra-handy feature Apple first introduced in iOS 17 &#8212; you can also use your phone as a mini smart display when you place it horizontally on the adjustable charging pad, allowing you to quickly check the time, view your daily schedule, and take advantage of useful widgets with ease.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">More Memorial Day savings</h2><ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1ymtmqpi _11h7yix0 _1xwtict1"><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The <a href="/news/645745/sony-adds-three-new-wireless-speakers-to-bass-boosted-ult-power-sound-lineup"><strong>Sony ULT Field 3</strong></a> is available at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Dustproof-Shockproof/dp/B0DYB6KMJH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-SRSULT30B-Wireless-Speaker%2F13975352006%2F" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> for $148 ($52 off), which is its best price to date.
