<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft has been quietly killing off a number of Surface devices over the past few years. At first it was the Surface Headphones and Surface Earbuds <a href="/2022/10/14/23400839/microsoft-surface-headphones-3-no-new-model-2-features">that started to disappear</a>, then came news of a <a href="/2023/1/18/23560771/microsoft-hardware-changes-layoffs-2023">changed &#8220;hardware portfolio&#8221;</a> amid 10,000 job cuts at Microsoft in early 2023. A year later, Microsoft then <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/phones/the-surface-duo-is-dead-microsoft-pulls-plug-on-usd1-500-surface-duo-2-after-just-one-android-os-upgrade">killed off</a> the Surface Duo and <a href="/2024/12/6/24314732/microsoft-surface-studio-2-plus-end-of-production">ended production</a> of its innovative Surface Studio 2 all-in-one PC. Now, I&#8217;m hearing that another Surface device is on the way out.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Sources familiar with Microsoft&#8217;s Surface plans tell me that the company stopped production of its Surface Laptop Studio 2 earlier this month. No more units are being produced, and Microsoft is planning to mark the device as end of life in June. I asked Microsoft to comment on the end of life for the Surface Laptop Studio 2, but the company declined to provide a statement.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft&#8217;s official Surface resellers, however, were happy to discuss the future of Microsoft&#8217;s folding laptop. &#8220;Surface Laptop Studio 2 has reached end of manufacturing and availability of supply will be limited and may vary by market going forward,&#8221; confirmed one reseller when I queried about a lack of stock. &#8220;Microsoft will continue to support Surface Laptop Studio 2 through driver and firmware updates in accordance with the Surface Driver and Firmware Lifecycle.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Much like how the Surface Studio reached end of life, there doesn&#8217;t appear to be a Surface Laptop Studio 3 on the horizon. That&#8217;s a shame because ever since Microsoft hit the Surface 10-year mark in 2022, <a href="/23422520/microsoft-surface-10-years-history">I&#8217;ve been wondering</a> whether the company will continue to innovate in the decade ahead and push PC makers to invest in laptop and tablet designs.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Over the past few years, the future direction of Surface hardware hasn&#8217;t been totally clear, especially after former Surface chief <strong>Panos Panay</strong> <a href="/2023/9/18/23878759/microsoft-windows-panos-panay-surface-yusuf-mehdi">departed for Amazon in 2023</a>. Now, it increasingly looks like the future of Surface is all about the simplification of existing product lines.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The two new Surface devices that go on sale next week &#8212; the Surface Laptop 13-inch and Surface Pro 12-inch &#8212; are just smaller versions of what exists today. Microsoft isn&#8217;t experimenting with a whacky new form factor here or trying to push Surface in a radical new direction. These devices are safe bets, while acknowledging <a href="/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/661617/microsoft-surface-hardware-engineering-labs-tour-notepad">the effort required to develop them</a>. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">These two devices are symbolic of the future direction for Surface, and I&#8217;d be amazed if Microsoft suddenly surprises everyone with something like a dual-screen Surface Duo or an all-in-one Surface Studio anytime soon. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">This simplification is evident if you visit Microsoft&#8217;s Surface website, where the only two choices of devices you&#8217;re presented with are the Surface Pro and Surface Laptop. If you dig a little deeper, you&#8217;ll still find the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/business/surface-go-4#Areaheading-power">Surface Go 4 on sale</a> for businesses, nearly two years after it was first <a href="/2023/9/21/23880536/microsoft-surface-go-4-convertible-price-release-date">announced alongside</a> the Surface Laptop Studio 2.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I understand the Surface Go 4 is still being produced and stock levels are healthy at resellers. We may even eventually see a new Arm-powered Surface Go device in the future, particularly because it&#8217;s a popular device thanks to the smaller form factor and pricing.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Surface Go 4 was originally supposed to ship with an Arm-powered Qualcomm processor according to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/surface/microsoft-is-working-on-an-arm-powered-surface-go-and-11-inch-surface-pro">Windows Central</a>, before Microsoft landed on a traditional Intel chip instead. Any early signs of a Surface Go 4 successor may now come from Qualcomm. Microsoft has been following Qualcomm&#8217;s chip roadmap with its latest Surface devices, introducing its Copilot Plus PC initiative alongside the launch of the Snapdragon X Elite last year, and then making Windows laptops cheaper after the debut of the eight-core Snapdragon X Plus launched at CES earlier this year.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Qualcomm typically hosts its Snapdragon summit in the fall, and I&#8217;m curious to see if the chipmaker has another Snapdragon X series variant for a Surface Go 5. Qualcomm <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/qualcomm-teases-snapdragon-x-processors-for-600-laptops-possibly-a-6-core-variant#:~:text=Even%20cheaper%20Snapdragon%20laptops%20incoming&amp;text=The%20company%20hasn%E2%80%99t%20said,thanks%20to%20Microsoft%20Windows%20support.&amp;text=teaser%2C%20Source:%20XDA-,What%20is%20this?,is%20just%206%20weeks%20away.&amp;text=X%20Plus%20X1P%2D??">originally teased</a> an entry-level chip for entry-level laptops last year, which looked like it might have six cores, but it went on to only launch its <a href="/2025/1/6/24334870/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-laptops-mini-pcs-ces-2025">mid-level 8-core Snapdragon X Plus</a> in January.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Beyond the simplification of its Surface lineup, we might well see Microsoft experiment further with devices for AI assistants in the future, much like how it tried to make dedicated Cortana hardware in the past. Surface and Windows chief <strong>Pavan Davuluri</strong> hinted at that <a href="/2024/10/3/24261161/microsoft-copilot-future-hardware-ai-notepad">when I spoke to him in October</a>. &#8220;The big difference now for us vs. the past is the agent experience itself is complete enough, meaningful enough, that it gives us permission to look at other form factors and devices,&#8221; Davuluri said. &#8220;I think it will free up the ability to innovate in hardware and come out with purpose-built hardware.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft has already started using the <a href="/news/667167/windows-hey-copilot-ai-wake-word-voice-activation">&#8220;Hey, Copilot!&#8221; wake word</a> to activate Copilot Voice in Windows 11, which reminds me a lot of &#8220;Hey, Cortana!&#8221; in Windows 10. I&#8217;m not so sure that Microsoft is ready to compete with Alexa again, but Copilot is already a far better digital assistant than Cortana ever was, even if everyone uses ChatGPT instead.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I&#8217;m just hoping that Microsoft&#8217;s fascination with AI will still mean there is room for Surface experimentation in the future. <a href="/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/661617/microsoft-surface-hardware-engineering-labs-tour-notepad">Like I said last week</a>, Surface has become known for pushing the boundaries of Windows laptops, not just smaller iterative designs. <a href="/2015/10/8/9479443/everyone-is-copying-microsofts-surface">Everyone copied the Surface Pro</a>, including Apple, but it increasingly looks like it&#8217;s <a href="/2025/1/7/24337633/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-laptop-flexible-oled-price-specs">Lenovo that&#8217;s willing to experiment</a> more than Microsoft these days. It&#8217;s not a great sign that the Surface Studio and Surface Laptop Studio are seemingly gone, but perhaps &#8212; just like the Surface Book &#8212; they will pave the way for what&#8217;s next.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The pad:</h2><ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1ymtmqpi _11h7yix0 _1xwtict1"><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Microsoft is laying off more than 6,000 employees. </strong>Around 3 percent of Microsoft&#8217;s entire workforce is being <a href="/news/659401/microsoft-layoffs-three-percent-workforce">laid off this week</a>, the biggest job cuts at Microsoft since it laid off 10,000 employees in 2023. The cuts have impacted all different roles at Microsoft, with 1,985 employees losing their jobs in Redmond alone (1,510 in office and 475 remote). Most of the job losses in Redmond have been software engineering roles, which comes at a time when Microsoft and others are investing in AI and keep discussing the potential for it to replace human engineers.</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Microsoft starts testing &#8216;Hey, Copilot!&#8217; in Windows. </strong>If you&#8217;re a Windows 11 beta tester, you can now try out hands-free access to Microsoft&#8217;s AI app. <a href="/news/667167/windows-hey-copilot-ai-wake-word-voice-activation">Copilot Voice can now be activated</a> with &#8220;Hey, Copilot!&#8221; in Windows 11 test builds, much like how &#8220;Hey, Cortana!&#8221; worked on Windows 10 before Microsoft killed off its previous digital assistant.</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Microsoft extends Office app support on Windows 10 to 2028. </strong>Microsoft revealed earlier this year that it was planning to stop supporting Office apps (Microsoft 365) on Windows 10 after the October 14th end of support cutoff, but it&#8217;s now making a U-turn. Microsoft is pledging to <a href="/news/665599/microsoft-365-office-apps-windows-10-end-of-support-extension-2028">continue providing security updates for Office apps on Windows 10 for an additional three years</a>. It&#8217;s all part of helping businesses transition to Windows 11, apparently. Given how popular Windows 10 still is, I&#8217;m still not fully convinced that the Windows 10 end of life will actually happen in October, though.</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Microsoft reveals its rejected Start menu redesigns. </strong>Microsoft is redesigning the Windows 11 Start menu this month with a new, wider design that finally lets you disable the recommended feed of files and apps. The final design could have looked a lot different though, as <a href="/news/665566/microsoft-new-start-menu-windows-11-redesign-concepts">Microsoft has revealed a bunch of concept images</a> that could have radically overhauled how the Start menu functions in Windows. One Start menu concept even takes up the entire vertical space of a screen, complete with separated sections that you seem to scroll vertically to access.</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Microsoft quietly bumps Surface Pro 11 and Surface Laptop 7 price by $200</strong>. The entry-level Surface Pro 11 and Surface Laptop 7 were a great value at $999, but Microsoft has <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/surface/surface-pro-11-laptop-7-price-bump-1200-dollars">quietly stopped selling them</a> at its own online store after announcing the smaller Surface Laptop and Surface Pro.
