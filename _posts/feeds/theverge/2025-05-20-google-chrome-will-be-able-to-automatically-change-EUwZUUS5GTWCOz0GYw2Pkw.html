So we see automatic password change as a win for safety, as well as usability. Overall, that&#8217;s a win-win for users.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I asked if Chrome might automatically change passwords on a regular basis so they&#8217;re never outdated, but Tabriz says that Chrome won&#8217;t change a bad or compromised password without user consent. &#8220;We&#8217;re very much focused on keeping the user in control of changing their password.&#8221; </p></div>
