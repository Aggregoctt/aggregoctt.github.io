<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Nintendo&#8217;s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftech-specs%2F" rel="sponsored">Switch 2 specs page</a> is light on details. However, Digital Foundry has shared what it says are &#8220;rock solid&#8221; specifications for the upcoming console in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-final-tech-specs-and-system-reservations-confirmed">an article</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huxDoYXS8Ng">a video</a>, offering new information about its processor and a testing tool for developers for GameChat.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">On its specs page, Nintendo only describes the Switch 2&#8217;s chip as a &#8220;custom processor made by Nvidia.&#8221; Nvidia shared <a href="/news/642793/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-support-nvidia-ray-tracing">a bit more last month</a>, including that its chip enables DLSS and real-time ray tracing on the Switch 2. Digital Foundry gets more specific: it says the Switch 2&#8217;s custom Nvidia T239 system-on-a-chip uses an ARM Cortex A78C CPU with eight cores. Six cores will be available to developers, while two will be used for the system.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The GPU uses Nvidia&#8217;s Ampere architecture. The console also has 12GB of LPDDR5X memory, though the system will hold 3GB in reserve.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As for the Switch 2&#8217;s display capabilities, while VRR is supported on the console&#8217;s screen, the device doesn&#8217;t support VRR while in docked mode and connected to HDMI, Digital Foundry reports. Nintendo originally advertised that VRR would be available while docked as well, but it&#8217;s since <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-scrubs-mentions-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-supporting-vrr-on-a-tv-while-docked.1166361/">scrubbed mentions of that</a> on its website. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Digital Foundry also notes an interesting tidbit about GameChat, the new Discord-like chat system for the Switch 2. Nintendo is offering developers a GameChat testing tool that &#8220;simulates API latency and L3 cache misses that the real world GameChat system incurs on the system, meaning developers can test this without needing active GameChat sessions running,&#8221; Digital Foundry says. Hopefully, this testing tool will help developers make sure that GameChat doesn&#8217;t bog down their games.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Digital Foundry has a lot more detail than I covered here, so check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-final-tech-specs-and-system-reservations-confirmed">its</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huxDoYXS8Ng">coverage</a> of the specs to learn more.
