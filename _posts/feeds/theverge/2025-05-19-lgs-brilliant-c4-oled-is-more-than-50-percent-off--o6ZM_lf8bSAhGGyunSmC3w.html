<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Memorial Day marks the unofficial start of summer, but it&#8217;s also one of the best times of the year to snag a seriously good deal on a top-tier TV. Right now, for instance, you can buy <strong>LG&#8217;s C4 OLED</strong> at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-42-Inch-Processor-AI-Powered-OLED42C4PUA/dp/B0CVRXN6XZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-42-class-c4-series-oled-evo-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv%2F6578050.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled42c4pua-oled-4k-tv" rel="sponsored">LG&#8217;s online storefront</a> in the 42-inch configuration starting at an all-time low of around $796.99 ($703 off). Larger configurations are also on sale, including the 65-inch model, which is available for $1,296.99 ($1,403 off) from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-42-Inch-Processor-AI-Powered-OLED42C4PUA/dp/B0CVS18PH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-65-class-c4-series-oled-evo-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv-2024%2F6578042.p%3FskuId%3D6578042" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled65c4pua-oled-4k-tv" rel="sponsored">LG</a>. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Although it&#8217;s no longer LG&#8217;s latest OLED, the C4 remains an excellent investment. It shares many of the same strengths as its successor, <a href="/2025/1/5/24336168/lg-2025-oled-tv-m5-g5-c5-b5-features-specs">the C5</a>, including deep blacks, rich contrast, and vibrant, lifelike colors, with only a slight drop in brightness and processing speed. Plus, thanks to support for both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, the C4 delivers an immersive, cinematic experience right from your living room. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In addition to streaming, the C4 is also a fantastic gaming TV. It boasts a fast 144Hz refresh rate, four HDMI 2.1 ports, low input lag, and support for both AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync. Rounding out the package, the last-gen TV also works with the wand-like Magic Remote and integrates with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant for easy, nearly hands-free navigation, making it a highly capable pick for all your home theater and gaming needs.</p></div>
