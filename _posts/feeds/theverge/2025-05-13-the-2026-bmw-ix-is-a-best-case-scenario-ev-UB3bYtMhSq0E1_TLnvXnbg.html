<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">BMW has been on a roll lately, selling more EVs in North America than most of its competitors, including fellow luxury brands like Mercedes and Audi. But while most of the automaker&#8217;s lineup is soaring, its flagship iX SUV has been struggling to find an audience. BMW only sold 15,383 iX vehicles in 2024, down 11 percent year over year. Sales numbers ticked up slightly in the first quarter, but after <a href="/2020/11/11/21558833/bmw-ix-inext-electric-suv-range-price-specs">being on the market since 2022</a>, the iX is in need of an upgrade. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">With those struggles in mind, <a href="/news/601975/bmws-refreshed-ix-has-an-even-bigger-kidneys-than-before">BMW announced the refreshed 2026 iX earlier this year</a>, which takes a lot of <a href="/23074741/bmw-ix-xdrive50-review-ev-specs-price-photos">the best parts of the electric SUV</a> and dials them up a notch. The battery is slightly larger, the range is longer, the tech is flashier, the interior is more luxurious, and the kidney grille is even more in your face than ever before. This bucktoothed SUV is so happy to be getting a makeover that it&#8217;s positively grinning from ear to ear.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I got a chance to drive the updated iX &#8212; once on a media drive through upstate New York and then again over a weekend in suburban New Jersey &#8212; and it&#8217;s clear that it remains a near-perfect luxury EV with some noteworthy downsides. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">The battery is slightly larger, the range is longer, the tech is flashier</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">BMW has refined the driving experience with improved suspension and enhanced chassis control systems, which addresses some complaints about the stiffness of the iX&#8217;s drive quality. It broadened the model family to include a more affordable option and tweaked the design to give it a more aggressive and beguiling stance. The headlights are sleeker and better integrated into the front end. And the performance capabilities have been tuned up with more power and response. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But there are some tradeoffs. The operating system remains mostly cluttered and forgettable (most owners are likely to opt for phone projection). And there were some build quality issues that left me wondering how they got past quality control. But overall, the iX retains its status as the luxury EV that I end up recommending the most. </p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Spec bump</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The two existing variants of the iX are getting new names that befit their new power and range capabilities. And there&#8217;s an entry level model joining the family, as BMW seeks to make the iX accessible to a broader range of buyers.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The previous base model, the xDrive50, now becomes the xDrive60, with a slightly bigger battery (113 kWh gross over 111.5 kWh), more horsepower (536 hp, as compared to the xDrive50&#8217;s 516 hp), and more range (EPA-estimated 364 miles over the previous gen&#8217;s 304 miles). BMW is suggesting a starting price of $89,675 (including a $1,175 destination charge), as compared to the xDrive50&#8217;s starting price of $88,425. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The M60 now becomes the M70 xDrive, with 650 hp (up from the M60&#8217;s 610 hp), a 113 kWh battery (gross), 303 miles of EPA-estimated range, and a starting price of $112,675 (also including the destination fee). </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">BMW is also introducing a new entry-level variant, the xDrive45, which starts at $76,325, including the destination fee. BMW felt it was important that every model in the iX family would have at least 300 miles of range and 400 hp. So with that in mind, the new entry level trim has 312 miles of estimated range, thanks to a 100 kWh battery and 402 hp. </p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Improved design</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I&#8217;m not the biggest fan of the iX&#8217;s toothsome appearance, and the changes to the vehicle&#8217;s distinctive grille are sure to be fiercely debated across <a href="https://bmwi.bimmerpost.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1900012">BMW-themed blogs</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DonutMedia/comments/ryjnkh/i_tried_to_fix_the_abomination_of_a_grill_on_the/">Reddit threads</a>. It&#8217;s truly a massive thing to behold in person, and maybe is one of the most polarizing design choices across the EV industry &#8212; including the Tesla Cybertruck. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">And for the 2026 model year, the grille is now illuminated, making it even more in your face and difficult to ignore than ever before. BMW has also included horizontal slates across the grille to make it look more like a traditional internal combustion engine front. The overall look is cleaner and more structured, but no less divisive. The headlights are also slimmer, and their vertical LED signature aligns the iX with <a href="/bmw/623312/bmw-ev-battery-neue-klasse">BMW&#8217;s upcoming Neue Klasse models</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The interior is mostly the same as the previous model year, including the same curving screen and sharp, detailed graphics. I found the display to be a little overwhelming, to the point where most drivers are likely to opt for the familiarity of Apple CarPlay or Android Auto (both of which are available wirelessly). </p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The clear winner</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I got to test out all three, and initially, I thought the M70 was the clear winner. Even though I didn&#8217;t get too many straight lines to truly test out the improved horsepower, the vehicle&#8217;s low ground clearance and low center of gravity helps contribute to a more stable stance on the road. Still, the added weight becomes apparent in sharp corners and during braking, diminishing the agility typically associated with BMW&#8217;s M-badged vehicles. The air suspension system helps maintain composure over potholes and cracks in the road, and allows for adjustable ground clearance &#8212; though the lack of intermediate settings is limiting. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The new front bumper now includes air vents for improved aero, and the option to swap in 21-, 22-, or 23-inch wheels make for a grab bag of options for those who put a lot of stock in that M-badge. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">Initially, I thought the M70 was the clear winner</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Now, I drive a lot of EVs &#8212; about three a month on average. I drive on twisty mountain roads, gravely rural passes, and congested city streets. And I typically have an iron stomach in most scenarios. But for whatever reason, the iX made me sick as a dog, so much so that I missed most of the drive event in upstate New York this month. (I blame the new medication I was on.) BMW graciously gave me more seat time to complete my testing, which passed without a hitch. Even my car sick-prone children had no complaints. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">You can tell that BMW&#8217;s engineers took the criticisms about stiffness to heart when using the improved Comfort mode. But in Sport mode, the M70 corners better than before, with improved body control that makes it feel more composed on a twisty road. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But it&#8217;s really the all-new xDrive45 that&#8217;s the true game changer for BMW. As the new most affordable EV in the automaker&#8217;s lineup, the xDrive45 will certainly help BMW bring in new customers &#8212; and for good measure. The range is spot on, the features are luxurious without being excessive, and the ride was refined and elegant. It&#8217;s the rare base model EV that doesn&#8217;t leave you feeling like you&#8217;re selling yourself short. </p></div>
