It&#8217;s a story about life as a bot that would really just rather&#8230; not. Apple TV Plus continues to do sci-fi really well, and while I&#8217;ve seen a few folks who (as always) prefer <a href="https://www.marthawells.com/murderbot.htm"><strong>the books</strong></a>, this is one to try this weekend.</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/86831-love-death-robots"><strong>Love, Death &amp; Robots </strong><strong>season four</strong></a>. This Netflix series is a very different take on robots. A bunch of big-name filmmakers made all kinds of exciting, bizarre sci-fi shorts that seem to cross every genre and style you can think of.

Technically, if you&#8217;re in the US you&#8217;re not supposed to be able to buy this $2,700 model &#8212; but my colleague Sean Hollister <a href="/drone/666425/dji-mavic-4-pro-on-sale-preorder-adorama-bh-photo">found them on sale anyway</a>.</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><a href="https://neal.fun/internet-roadtrip/"><strong>Internet Roadtrip</strong></a>.

I&#8217;m not sure what to make of <a href="/news/666191/airbnb-new-app-services-experiences">this huge pivot</a>, honestly. Airbnb as a huge collection of travel experiences and services, rather than just homes, makes a certain kind of sense. But is this ultimately just, like, fancy Yelp? I don&#8217;t know. But I&#8217;m fascinated by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/airbnb-is-in-midlife-crisis-mode-reinvention-app-services/">how big a swing this is</a>.</span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><a href="https://blog.google/products/android/material-3-expressive-android-wearos-launch/"><strong>Android 16</strong></a><strong>.</strong> I really like <a href="/news/664316/android-material-three-expressive-design-ui-io">the new design language</a> for Android, which is bold and colorful and gives both users and developers a lot more to play with.

The Verge&#8217;s <a href="/authors/jay-peters"><strong>Jay Peters</strong></a> is going to be taking over Installer for a couple of months, finding and sharing all the good stuff just like always. (Best I can tell so far, Jay likes wonky indie games the way I like note-taking apps, so get ready to fill up your consoles in a hurry this summer.) You&#8217;ll be hearing from him here a bit for the next several weeks, too, but I&#8217;m not going anywhere just yet.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As he starts to get ramped up for all things Installer, I figured the best way for us all to get to know Jay would be to have him share his homescreen. It&#8217;s just the price of admission &#8217;round these parts. Here it is, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>The phone: </strong>An iPhone 16 Pro I got earlier this year. I upgraded from an iPhone 12 Mini that I miss desperately &#8212; the iPhone 16 Pro is too heavy and too big for me.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>The wallpaper: </strong>A gray gradient I made using Apple&#8217;s built-in wallpaper tools. I&#8217;ve tried the all-black background, but I find it jarring when I open an app and suddenly a notch or Dynamic Island appears. I made the apps gray so they&#8217;re less visually stimulating, and as a constant reminder that I should probably be doing something other than scrolling on my phone.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>The apps: </strong>Phone, Calendar, Photos, Camera, Voice Memos, Apple Maps, Clock, Settings, Messages, Notes, Reminders.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As much as possible, I rely on Apple&#8217;s stock apps because they sync well between my phone and my Mac. (Voice Memos is a particularly useful one in my line of work!) I also keep my homescreen pretty tidy by shoving most of the few apps I keep on my phone into the App Library. If I&#8217;m actively testing or using one for whatever reason, it temporarily lives at the top under the two widgets.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The countdown widget comes from an app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/days-since-quit-habit-tracker/id1445348921"><strong>Days Since</strong></a>. I&#8217;m a newish dad to a very early riser, and I realized last year that even one glass of wine made me a step too slow to keep up with my active kid. I&#8217;ve set a goal to not drink for a year just to see if I can do it, and so far, so good.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I also asked Jay to share a few things he&#8217;s into right now.
