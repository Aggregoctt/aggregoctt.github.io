<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Amazon is testing <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-ai-shopping-features-hear-the-highlights">new AI-generated audio summaries</a> that will let you listen to two AI &#8220;hosts&#8221; chat about a product&#8217;s features. Along with product details, the AI audio clips also draw information from user reviews and information from the web.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The feature is currently available for select products on Amazon&#8217;s mobile app, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00939I7EK?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Ninja Blender</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004L17FKC?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">OSEA Undaria Algae Body Oil</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BVXT8TJ?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">SHOKZ OpenRun Pro</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003PWK2A8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">SafeRest Waterproof Mattress Protector</a>. You can try it out by hitting the &#8220;Hear the highlights&#8221; button beneath the product.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The audio summaries open with a &#8220;friendly reminder&#8221; that you&#8217;re listening to an AI-generated clip, followed by an introduction to an &#8220;expert&#8221; AI host who&#8217;s supposed to give you a rundown of a product&#8217;s features. It&#8217;s similar to <a href="/news/657785/google-audio-overviews-ai-podcasts-50-languages">Google&#8217;s AI-generated audio overviews</a>, which have two AI hosts discuss your research, documents, or slides in a podcast-like format.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In the clip for the SHOKZ OpenRun Pro, the AI host introduces us to &#8220;Max,&#8221; who says the key difference about these headphones is that they &#8220;conduct sound through your cheekbones instead of going into your ears.&#8221; The AI host then follows up with questions about the headphones, like who would benefit from the design and whether the sound quality is up to par.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;While the microphone gets praise for noise cancellation, some users find they&#8217;re not loud enough for an immersive music experience,&#8221; the AI &#8220;expert&#8221; Max says. &#8220;But customers do mention they&#8217;re better than earpods in certain situations.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Amazon&#8217;s AI-generated audio summaries are currently only available to some customers in the US, but the company plans on bringing them to more products and customers in the &#8220;coming months.&#8221;</p></div>
