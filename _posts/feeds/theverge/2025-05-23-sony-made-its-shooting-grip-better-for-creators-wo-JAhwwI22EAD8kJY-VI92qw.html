<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Sony <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-electronics-launches-gp-vpt3-multi-function-shooting-grip-and-the-rmt-vp2-wireless-remote-commander-302461264.html">announced a new version of its multi-function shooting grip</a> and compact tripod that puts its wireless controls on a removable remote. Previous versions featured controls that could operate basic functions of an attached camera while holding onto the grip. The new GP-VPT3 makes them even more useful for solo content creators who can now operate a camera while standing in frame in front of it.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Sony <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/imaging-accessories/imaging-compact-camera-accessories/p/gpvpt2btb" rel="sponsored">still sells the older version</a> for $139.99, but the added functionality of the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/imaging-accessories/grips-tripods-remotes/p/gpvpt3b?utm_source=AlphaUniverse&amp;utm_medium=Web&amp;utm_campaign=Article" rel="sponsored">new GP-VPT3 Multi-Function Shooting Grip</a> comes with a small price bump to $159.99. The bundled remote, which Sony calls the RMT-VP2 Wireless Remote Commander, is sold separately for $89.99 for those who don&#8217;t need the grip or don&#8217;t want to replace their existing one.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The GP-VPT3 is compatible with Sony&#8217;s Alpha Series cameras and smaller vlogging cameras like last year&#8217;s ZV-E10 II. It can support up to 3.3 pounds, which means you can potentially use it with larger lenses too, as long as they don&#8217;t protrude too far off the camera and shift its center of balance.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The RMT-VP2 remote connects to Sony&#8217;s cameras over Bluetooth and has a range of about 33 feet. It includes a shutter button, a dedicated movie record button, a rocker that can be used to control zoom or focus, a button for turning autofocus on and off, and a C1 button that can be customized to control other functions.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As with previous versions of the grip, the new GP-VPT3 connects to a camera using its tripod mount and has a flexible head allowing an attached device to tilt forwards and back and swivel 360 degrees. It can function as an ergonomic handle, putting the most important camera controls at finger&#8217;s reach when shooting one-handed. It also unfolds and becomes a stubby tripod, making it easier to set the camera up at a specific angle for timelapses, or for filming yourself.</p></div>
