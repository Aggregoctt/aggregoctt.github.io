It says the work is already &#8220;underway&#8221; and should be mostly done in about two weeks. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If the Trump administration fulfills that commitment, it&#8217;ll be a significant victory for farmers and <a href="/news/610765/trump-government-websites-cdc-fda-health-data-court-order">other Americans</a> <a href="/tech/656714/trump-disaster-hurricane-flood-famine-data-purge-usaid">who rely on scientific data</a> that has <a href="/news/604484/donald-trumps-data-purge-has-begun">disappeared from federal websites</a> since January.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">&#8220;We&#8217;re ecstatic.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;I&#8217;ll be real frank, it feels good to win one, right? Farmers have been so put upon by the actions of this administration that, you know, it feels good to be able to say, we have something for you. This is back. You can rely on these resources,&#8221; says Marcie Craig, executive director of the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York. &#8220;We&#8217;re ecstatic.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The group <a href="/news/618917/federal-usda-website-climate-change-organic-farmers">filed suit in February</a> alongside two environmental organizations, alleging that the USDA threatened organic farmers&#8217; livelihoods by removing information they relied on to help them make decisions about planting crops and managing their land &#8212; key resources as <a href="/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc">climate change leads to more unpredictable and extreme weather</a>. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">One of the resources removed by the USDA is an online tool called the &#8220;Climate Risk Viewer&#8221; that showed the impacts of climate change on rivers and water sheds, and how that might affect water supplies in the future.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;We&#8217;re really glad that USDA recognized that this blatantly unlawful purge is harming farmers and researchers and advocates all across the country, and we&#8217;re ready to ensure that USDA follows through on this promise,&#8221; Jeffrey Stein, an associate attorney with the nonprofit legal organization Earthjustice that represented the plaintiffs, tells The Verge. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The initial complaint accused the USDA of violating the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) that gives the public the right to access key records from any federal agency, the Paperwork Reduction Act that stipulates adequate notice before changing access to information, and the Administrative Procedure Act that governs the way federal agencies develop regulations. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">President Trump&#8217;s <a href="/2025/1/20/24347870/trump-executive-order-fossil-fuels-environment">backing of the fossil fuel industry</a> has also <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-trumps-funding-freeze-is-affecting-american-farmers">stripped farmers of federal funding through climate-related programs</a>. The Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York has lost nearly half of its budget this year due to funding freezes, which it has been trying to make up for through donations, according to Craig. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;This has been one of so many cuts. You know, pain by a thousand cuts,&#8221; Craig says. &#8220;This [legal victory] was good &#8230; then, of course, after the initial feeling, you sit back, you take a breath, and you say, &#8216;and we still have a whole lot of work to do.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>
