excerpt: Anthropic has introduced Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, its latest generation
  of hybrid-reasoning AI models optimized for coding tasks and solving complex problems. 
  Claude Opus 4 is Anthropic’s most powerful AI model to date, according to the company’s
  announcement, and capable of working continuously on long-running tasks for “several

<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Anthropic has introduced Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, its latest generation of hybrid-reasoning AI models optimized for coding tasks and solving complex problems. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Claude Opus 4 is Anthropic&#8217;s most powerful AI model to date, according to the company&#8217;s announcement, and capable of working continuously on long-running tasks for &#8220;several hours.&#8221; In customer tests, Anthropic said that Opus 4 performed autonomously for seven hours, significantly <a href="/2024/10/10/24266333/ai-agents-assistants-openai-google-deepmind-bots">expanding the possibilities for AI agents</a>. The company also described its new flagship as the &#8220;best coding model in the world,&#8221; with Anthropic&#8217;s benchmarks showing that Opus 4 outperformed <a href="/news/635502/google-gemini-2-5-reasoning-ai-model">Google&#8217;s Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>, <a href="/news/649941/openai-o3-o4-mini-model-images-reasoning">OpenAI&#8217;s o3 reasoning</a>, and <a href="/news/647896/openai-chatgpt-gpt-4-1-mini-nano-launch-availability">GPT-4.1 models</a> in coding tasks and using &#8220;tools&#8221; like web search.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Claude Sonnet 4 is a more affordable and efficiency-focused model that&#8217;s better suited to general tasks, which supersedes the <a href="/news/618440/anthropic-claude-3-7-sonnet-ai-model-hybrid-reasoning">3.7 Sonnet model released in February</a>. Anthropic says Sonnet 4 delivers &#8220;superior coding and reasoning&#8221; while providing more precise responses. The company adds that both models are 65 percent less likely to take shortcuts and loopholes to complete tasks compared to 3.7 Sonnet and they&#8217;re better at storing key information for long-term tasks when developers provide Claude with local file access.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">A new feature introduced for both Claude 4 models is &#8220;thinking summaries,&#8221; which condenses the chatbots&#8217; reasoning process into easily understandable insights. An &#8220;extended thinking&#8221; feature is also launching in beta that allows users to switch the models between modes for reasoning or using tools to improve the performance and accuracy of responses.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 are available on the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud&#8217;s Vertex AI platform, and both models are included in paid Claude plans alongside the extended thinking beta feature. Free users can only access Claude Sonnet 4 for now.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In addition to the new models, Anthropic&#8217;s Claude Code agentic command-line tool is now generally available following its limited preview in February. Anthropic also says it&#8217;s shifting to provide &#8220;more frequent model updates,&#8221; as the company tries to keep up with competition from OpenAI, Google, and Meta.</p></div>
