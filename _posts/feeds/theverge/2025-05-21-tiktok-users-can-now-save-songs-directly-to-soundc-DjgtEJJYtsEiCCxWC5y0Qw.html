<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">TikTok users will now be able to save tracks they discover straight to their SoundCloud app. On Wednesday, the two companies announced they&#8217;re partnering to expand <a href="/2024/2/22/24079965/tiktok-music-features-are-expanding">an existing TikTok feature</a> that was previously available to users of music streaming platforms like Apple Music and Spotify.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The &#8220;add to music app&#8221; button appears when a TikTok user clicks on an audio track added to a video. Saved songs are automatically added to a TikTok playlist on users&#8217; default music streaming service. The integration streamlines a process many TikTok users do organically: find new music on the video app. The &#8220;add to music app&#8221; feature is an easy way for listeners to take their discoveries off the app (and for artists, especially indie musicians, to grow their fanbase beyond just passive TikTok listeners).</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Over the past five or so years, TikTok has proved to be a powerful driver of pop music &#8212; not just for emerging artists but also for household names. Artists plan and unveil <a href="/2024/4/19/24134795/taylor-swift-ttpd-tiktok-hub-universal-music-group">TikTok-specific marketing</a> to hype up their new music and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/25/older-music-has-been-getting-a-second-life-on-tiktok-data-shows">older songs get a second wind</a> as a new audience on social media discovers their work. Even Taylor Swift recognizes she needs her music on the platform: last year, as TikTok&#8217;s licensing deal with Universal Music Group expired and spiraled into a nasty back and forth, UMG artists&#8217; music <a href="/2024/2/5/24062260/tiktok-universal-music-group-audio-removal-ruining-viral-trends-thirst-edits">was pulled from the video platform</a>. Swift&#8217;s music <a href="/2024/4/11/24127406/taylor-swifts-music-tiktok-umg-deal">reappeared</a> before a deal was publicly announced (and just in time to promote her upcoming album). There was even <a href="/2023/9/14/23873516/billboard-tiktok-top-50-chart-songs">a Billboard TikTok chart</a> ranking the app&#8217;s hits, though it was short-lived; the chart was discontinued earlier this year.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">TikTok says that since rolling out the &#8220;add to music app&#8221; feature last year, songs have been saved more than a billion times. The SoundCloud integration begins rolling out today to all users.</p></div>
