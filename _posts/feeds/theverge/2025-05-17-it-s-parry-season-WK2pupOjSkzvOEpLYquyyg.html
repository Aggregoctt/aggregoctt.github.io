<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you like games with parrying, there are two great new ways to get your fix: Doom: The Dark Ages and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. These very different games &#8212; one is a fast-paced first-person shooter, the other a turn-based fantasy RPG &#8212; approach the mechanic in very different ways.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Let&#8217;s start with Doom. One of the big new additions to the game is a giant shield for the Doom Slayer, and you can use it to block projectiles or enemy attacks. The game helpfully signals anything that you can parry in a bright neon green that&#8217;s easy to see as you&#8217;re rushing around and destroying hordes of demons.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">When a green projectile gets within range or an enemy does a green attack, you can press the parry button at the right time to deflect the danger with a huge reverberation of your shield and an action-movie-like moment of slow motion. Like most of modern Doom&#8217;s action, it all looks, feels, and sounds very satisfying. But parries are also critical for fights, as they can open up an opportunity to hit the enemy with a punch or a few shots from whatever monstrous gun you&#8217;re wielding.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">Stay keen for something green</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In intense battles, I&#8217;m always hunting for green glints to find things to parry to potentially gain an advantage. When an enemy shoots a spread of bullets with some green interspersed, I&#8217;ll even run toward the danger to get in a good deflection. Some weapon upgrades have perks tied to parries, too, giving you many incentives to stay keen for something green.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Doom, very helpfully, has a setting that lets you change the timing for the parry window whenever you want. I have no shame in admitting that I&#8217;ve occasionally made the parry window as wide as the game allows; yes, it lowers the difficulty, but I like parrying every chance I can.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Expedition 33&#8217;s parrying system is just as thrilling and impactful, but shifts from fast-paced action to turn-based battles. When it&#8217;s an enemy&#8217;s turn in a battle, they&#8217;ll often wind up their giant swords, axes, or fists for flashy, multistep attack combos, and you can parry each hit if you time things right.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Every successful parry regains one AP, which you&#8217;ll spend during your turn to use skills. More powerful skills typically have higher AP costs, so the more blows you parry, the better equipped you&#8217;ll be on your next turn. Parry all of an enemy&#8217;s attacks on their turn and you&#8217;ll do a counter (which also has an action-movie-like slow-motion effect) that can be a very helpful way to chip away at a health bar.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">That&#8217;s not easy, though: Expedition 33&#8217;s gives you a very tight window to press the parry button in time to block a hit, and if you miss the window, you&#8217;ll take some damage. Missing multiple parries on a single turn might drain your health bar from full to empty, and given how tricky the game&#8217;s enemies can get with staggering their hits or faking you out, that will probably happen often.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The game lets you dodge enemy attacks, which has a much wider timing window, but you don&#8217;t gain AP and you won&#8217;t get a chance to counter. I found myself leaning toward parries far more than dodges: despite the risks, landing a successful series of parries, especially in a high-stakes battle, was usually worth the trial and error because of how cool it looked and how much it helped in a fight.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I do wish Expedition 33 had a setting to adjust the parrying windows just slightly (and if you&#8217;re on PC, there&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/28">a mod that can help with that</a>). But I also get why the timing is so tough: the rewards are high, but so are the costs.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Parrying can be a divisive mechanic, especially when it&#8217;s challenging. That&#8217;s why people bounce off of games like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Nine Sols. But Doom and Expedition 33 both offer new and interesting takes on the idea that show just how rewarding a good parry can be.</p></div>
