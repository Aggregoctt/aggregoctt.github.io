<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun &#8211; Words of Vengeance is a new typing game based on Warhammer 40,000 and it&#8217;s available now for free on PC <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3533730%2FWarhammer_40000_Boltgun__Words_of_Vengeance%2F" rel="sponsored">via Steam</a>. The dark sci-fi spin on a typing teacher was shadow-dropped during a series of announcements made during the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4A1s4DH78w">Warhammer Skulls Showcase</a>. Also shown was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG19wrCGR5g">trailer for Boltgun 2</a>, a sequel to Auroch Digital&#8217;s first-person shooter the new typing game is based on.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Words of Vengeance follows in the footsteps of games like <a href="/2013/10/30/5046068/play-this-typing-of-the-dead-overkill-sequel-released">Typing of the Dead</a> where you type on-screen prompts as quickly and as accurately as you can to defeat enemies and progress in on-rails levels. It&#8217;s set in the world of Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun and uses the same pixelated 3D aesthetic with plenty of blood and violence, except the blood is spilled by typing.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As a fan of mechanical keyboards, I personally love occasionally <a href="/23623723/touch-typing-keyboard-home-row-qwerty-dvorak-colemak-how-to">firing up typing tests</a> to hear what the latest keyboard I&#8217;m obsessing over sounds and feels like. But as much as I love <a href="http://monkeytype.com">Monkeytype</a> or <a href="https://www.keybr.com/">Keybr</a>, an actual typing game offers a different kind of fun. The thought of going full boomer-shooter with my proper grammar and punctuation exercises just has me more stoked than ever. Plus, it&#8217;s free. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Brother! It&#8217;s time to get those fingers moving. More blood for the blood god!</p></div>
