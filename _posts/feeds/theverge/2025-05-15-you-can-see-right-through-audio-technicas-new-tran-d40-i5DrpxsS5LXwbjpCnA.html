Following the reveal of its <a href="/news/650584/audio-technica-hotaru-turntable-record-player-vinyl-levitate">floating, glowing Hotaru turntable</a> last month, the company has <a href="https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/at-lpa2">announced its new AT-LPA2</a> featuring a chassis and platter made from transparent acrylic. With electronics like its power supply and playback controls packed into a separate unit that can be kept out of sight, the turntable is a reminder that transparent tech can still look modern and sleek.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The AT-LPA2 features a similar design to the <a href="https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/at-lp2022">Audio-Technica AT-LP2022 turntable</a> that was released in January 2023 to help commemorate the company&#8217;s 60th anniversary. The previous version was limited to just 3,000 units made available worldwide and sold for $1,200. The new AT-LPA2 is available starting today, and while its rollout won&#8217;t be as limited, it now costs $2,000.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The base of the turntable is made from a 30mm thick slab of high-density transparent acrylic, while the spinning platter atop is made from the same material that&#8217;s 20mm thick. It not only makes for a striking design, but acrylic is also an effective material for dampening vibrations which improves playback performance and helps keep the turntable operating quietly.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Direct drive turntables, in which the spinning platter is part of the electric motor, offer superior performance over those that use a separate motor connected with a belt. But in this case, a belt drive actually serves to enhance the aesthetics of the AT-LPA2. To ensure accurate playback, Audio-Technica includes an optical sensor that monitors the platter&#8217;s rotation so it maintains a constant speed of either 33 1/3 or 45rpm.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The company redesigned the tone arm included with the limited edition model, but it&#8217;s still made from carbon fiber to help reduce its weight and includes interchangeable counterweights that can be added and removed to help keep the arm balanced with different cartridges.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">To help keep the turntable&#8217;s chassis as transparent as possible, playback controls and other buttons are included on a separate unit that also houses the power supply. That approach not only lets you position the control unit out of sight since it&#8217;s not transparent and doesn&#8217;t match the AT-LPA2&#8217;s aesthetic, Audio-Technica says it also isolates the turntable&#8217;s audio components from power supply noise &#8220;resulting in a cleaner, more accurate sound.&#8221;</p></div>
