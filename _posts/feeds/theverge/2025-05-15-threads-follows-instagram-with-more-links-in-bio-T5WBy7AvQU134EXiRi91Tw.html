<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Threads is making it easier for creators to share personal links with their communities and followers. The <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/03/new-threads-features-more-personalized-experience-you-control/">link-sharing update announced today</a> now allows Threads users to add up to five links to their account bios and provides performance insight that shows how many people have visited links shared in posts and profiles.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Meta previously only allowed a single link to be added to profile bios on Threads, and this update brings the platform in line with <a href="/2023/4/18/23688081/instagram-link-in-bio-five-links">Instagram&#8217;s link-sharing capabilities</a>. While creators could use services like <a href="https://linktr.ee/">Linktree</a>, which provides a landing page where multiple links can be displayed, for that single link slot, having the URLs for up to five links directly displayed on profiles will make it easier to see which link options are available, such as newsletters, podcasts, articles, and merchandise shopfronts.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Threads is also working on providing users with new audience management features that compare week-over-week performance data for the number of posts made, total views, replies, and new followers. Meta says that these insight recaps are &#8220;coming soon,&#8221; alongside personalized tips that will be shown to creators to &#8220;inspire new ways to engage your community.&#8221;</p></div>
