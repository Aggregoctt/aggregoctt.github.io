<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google is bringing <a href="https://developers.home.google.com/io/2025">Gemini intelligence to its Home APIs</a>, allowing smart home developers and manufacturers to tap into <a href="/2024/8/6/24213639/google-gemini-intelligence-ai-google-home-nest-aware">Gemini&#8217;s AI-powered features</a> and potentially making your smart home a lot, well, smarter. The company announced the news <a href="https://developers.home.google.com/io/2025">in a blog post</a> during the Google I/O developers conference this week.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Last summer, Google added <a href="/2024/8/6/24213639/google-gemini-intelligence-ai-google-home-nest-aware">several new Gemini-powered capabilities</a> to its own platform, and now it&#8217;s extending those to others. This includes access to AI-powered camera analytics from Google Nest cameras and creating smart home routines using conversational language.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The company also announced new triggers for automations, including date and weather. Developers with access to the APIs will be able to pull these features into their apps, meaning that, as a user, you might experience them without ever opening the Google Home app.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">For example, access to the <a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Google-Home-Update-Fall-2024-Unlock-a-whole-new-level-of-Google-Home/ba-p/653136#:~:text=This%20means%20a,here%20today%3F%222">AI-generated descriptions and search capabilities</a> of Nest cameras could allow a company like ADT (which is <a href="/2024/5/15/24156573/adt-plus-google-home-smart-security-system-trusted-neighbor">already using Google Home APIs</a>) to bring these features into its own home security app. So a user could ask questions like, &#8220;Did the kids leave their bikes in the driveway?&#8221; In addition to the AI features, developers can also pull livestreaming, event history, two-way talk, and camera settings for Google&#8217;s Nest cameras into their apps. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">With Gemini in Home APIs, developers can allow users to set up smart home automations and routines within their apps with conversational language; they can just say what they want to do. Gemini can also proactively suggest automations by analyzing the devices in a user&#8217;s home, according to Google.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">All of this should enable companies to offer more advanced smart home control within their own apps, potentially eliminating some of the more complicated and confusing setup processes and allowing users to get more out of their smart home devices without spending lots of time manually configuring them. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google originally launched its <a href="/2024/5/15/24157154/google-home-api-matter-smart-home-chromecast-google-tv">Home APIs at I/O last year</a> as a way for developers to tap into Google Home-compatible devices and automations. This includes any devices connected through <a href="/23568091/matter-compatible-devices-accessories-apple-amazon-google-samsung">Matter</a>, which boosts the number of devices Google Home can control to over 750 million, according to the blog post. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Some companies, including <a href="/2024/5/15/24156573/adt-plus-google-home-smart-security-system-trusted-neighbor">ADT</a>, <a href="/news/638162/yale-smart-lock-with-matter-works-with-google-home">Yale</a>, and <a href="/2024/12/3/24312078/eve-android-app-launches-eve-thermo-thread-matter">Eve</a>, got early access to those APIs. Another, <a href="/news/638234/first-alert-smart-smoke-alarm-google-nest-protect-replacement">First Alert</a>, recently launched a smart <a href="/news/638234/first-alert-smart-smoke-alarm-google-nest-protect-replacement">smoke alarm</a> that uses Home APIs to interconnect with Google&#8217;s Nest Protect smoke alarm. Google has <a href="/news/638171/google-discontinuing-nest-protect-smoke-alarm-nest-x-yale-smart-lock">stopped manufacturing</a> the Protect, but as it can continue to work for at least 10 years, the First Alert device could help homeowners maintain interconnected smoke alarms as they upgrade their system.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">This week, Google announced that smart lighting manufacturer Cync is integrating Google Home APIs, allowing users to control any device they have synced to Google Home in the Cync app. Smart home platform <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tuya.com%2F" rel="sponsored">Tuya Smart is also working with the APIs</a>, and Google said iRobot is leveraging the APIs to integrate Google&#8217;s Home and Away feature into its app. This would allow select Roomba vacuums to automatically start cleaning when you leave home &#8212; an option Roombas have had with <a href="/22961597/robot-vacuum-connect-control-amazon-alexa-assistant-roomba-roborock-how-to#:~:text=Control%20your%20robot%20vacuum%20with%20Alexa%20Routines,or%20isn%E2%80%99t%20detected%20by%20a%20motion%20sensor).">Amazon Alexa</a> for a while. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Developers who use the Home APIs will be able to control those devices and experiences through the <a href="/2025/1/23/24350541/google-gemini-ai-smart-home-controls-launch">Gemini smartphone app</a> and <a href="/2024/12/13/24320673/gemini-google-assistant-available-nest-smart-speakers">Nest smart speakers</a>, with support for smart displays, Google TV, and the Pixel Tablet coming later this year, according to Google. They also teased a new Home Summary widget <a href="/2024/10/15/24270909/android-15-smart-home-control-screensaver-pixel-tablet">for the Pixel Tablet</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Most of those devices are controllable by voice, and while <a href="/news/629904/google-assistant-gemini-moving-on">Google Assistant has been officially retired</a> on smartphones in favor of Gemini, it&#8217;s still around on smart speakers and displays. However, the company has begun rolling out a &#8220;new experience&#8221; powered by Gemini to its <a href="/2024/12/13/24320673/gemini-google-assistant-available-nest-smart-speakers">Nest Audio and Nest Mini 1st and 2nd-gen speakers</a> for users in its <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/12494697?hl=en">Public Preview program</a> who have a Nest Aware subscription. It sounds like the rest of the hardware lineup won&#8217;t be far behind.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But don&#8217;t expect to see these new Gemini-powered features in loads of third-party apps soon. According to Google, the Gemini in Home APIs will be available via an early access program &#8220;to a small group of partners&#8221; later this year. </p></div>
