excerpt: 'When it launches next summer, Christopher Nolan’s adaptation of Greek epic
  The Odyssey will be historic in more ways than one: it will be the first feature
  film ever shot entirely on IMAX film. The Odyssey isn’t the first film to be shot
  entirely using IMAX hardware — that honor belongs to Avengers: Infinity War [&#8230;]'
