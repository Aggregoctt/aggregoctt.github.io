<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you got a kick out of <a href="/2017/3/13/14905498/baby-driver-review-edgar-wright-sxsw-2017">Baby Driver</a>, there&#8217;s a very good chance you&#8217;re going to be into Darren Aronofsky&#8217;s upcoming black comedy / thriller, Caught Stealing.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Adapted from Charlie Huston&#8217;s 2005 novel of the same name, Caught Stealing tells the wild take of Hank Thompson (Austin Butler), a former high school baseball prodigy whose dreams of going pro came to an end following a career-ending injury. Though life hasn&#8217;t worked out the way Hank expected, things seem to be going pretty well for him in the movie&#8217;s new trailer. Hank&#8217;s girlfriend Yvonne (Zo&#235; Kravitz) loves him, he&#8217;s got a solid job working as a bartender, and his eccentric neighbor Russ (Matt Smith) tends to keep to himself.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But when Hank agrees to watch Russ&#8217; cat, he doesn&#8217;t realize that he&#8217;s putting himself at risk of dealing with some of his neighbor&#8217;s shady business partners. And it isn&#8217;t long before Hank finds himself having to run from and fight off members of multiple crime syndicates. Compared to the novel, Aronofsky&#8217;s Caught Stealing looks like it&#8217;s going to be a bit more of a high-octane thrill ride, tonally speaking. With Huston writing the film&#8217;s script as well, the new adaptation probably won&#8217;t veer all that far away from its source material. But we won&#8217;t know until Caught Stealing hits theaters on August 29th.</p></div>
