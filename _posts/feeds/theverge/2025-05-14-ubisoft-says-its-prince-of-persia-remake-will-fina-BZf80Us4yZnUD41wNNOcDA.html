<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake <a href="/2020/9/10/21429389/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-xbox-one-ps4-announcement-ubisoft">was originally supposed to arrive</a> on January 21st, 2021. Since then, it&#8217;s been delayed three times, got <a href="/2022/5/3/23055673/ubisoft-prince-persia-remastered-pune-mumbai-montreal">shipped to a different studio</a>, reportedly started over from scratch, and <a href="/2024/4/10/24126462/prince-of-persia-sands-remake-yuri-lowenthal">may have lost the original writer and amazing performances of its English voice actor</a>. But Ubisoft has revealed the game is finally on the way &#8212; and will go on sale before April 2026, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-release-by-april-2026/">as spotted by Insider Gaming</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In <a href="http://irtable.com/appJQntCmOa2q2a5C/tblpr7UqfWXvDuH8G/viwviiWY2XXTIhLm8?blocks=hide">Ubisoft&#8217;s latest earnings release</a>, the company reveals that it expects the Prince of Persia remake to be one of the games that will help its bottom line during the next fiscal year, FY2025-2026. Since Ubisoft&#8217;s FY2024-2025 ended on March 31st, 2025, that means the new game will have to go on sale before March 31st, 2026.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But that also means it could arrive any time now. We&#8217;re already two months into FY2025-2026. I&#8217;d be surprised if we didn&#8217;t get an announcement <a href="/news/603313/summer-game-fest-returns-on-june-6th">at the Summer Game Fest next month</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Ubisoft suggests that its top games in FY2025-2026 will be <a href="/games/637717/assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-assassinations">Assassin&#8217;s Creed Shadows</a> and Siege X, but names Prince of Persia as one of the games that&#8217;ll contribute alongside Anno 117: Pax Romana, Rainbow Six Mobile and The Division Resurgence.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I&#8217;m eagerly awaiting the chance to try it, as the original is one of my top five favorite games of all time. I loved its storytelling, voice acting, incredible music, and its then-groundbreaking ability to rewind time. But I won&#8217;t deny I&#8217;m a bit worried.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Both Yuri Lowenthal &#8212; the Prince&#8217;s iconic English-language voice actor &#8212; and Prince of Persia creator Jordan Mechner were attached to the remake when it was announced in 2020. (Lowenthal once suggested the remake was going to &#8220;keep all of Jordan Mechner&#8217;s brilliant writing&#8221; and thanked Ubisoft for not picking a &#8220;younger, hotter actor&#8221; instead of him.) But after development moved to Ubisoft Montr&#233;al in 2022, <a href="/2024/4/10/24126462/prince-of-persia-sands-remake-yuri-lowenthal">it&#8217;s not clear whether either is still involved</a>. Here&#8217;s hoping there was good reason to overhaul the game, unlike <a href="/2020/9/30/21495611/spider-man-remastered-peter-parker-tom-holland-ps5-playstation-5">that other time a game company replaced Yuri Lowenthal&#8217;s face</a>!</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The remake is far from the most-delayed game at Ubisoft, of course: I believe <a href="/2024/6/18/24181213/i-got-excited-for-beyond-good-and-evil-2-there-for-a-sec-but-i-guess-the-remastered-original-will-do">Beyond Good and Evil 2</a> currently holds the all-time record at over 15 years since it was first announced. Incidentally, the first BG&amp;E game shipped just a month after Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.</p></div>
