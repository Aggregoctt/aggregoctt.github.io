<p class="has-text-align-none">The Sega Dreamcast wasn’t the first home console to store game saves on a portable memory card, but its virtual memory unit (VMU) stood out with a built-in screen, controls, and playable mini games. 8BitMod’s upcoming VMU Pro offers the same functionality as Sega’s original, but it’s rebuilt from the ground up with upgrades that include a full-color screen and enough processing power to use it as a handheld emulator for retro games.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Pricing for the VMU Pro hasn’t been revealed yet, but 8BitMods <a href="https://x.com/8bitmods/status/1921227232376148142">shared a teaser video on X</a> over the weekend confirming that preorders will open on May 15th at 1PM ET <a href="https://8bitmods.com/">through its online store</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Introducing the VMU Pro. The last VMU you'll ever need for your Dreamcast.<br/><br/>But it's not just for your Dreamcast. The VMU Pro can emulate your favourite 8-bit era handhelds and games consoles like the Game Boy Color, NES and Master System on a beautiful 16-bit color IPS TFT… <a href="https://t.co/UGbUfbid3w">pic.twitter.com/UGbUfbid3w</a></p>— 8BitMods (@8bitmods) <a href="https://twitter.com/8bitmods/status/1921227232376148142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For years modders have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Db2IqCgxw">turning the Sega VMU into a more functional handheld gaming device</a> by completely swapping out its electronics with more capable hardware, but at the cost of it still functioning as a memory card for the Dreamcast. That’s what makes the VMU Pro unique. Although it’s been upgraded with a 16-bit IPS TFT color screen and enough power to emulate NES, Sega Master System, and even Game Boy Color titles, it can still be inserted into an original Dreamcast controller and used to store save game data.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Other upgrades include a rechargeable battery (the original Dreamcast VMU was notorious for going through CR2032 coin cell batteries when used on its own), MP3 playback for those living without a smartphone, the ability to copy and backup save game data directly from an original VMU, Wi-Fi, and unlimited storage through microSD memory cards.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The retro emulation on a full-color screen is a fun feature, but if that’s the only reason you’re considering the VMU Pro, the <a href="https://anbernic.com/en-ca/products/rg-nano">Anbernic RG Nano</a> offers far superior emulation (including 3D consoles like the N64 and PS1) on a similarly-sized handheld. The VMU Pro will appeal more to those who still have a Sega Dreamcast in regular play rotation but are looking for a more reliable and easier way to store and swap game saves.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s assuming the VMU Pro isn’t going to be prohibitively expensive. In 2022, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/21/23365268/sega-dreamcast-vmu-virtual-memory-unit-card-2022-fundraiser-indiegogo-console">Dreamware Enterprises launched its own upgraded VMU called the VM2</a> with a backlit but monochromatic and pixelated screen for $114. It was a pricey upgrade for a console that Sega no longer supports, so hopefully three years of electronics evolution will result in a cheaper price tag for the VMU Pro.</p>
