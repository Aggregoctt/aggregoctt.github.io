It&#8217;s becoming Google Beam and will soon launch inside an HP-branded device with a light field display and six cameras to create a 3D image of the person you&#8217;re chatting with on a video call.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Companies like Deloitte, Duolingo, and Salesforce have already said that they will add HP&#8217;s Google Beam devices to their offices.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google has announced Imagen 4, the latest version of its AI text-to-image generator, which the company says is better at generating text and offers the ability to export images in more formats, like square and landscape.

It&#8217;s capable of considering &#8220;multiple hypotheses before responding&#8221; and will only be available to trusted testers first.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google has also made its Gemini 2.5 Flash model available to everyone on its Gemini app and is bringing improvements to the cost-efficient model in Google AI Studio <a href="/news/670853/google-is-rolling-out-an-updated-version-of-gemini-2-5-flash">ahead of a wider rollout</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Xreal and Google are teaming up on Project Aura, a new pair of smart glasses that use the Android XR platform for mixed-reality devices. We don&#8217;t know much about the glasses just yet, but they&#8217;ll come with Gemini integration and a large field-of-view, along with what appears to be built-in cameras and microphones.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google is also partnering with <a href="/google-io/670013/android-xr-warby-parker-gentle-monster-smart-glassesi-io-2025">Samsung, Gentle Monster, and Warby Parker</a> to create other Android XR smart glasses, as well.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Project Astra could already use your phone&#8217;s camera to &#8220;see&#8221; the objects around you, but the latest prototype will let it complete tasks on your behalf, even if you don&#8217;t explicitly ask it to. The model can choose to speak based on what it&#8217;s seeing, such as pointing out a mistake on your homework.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google is building its AI assistant into Chrome.

The feature will also take your recipient&#8217;s tone into account, allowing it to suggest more formal responses in a conversation with your boss, for example.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Gmail&#8217;s upgraded smart replies will be available in English on the web, iOS, and Android when it launches through Google Labs in July.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google is testing a new &#8220;try-it-on&#8221; feature that lets you upload a full-length photo of yourself to see how shirts, pants, dresses, or skirts might look on you. The feature uses an AI model that &#8220;understands the human body and nuances of clothing.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google will also soon let you shop in AI Mode, as well as use an &#8220;agentic checkout&#8221; feature that can purchase products on your behalf.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If Chrome detects that your password&#8217;s been compromised, Google says the browser will soon be able to &#8220;generate a strong replacement&#8221; and automatically update it on supported websites. The feature launches later this year, and Google says that it will always ask for consent before changing your passwords.</p></div>
