<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Samsung may not be the first (or perhaps not even the fifth) company that springs to mind when you consider the major players in smart speakers, but it&#8217;s tough to argue with the appeal of a speaker that&#8217;s also a mountable frame. Similar to the <a href="/news/661491/sonos-ikea-symfonisk-discontinued">discontinued Ikea x Sonos Symfonisk</a>, <a href="/2024/1/7/24029243/samsung-music-frame-speaker-announced-specs-features">Samsung&#8217;s Music Frame</a> can play tunes from one of many audio sources, though it&#8217;s more customizable, letting you slot in up to a 8 x 10-inch physical image (8 x 8 is also an option). It&#8217;s elegant and capable, like the company&#8217;s own very popular The Frame TV lineup, and it&#8217;s 69 percent off right now at Woot.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Music Frame is <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-samsung-smart-music-frame-3" rel="sponsored">$124.99</a> (originally $399.99), and comes with a one-year manufacturer warranty through Woot. This handily beats the previous low price of $195 at Amazon back in March.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">This multitalented smart speaker can rest upon its included stand or be mounted to your wall. It supports Spotify Connect, Chromecast, Tidal Hi-Fi content, and Apple AirPlay. If you have select Samsung entertainment products, it supports Q-Symphony to serve as an extra channel in your surround sound setup. As an alternative to slotting in a photo, you can <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shutterfly.com%2Fwall-art%2Fsamsung-music-frame-art-panel%2F" rel="sponsored">customize your own Art Panel via Shutterfly</a> to fit over the Music Frame&#8217;s 12.9 x 12.9-inch face.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Woot limits purchases to three per user, and it&#8217;s kind of wild to think that buying that many through Woot would still have you saving $25 off the current cost of a single Music Frame via Samsung or Amazon.</p></div>
