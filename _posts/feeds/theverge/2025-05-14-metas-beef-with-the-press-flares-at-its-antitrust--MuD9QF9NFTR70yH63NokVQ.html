<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Long-simmering tension between Silicon Valley and the press that covers it is surfacing during the Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s antitrust trial against Meta. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">During a heated cross-examination of the FTC&#8217;s key economic expert, Scott Hemphill, Meta&#8217;s lead attorney, Mark Hansen, noted that Hemphill joined Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and former Biden official Tim Wu in <a href="/2019/5/9/18540407/facebook-co-founder-chris-hughes-op-ed-break-up-online-speech-first-amendment-problems">pitching regulators</a> on an antitrust probe of the company back in 2019. The pitch deck for the probe that was shown in court included &#8220;public recognition&#8221; of the company&#8217;s aggressive acquisition strategy from two reporters: Kara Swisher, who currently hosts two podcasts for The Verge&#8217;s parent company, Vox Media, and Om Malik, the founder of the early tech blog GigaOm who is now a venture capitalist.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In an attempt to undercut Hemphill&#8217;s credibility, Hansen caught Swisher and Malik in the crossfire. He called Malik a &#8220;failed blogger&#8221; with an axe to grind against Meta. He then suggested that Swisher, whom he referred to as a Vanity Fair columnist (she last wrote for the site <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/contributor/kara-swisher">in 2015</a>), was similarly biased against the company. In court, he <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/kara-swisher-calls-mark-zuckerberg-112141129.html">projected a headline</a> about her recently calling Mark Zuckerberg a &#8220;small little creature with a shriveled soul.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The 2019 pitch deck shown at court by Hansen also cited a Post story to support that Facebook should be investigated as a monopoly. Meta&#8217;s Hansen asked if Hemphill agreed that &#8220;The New York Post is a scandal sheet,&#8221; to which he replied that he didn&#8217;t &#8220;have a view one way or another.&#8221; Hansen showed the infamous Post <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/08/16/212560519/ny-post-axes-headless-body-in-topless-bar-headline-writer">front page headline</a>, &#8220;Headless Body in Topless Bar,&#8221; to make his point.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The exchange resurfaced years-old tensions between the press and tech titans. After experiencing relatively positive coverage during the early, aspirational days of Silicon Valley, Facebook and a handful of startups grew to become the largest platforms in the world. Along the way, they&#8217;ve chafed at increasingly critical coverage of their businesses. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Malik and Swisher have indeed both criticized Meta and its executives. In 2016, Malik critiqued Facebook&#8217;s intentions for offering free access to its apps and others in India, after board member Marc Andreesseen blamed local resistance to the program on &#8220;anti-colonialism&#8221; <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/2/11/10969300/marc-andreessen-colonialism-facebook">in a later-deleted tweet</a>. &#8220;I am suspicious of any for-profit company arguing its good intentions and its free gifts,&#8221; Malik <a href="https://om.co/2016/02/08/nothing-is-free-not-even-facebook-free-basics/">wrote at the time</a>. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">It was not the first time Meta has pointed a finger at the media while at trial</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Swisher is famous for taking tech CEOs like Zuckerberg to task in public interviews. Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.vox.com/explainers/2018/7/20/17590694/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-holocaust-denial-recode">defended platforming Holocaust deniers</a> to her in 2018, and she has <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/burn-book-kara-swisher-incendiary-takedowns-tech-titans-elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg/">called</a> him &#8220;the most damaging man in tech.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Tuesday&#8217;s exchange was not the first time that Meta has pointed a finger at the media while at trial. When discussing major scandals like <a href="/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal">Cambridge Analytica</a> from the witness stand, company leaders have chalked up downswings in user sentiment to negative media attention and testified that Meta&#8217;s services haven&#8217;t seen comparable declines in engagement. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The FTC has argued that this fact is a sign of monopoly power because people can&#8217;t leave Facebook and Instagram without viable alternatives. A judge will ultimately decide if that is true or not. In the meantime, Meta&#8217;s grudges with the press are on full display.</p></div>
