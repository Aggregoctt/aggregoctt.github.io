<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Dyson has announced what it&#8217;s claiming is the &#8220;world&#8217;s slimmest vacuum cleaner.&#8221; At first glance, its new PencilVac looks like a broom rather than a vacuum because the battery, motor, and electronics are all integrated into a thin handle that&#8217;s just 38mm in diameter &#8212; the same thickness as <a href="/news/624557/dyson-supersonic-r-professional-hairdryer-beauty-tech-availability-pricing-consumers">Dyson&#8217;s Supersonic r hair dryer</a>. It weighs in at just under four pounds and is powered by the company&#8217;s smallest and fastest vacuum motor yet.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The PencilVac is designed to be a replacement for the slim <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.com%2Fvacuum-cleaners%2Fcordless%2Fomni-glide" rel="sponsored">Dyson Omni-glide</a>, which launched in 2021 with a cleaning head that used two spinning brushes so it could suck up dust and dirt in multiple directions. The new PencilVac is not only slimmer and lighter than the Omni-glide, it uses four spinning brush bars that Dyson calls Fluffycones.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As the name implies, the Fluffycones each feature a conical design that causes long hairs to slide down to the narrow end of each brush and fall off so they can be sucked up instead of getting tangled up around the brushes. The Fluffycones slightly protrude at the sides for better edge cleaning, and are paired with green LED lights (instead of the <a href="/2021/3/24/22327796/dyson-v15-detect-vacuum-lasers-cleaning-dust-sensors">lasers that Dyson&#8217;s other vacuums use</a>) that illuminate dust and debris so you can see when floors have been properly cleaned.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Other innovations Dyson is introducing with the PencilVac include a motor that&#8217;s just 28mm in diameter but spins at 140,000RPM to generate 55AW of suction, and a new two-stage dust filtration system that prevents clogging and performance loss as the vac fills up. Given its size, the PencilVac has a smaller dust bin than Dyson&#8217;s other cleaners, but uses a new design that compresses dust as it&#8217;s removed from the airflow to help maximize how much dirt the bin can hold.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The PencilVac magnetically connects to a floor dock for charging and storage, and features a small LCD screen that shows the cleaning mode and an estimate of how long before the battery dies. It&#8217;s also Dyson&#8217;s first vacuum to connect to the MyDyson mobile app, which offers access to additional settings, alerts for when the filter needs to be cleaned, and step-by-step maintenance instructions.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The vacuum&#8217;s slim design does come with some trade-offs when compared to the company&#8217;s larger models. Its cleaning head is designed for use on hard floors, not carpeting, and while it can be swapped with alternate attachments like a furniture and crevice tool, it doesn&#8217;t convert to a shorter handheld vac. Runtime is also limited to just 30 minutes of cleaning at its lowest power setting, but its battery is swappable and Dyson will sell additional ones to extend how long you can clean.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Dyson hasn&#8217;t revealed pricing details yet, and while the PencilVac will launch in Japan later this year, it won&#8217;t be available in the US until 2026.</p></div>
