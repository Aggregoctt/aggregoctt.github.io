<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Following a <a href="/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">brief delay</a> stemming from the Trump administration&#8217;s on-again, off-again tariff policy, Nintendo officially opened up preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2. As expected, the initial rollout process at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers on April 24th <a href="/news/654571/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-issues-problems">was an absolute mess</a> &#8212; and GameStop <a href="/news/655626/nintendo-switch-2-gamestop-preorder">didn&#8217;t fare much better</a> later.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As of right now, none of the aforementioned retailers are accepting reservations for the $449 gaming console ahead of its release on June 5th. Nintendo is still <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Fhow-to-buy%2F" rel="sponsored">accepting sign-ups</a> for those looking to secure a Switch 2, though, if you do go that route, be aware that <a href="/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">there are strict requirements</a>. Nintendo also <a href="/news/655159/my-nintendo-store-switch-2-invites">can&#8217;t guarantee an invite</a> ahead of launch due to &#8220;the very high demand&#8221; for the console. Surprising, I know.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">We don&#8217;t know when the next Switch 2 preorders will open up, at least at traditional US retailers. Additional preorder inventory has popped up intermittently at select retailers in recent weeks; however, so far, none of the major retailers have announced when they will resume accepting preorders, if at all. That being said, if you&#8217;re trying to secure a Switch 2 on June 5th, both <a href="/news/665958/nintendo-switch-2-best-buy-stock-launch-day">Best Buy</a> and <a href="/news/668918/gamestop-nintendo-switch-2-stock-in-store-online-launch">GameStop</a> have confirmed that they will have limited inventory for purchase on launch day.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In the meantime, we suggest keeping an eye on the retailers below and taking a few steps to ensure you&#8217;re set up for success in the event preorders do re-open ahead of the console&#8217;s release next month.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Retailer landing pages</h2><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">What Switch 2 configurations are available?</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">At launch, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be available in two distinct configurations: a $449.99 standard version and a $499.99 bundle that includes the latest Mario Kart title, <a href="/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a>. Nintendo is <a href="/nintendo/641933/switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-limited-time-production">on record saying</a> the bundle will only be available through fall 2025 (or while supplies last), which is a shame, considering picking up the console / game combo saves you $30 on what is easily the Switch 2&#8217;s biggest launch title. If you don&#8217;t manage to secure the bundle, you&#8217;ll have to pick up Mario Kart World separately <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMario-Kart-World-U-S-Version%2F15940407280" rel="sponsored">for a whopping $79</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s also worth noting that prices could change down the line. Nintendo <a href="/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">recently raised the price</a> of the <a href="/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button">Switch 2 Joy-Cons</a> and the <a href="/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> in response to tariffs, and has said that &#8220;other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions.&#8221; The starting price of the Nintendo Switch 2 remains unchanged, but at this point, it feels like the only way to guarantee a console at $449.99 is to purchase one at launch.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">A few essentials tips to keep in mind</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If the initial preorder launch of the Switch 2 is any indication, retailers are woefully under-equipped to handle the massive influx of interest in preorders. Inventory for the Switch 2 seems to be limited despite the fact Nintendo supposedly had time to <a href="/news/645534/nintendo-switch-2-supply-demand-inventory-us-tariffs-doug-bowser">build up an inventory</a> of the next-gen system &#8220;on a global basis.&#8221; That being the case, we suggest taking a few steps to set yourself up for success in the event preorders do drop again between now and launch day.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">We&#8217;ll continue to do our best to let you know which retailers have inventory as we approach June 5th, but for now, we&#8217;ve rounded up a few helpful tips that should help you improve your chances.</p><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Create accounts for every retailer</h3><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">First things first: create accounts at Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, and other retailers if you haven&#8217;t done so already. Both Best Buy and Walmart implemented a queue system when taking Switch 2 preorders in an effort to deter scalpers &#8212; a tactic also employed during the rollout of the PlayStation 5. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s in your best interest to ensure your account is set up with the appropriate credentials. Confirm your location and delivery info, get your payment details in order, and log in to your account prior to making your purchase.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">... most retailers won&#8217;t hold your console while you&#8217;re in the checkout line</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Setting up and verifying this information in advance will help streamline the checkout process, thus allowing you to save precious seconds. This is crucial, given most retailers won&#8217;t hold your console while checking out.</p><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Download the mobile apps</h3><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you own a smartphone, we recommend downloading &#8212; and logging into &#8212; the respective retailer apps for Walmart, Amazon, GameStop, Best Buy, and Target. In the past, we&#8217;ve found that the dedicated mobile apps for various retailers are faster than using a traditional browser; they also provide an additional means of procuring a console, thus increasing your chances of securing a Switch 2 at launch.</p><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Sign up for retailer notifications</h3><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">A couple of retailers, specifically <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo%2Fpcmcat1742407305710.c%3F" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored" target="_blank">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2F424543.html" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a>, allow you to sign up for preorder updates regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, games, and accessories. So far, neither retailer has divulged much beyond what is available on their retail sites; however, they do serve as yet another opportunity to stay informed regarding how each retailer plans to handle the Switch 2 rollout going forward.</p><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Skip the accessories</h3><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Nintendo will have a raft of new accessories available for the Switch 2 at launch, including a <a href="/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a>, carrying cases, and even a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250423214048/https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">camera accessory for video chats</a>. And while it might be tempting to stack your cart with add-ons, preordering Nintendo&#8217;s first-party peripherals takes time that&#8217;s better spent on securing a console. Plus, accessory preorders don&#8217;t typically sell out nearly as fast as consoles, meaning you can always circle back for extras at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers once you&#8217;ve managed to reserve your Switch 2.</p><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Try your local brick-and-mortar store</h3><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">This might come as a surprise, but preorders aren&#8217;t only available online. A handful of retailers, including Best Buy and GameStop, opened in-store preorders for the Switch 2 following their online release. Each store has only been allocated a handful of launch units &#8212; the <a href="http://had%20been%20allotted%2044%20bundles%20and%2019%20regular%20Switch%202%20consoles">GameStop location our own Ash Parrish visited</a> had been allotted 44 bundles and 19 regular Switch 2 consoles &#8212; so it can&#8217;t hurt to ask the folks at the store nearest you if they&#8217;re still accepting preorders. The chances are slim, sure, but who knows? You might get lucky.</p><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Follow us (and others)</h3><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As you might expect, we&#8217;ll be closely monitoring Switch 2 inventory in the coming week or two &#8212; or longer if it remains unavailable following its release on June 5th. Bookmark <a href="/good-deals">our main deals hub</a>, and if you haven&#8217;t already, subscribe to <a href="/newsletters">our Verge Deals newsletter</a>! We&#8217;ll be sending special alerts as preorders become available; it&#8217;s also a great way to stay in the know regarding the latest deals and discounts, all of which come from one of our very own Verge staffers.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">A number of other social media accounts &#8212; including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250423214048/https://x.com/Wario64">Wario64</a>, <a href="https://x.com/IGNDeals/">IGN</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250423214048/https://x.com/mattswider">Matt Swider of The Shortcut</a> &#8212; are likely going to be tracking preorder inventory for the foreseeable future as well, if you&#8217;re looking for additional publications / users to follow in the run-up to launch.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Where can I get a Switch 2?</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Right now, the only confirmed retailers for the Nintendo Switch 2 are Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, Target, Newegg, Sam&#8217;s Club, and Antonline. We anticipate that Amazon will sell the console at some point, but based on previous console launches, the rollout at Amazon is likely to be sporadic and unpredictable. Either way, we&#8217;ll update this post accordingly if Amazon &#8212; or any other retailer &#8212; begins offering preorders or announces in-store availability on launch day.</p><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">My Nintendo Store</h3><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Unsurprisingly, one of the few confirmed retailers accepting reservations is the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Fhow-to-buy%2F" rel="sponsored">My Nintendo Store</a>, which comes with a string of eligibility requirements &#8212; one of which requires you to register your interest in advance. To do so, you&#8217;ll need to sign in with your Nintendo account and select the console configuration you prefer, along with any desired accessories. Then, you&#8217;ll receive an invitation email when it&#8217;s time to buy it, assuming you&#8217;ve satisfied several other conditions.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Currently, the reservation process is limited to Nintendo account holders in the US and Canada who are at least 18 years of age. Invitations are valid for 72 hours and &#8220;prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis,&#8221; according to Nintendo; you&#8217;ll also need to have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months and have logged 50 hours of gameplay on the original Switch as of April 2nd, 2025, to be eligible. What&#8217;s more, you must have opted in to share gameplay data with Nintendo (you can see if you&#8217;ve done so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250415162056/https://accounts.nintendo.com/privacy">in the privacy section</a> when logged into your account).</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9">Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account &#8230;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Once invitations have been sent to account holders who have met these criteria &#8212; a process Nintendo says is currently ongoing &#8212; invitations will be sent to &#8220;remaining eligible registrants&#8221; on a first-come, first-served basis. The invitations are nontransferable and sent to the email address you provided while registering your interest with Nintendo. Console and accessory purchases are also limited to one per eligible account, at least during the initial invitation period, which began with the first batch of invitations on May 8th.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Additional invitations are to follow periodically, though Nintendo hasn&#8217;t specified details beyond that. However, in <a href="http://Nintendo%20says%20that%20due%20to%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20very%20high%20demand" for>a recent update to its site</a>, Nintendo specified that, due to &#8220;the very high demand&#8221; for the console, &#8220;delivery by June 5 is not guaranteed&#8221; and that &#8220;your invitation email may arrive after the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.&#8221;</p><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Walmart</h3><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Walmart isn&#8217;t currently accepting preorders for the <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-System%2F15949610846%2F" rel="sponsored">standalone Switch 2</a> ($449) or the <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-Mario-Kart-World-Bundle%2F15928868255%2F" rel="sponsored">Mario Kart World bundle</a> ($499), though you can still preorder games like <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FDonkey-Kong-Bananza-U-S-Version%2F15949810208%2F" rel="sponsored">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> ($69) and accessories like the <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FJoy-Con-2-Wheel-set-of-2%2F15940757432%2F" rel="sponsored">Joy-Con Wheel Set</a> ($24.88). That being said, Walmart&#8217;s website still indicates that, if you do manage to preorder a console before 8AM ET on June 4th, you should receive it before 9AM ET on June 5th.</p><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">GameStop</h3><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">GameStop is no longer accepting preorders for the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2F424543.html" rel="sponsored">standalone console</a> or the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2-console-and-mario-kart-world-bundle%2F424542.html" rel="sponsored">Mario Kart World bundle</a>. If you&#8217;re looking to bring the cost down in the future, though, it offers up to $175 off a Switch 2 when you trade in a Switch OLED, or up to $125 off when you trade in a regular Switch. In both instances, you&#8217;ll need everything that came with your console &#8212; specifically the Switch, its dock, two working Joy-Con controllers (with wrist straps), an HDMI cable, and a power cord. GameStop also <a href="https://gizmodo.com/switch-2-buyers-hold-on-to-your-original-switch-the-resale-is-not-worth-it-2000592660">confirmed to Gizmodo</a> that the exact valuation will depend on the condition of your console, including whether your Joy-Cons are experiencing the dreaded stick drift.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you&#8217;re still looking to pick up a Switch 2 at launch, <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1923484007754498056">GameStop will have additional units</a> available both in-store and online. The retailer&#8217;s in-store launch event kicks off at 3PM local time on June 4th, with pickups starting on June 5th at 12AM EST / June 4th at 9PM PST.
