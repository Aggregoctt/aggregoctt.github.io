The upgraded version of one of our <a href="/23350899/nintendo-switch-controllers-best-wireless-joy-con-gamepad">favorite Nintendo Switch controller</a> features a few welcome improvements, including a pair of rear GL and GR buttons players can use to remap other controls. Nintendo has also finally added a 3.5mm audio jack, allowing you to pair it with a headset or a set of wired headphones. The gamepad even features the aforementioned <a href="/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">&#8220;C&#8221; button</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As of writing, you can preorder the Switch 2 Pro controller for $84.99 at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-black%2F6625904.p%3FskuId%3D6625904" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2-pro-controller%2F20021639.html" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-2-pro-controller%2F-%2FA-94704613" rel="sponsored">Target</a>.

The 1080p camera is designed to sit on a stand, allowing you to display your face as a picture-in-picture overlay or as a dedicated video feed. A few titles, such as the upgraded version of Super Mario Party Jamboree, let you see your friends on-screen while you play. Some mini-games even incorporate the camera into the game experience itself.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The camera features an adjustable wide-angle lens, designed to capture groups of people in a single shot, as well as a &#8220;high-sensitivity image sensor&#8221; that automatically adjusts brightness levels.
