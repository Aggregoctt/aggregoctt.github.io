<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Few brands are as synonymous with outdoor sports as Garmin. You&#8217;ll find these fitness trackers and smartwatches on dozens of wrists at any 5K, marathon, or Ironman. You&#8217;ll also find Garmin devotees among divers, thru-hikers, golfers, kiteboarders &#8212; you name it. But these devices aren&#8217;t just for athletes. The company&#8217;s made significant strides in its lifestyle offerings, so regardless of your fitness level, there&#8217;s a Garmin for everyone.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you&#8217;re coming from a more traditional smartwatch, Garmin&#8217;s core strengths lie in fitness, GPS, adventuring, and durability. These are hardy devices that are meant to withstand the elements and last weeks on a single charge. Several models come with offline maps, advanced navigational features, and more training metrics than any other platform. Garmin devices tend to be on the pricier side, however, and <a href="/news/636211/garmin-connect-plus-subscription-wearables">the company recently announced</a> it would begin putting its newest features behind a paywall. That&#8217;s a bummer given Garmin spent years publicly stating it had no intention of charging its users extra.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd91">What we&#8217;re looking for</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">There are fitness trackers and smartwatches, and then there are Garmins. Depending on the type of Garmin &#8212; there are many &#8212; we will tailor our benchmarks and experiential, real-life testing. If it&#8217;s a rugged Fenix model, we&#8217;ll go on extensive GPS activities, see how well it works as a navigation tool, and dive deep into training metrics. If it&#8217;s more lifestyle focused, like the Venu 3, we&#8217;ll put an added focus on how well smart features like voice assistant access, notifications, and style. Because people buy Garmins to last a long time, we also put special consideration on battery life testing. Some other factors we consider are durability, performance, ability to connect to gym equipment, and GPS accuracy.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Garmins are known for extra long battery life. The question is, does it last days, weeks, or even a month?</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Garmin has so many training features that even the pros probably don&#8217;t use all of them. Do you get coaching programs and stamina graphs? Or are you sticking to the basics like steps, pace, and mileage?</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Same goes for navigational features. While Garmin is known for its GPS tech, there are multiple kinds of GPS tracking and satellite systems. We also look at whether these navigational features fit the use case. For example, do running watches have <a href="https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/forerunner245/EN-US/GUID-CF774818-0C30-4992-962C-DDA9EA00E8C6.html#:~:text=During%20an%20activity%2C%20select%20STOP,straight%20line%2C%20select%20Straight%20Line.">back-to-start</a>? Do offline maps come preloaded for thru-hikers?</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Do these watches hold up to intense activity? Are they discreet enough to wear to formal occasions without screaming &#8220;I love exercise!!!!!&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _6jkyd95 _1xwtict1">Garmins are expensive. Does the price make sense for the intended user, feature set, and build quality?</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Garmins aren&#8217;t too shabby on smarts, either. While more fitness-focused than anything from Apple, Google, or Samsung, there&#8217;s enough to get you the basics like notifications and then some. For example, most Garmins have fall detection and safety features, and <a href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=XW4TwGAinJ2juGDNiANMt8">several of the latest Garmins</a> recently got <a href="/2023/1/24/23567610/garmin-venu-2-plus-ekg-fda">an FDA-cleared EKG feature</a>. (You&#8217;ll need a phone on hand, however, as only one Garmin model has cellular connectivity.) Many Garmin devices also support offline music playback and come with a small third-party app ecosystem.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">There are a lot of Garmin watches to choose from. No, seriously, there are six major lineups, and each has a multitude of models. But no worries &#8212; I test several Garmins every year and can help point you in the right direction.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best Garmin for runners</h2><p class="_16zyrvq1">9</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BS1T7G8S?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Garmin Forerunner 265 / 265S</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 350</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 450</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">22 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 350</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>More intuitive menu navigation</li><li>Multiband GPS</li><li>Long battery life &#8212; even with AOD enabled</li><li>Adds helpful training features</li><li>Oh, oh, it&#8217;s OLED, you know</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>It&#8217;s $100 more than the 255</li><li>OLED displays don&#8217;t cost $100</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Sizes:</strong> 42mm w/ 18mm straps; 46mm w/ 22mm straps / <strong>Weight:</strong> 39g (42mm); 47g (46mm) / <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 15 days (42mm); 13 days (46mm) in smartwatch mode / <strong>Display type:</strong> OLED touchscreen / <strong>GPS:</strong> All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> 5ATM / <strong>Music storage:</strong> 8GB</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Garmin has many running watches, and a lot of them are great. But the Forerunner 265 or 265S (if you have petite wrists) strikes an excellent balance between price, feature set, battery life, and a vibrant OLED display.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">That said, the Forerunner 265 / 265S is a bit of an odd duck. It comes a mere nine months after its predecessor, the <a href="/23171721/garmin-forerunner-255s-review-running-watch">Forerunner 255</a>, and is, in many ways, pretty much the same watch. The main difference is the 265 has an OLED display compared to the 255&#8217;s memory-in-pixel screen. Usually, that means worse battery life, but in this case, we got about a week on a single charge with the always-on display enabled. Without it, you can get up to 15 days. Given that OLED is easier to read and just, well, looks nicer, that gives the 265 lineup an edge over the 255.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The 265 also has dual-frequency GPS (also known as multi-band). The gist is you get much more accurate maps in challenging environments like cities and dense forests because you can access both the L1 and L5 satellite frequencies. And even with dual-frequency GPS enabled, you still don&#8217;t lose a whole lot of battery life. I wore it during a half marathon with that and the AOD enabled, and I still had over 80 percent battery by the time I got home. This is also an excellent price, as the majority of multi-band GPS watches cost well over $600.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">My main complaint is that $450, while not bad for Garmin, is still a lot when you consider that&#8217;s the same price as smarter smartwatches with great running features. Some runners won&#8217;t care. But if you&#8217;re on a budget &#8212; or you&#8217;re new to running and feel iffy about spending that much &#8212; then consider the <a href="/24107020/garmin-forerunner-165-music-review-smartwatch-wearables">Forerunner 165</a> series. It starts at $250 (add another $50 for onboard music) and does almost everything the 265 series does. The main things you&#8217;re missing are dual-frequency GPS and a few more niche sport profiles. But if you&#8217;re mostly sticking to running, gym equipment, cycling, swimming, and hiking, you&#8217;re covered.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Smartwatch-Colorful-Whitestone/dp/B0CWB5JPSS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Garmin Forerunner 165 Music</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 250</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 300</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">17 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 250</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">The Garmin Forerunner 165 Music gets you in-depth training metrics but leaves out some of the more advanced features in exchange for a more palatable price.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Neither has all of Garmin&#8217;s training features, but it&#8217;s got what you&#8217;ll need to run anything from a 5K to a full marathon. That includes a Race Predictor, which gives you an estimate of what your best time would be based on your actual training. You can also use PacePro to figure out your pacing strategy for a race. You also get Garmin&#8217;s Training Readiness feature to help gauge load and recovery, Garmin Coach plans, and a host of running form metrics. It also supports offline music and safety features like fall detection. The only thing they lack is advanced mapping. (They still have trackback, point-to-point navigation, and real-time breadcrumb trail support, however.)</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best Garmin for endurance sports</h2><p class="_16zyrvq1">8</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BYFCX667?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Garmin Epix Pro Sapphire Edition (42mm)</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 890</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 1000</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">11 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 890</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Now comes in multiple sizes</li><li>Hands-free flashlight is SO handy</li><li>Great battery life</li><li>Multiband GPS</li><li>Upgraded heart rate sensor</li><li>Starting price hasn&#8217;t changed</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>AOD zaps battery life to three to four days</li><li>Lots of incremental changes</li><li>It&#8217;s a Garmin review, so once again, the app</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Sizes:</strong> 42mm w/ 20mm straps; 47mm w/ 22mm straps; 51mm w/ 26mm straps / <strong>Weight:</strong> 42mm: 63g stainless steel, 58g titanium; 47mm: 78g stainless steel, 70g titanium; 51mm: 98g stainless steel, 88g titanium / <strong>Battery life: </strong>42mm: up to 10 days (4 with AOD); 47mm: up to 16 days (6 with AOD); 51mm: up to 31 days (11 with AOD) / <strong>Display type:</strong> OLED / <strong>GPS:</strong> All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> 10ATM / <strong>Music storage:</strong> Up to 32GB</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <a href="/23759824/garmin-epix-2-pro-review-smartwatch">Epix Pro</a> will get you every fitness feature that Garmin has to offer. And I mean everything. It would frankly be easier to tell you what the Epix Pro does not have: things that are limited to LTE smartwatches and some of the new smart features on the Fenix 8, like an on-board voice assistant. Otherwise, you&#8217;ve got topographical maps, turn-by-turn navigation, and more training metrics than even a seasoned triathlete would know what to do with.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Pro is more size-inclusive than the <a href="/22934516/garmin-epix-2-review">standard second-gen Epix</a>, which only comes in 47mm. You can get the Pro in that size, too, but it also comes in 42mm and 51mm. This was a major complaint I had with the second-gen Epix, and you love to see companies actually take this sort of thing seriously. The best part is the Pro models start at the same price as the regular Epix did. You&#8217;ll have to pay $100 extra for materials like titanium and sapphire crystal, but that&#8217;s also true of the standard Epix.</p><p class="_16zyrvq1">7</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-f%25C4%2593nix%25C2%25AE-Multisport-Long-Lasting-Built/dp/B0DC6ZD321?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Garmin Fenix 8</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 800</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 1000</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">20 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 800</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Smartens up Garmin&#8217;s flagship multisport watch</li><li>Excellent battery and fitness tracking</li><li>Offers MIP and OLED display options</li><li>Condenses the Fenix and Epix lines into one</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>The starting price is $350 more than the Fenix 7!</li><li>Smart features are less helpful without LTE</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">That said, it muddies the waters if you&#8217;re trying to pick between the Epix Pro, <a href="/22937154/garmin-fenix-7s-review-fitness-tracker-smartwatch">Fenix 7</a>, <a href="/23809801/garmin-fenix-7s-pro-review-smartwatch-wearables">Fenix 7 Pro</a>, and now, the <a href="/24266434/garmin-fenix-8-review-smartwatch-wearables-fitness-tracking">Fenix 8</a>. The main difference is the Epix watches all have OLED displays. One reason I prefer OLED is that they&#8217;re much easier to read indoors &#8212; where most of us spend the majority of our time. The Fenix 7 series&#8217; memory-in-pixel displays (plus solar charging if you opt for it) allow for weeks and weeks of charge, but the smallest Epix Pro can get around 10 days with normal usage. The 47mm and 51mm Pro models can go longer between charges due to bigger batteries, but I felt that the 42mm has enough juice to satisfy most use cases. Garmin also has so many battery-saving modes and options that I highly doubt this will ever be an issue.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Not helping matters is the fact that the Fenix 8 lets you choose between an OLED or a MIP display. You also get smart features like an onboard voice assistant, the ability to take calls from the wrist, and the Garmin Messenger app. The main problem is the starting price is now $350 more than the standard Fenix 7 and right about on par with the Epix Pro. My personal feeling is the Fenix 8&#8217;s smart features are just okay and that you&#8217;re really not missing much by not having them. We also often see discounts on older models, so I would put on my bargain-hunting hat for a discounted Epix Pro or Fenix 7 Pro while inventory is still available.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But really, the winning feature of the Epix Pro is the hands-free flashlight. It&#8217;s so useful in my day-to-day life, and all you have to do is double-press a button. It&#8217;s as bright as your smartphone, comes with a red light option if you want something easier on the eyes, and can act as a strobe in an emergency situation. The Fenix 7 Pro and 8 watches also have a flashlight, so a lot of this is going to come down to personal preference for the display, price, and whether you care about smart features.</p><p class="_16zyrvq1">8</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Multisport-Smartwatch-Flashlight-Capability/dp/B0BYFDZ6BM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Garmin Fenix 7S Pro</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 679</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 900</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">25 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 679</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Hands-free flashlight</li><li>Long battery life</li><li>Multiband GPS</li><li>Upgraded heart rate monitor</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>The improved MIP display is still not the easiest to read in dim lighting</li><li>Too similar to the standard Fenix 7</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you&#8217;re set on the most battery life possible, I recommend the Fenix 7 Pro over the standard 7 for a few reasons. Its MIP display is slightly brighter, all sizes have the flashlight, and, like the Epix Pro, it has an updated sensor array. I also recommend it over the MIP versions of the Fenix 8 because it comes in more sizes, and costs around $300 less. Especially since the Fenix 8&#8217;s smart features are a bit half-baked.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best Garmin on a budget</h2><p class="_16zyrvq1">8</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LRHF75R/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Garmin Vivomove Sport</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 164</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 178</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">8 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 164</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Aesthetically pleasing and accurate tracking</li><li>Good for smaller wrists</li><li>Affordable price</li><li>The hidden OLED is cool</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>The Garmin app is overly complicated</li><li>Battery life is shorter than other hybrids</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Sizes:</strong> 40mm w/ 20mm straps / <strong>Weight:</strong> 19g / <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 5 days / <strong>Display type:</strong> &#8220;Hidden&#8221; OLED touchscreen / <strong>GPS:</strong> Tethered GPS / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, Ant Plus / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> 5ATM / <strong>Music storage:</strong> N/A</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">What I love most about the Vivomove Sport is that it doesn&#8217;t look like what most people expect from a Garmin. It&#8217;s a hybrid smartwatch, which means it looks like a regular watch but can track fitness and deliver notifications. Garmin&#8217;s hybrids are also unique in that they all use an OLED display that stays hidden until you need it.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">This is best suited for a casually active person who wants style and value in a lightweight package. Think wellness, more so than fitness. It gets you continuous heart rate monitoring and blood oxygen level monitoring, and can even provide abnormal heart rate alerts. You also get access to more in-depth metrics like respiration rate, fitness age, stress, and Body Battery, which is Garmin&#8217;s tool for visualizing how well-rested you are. For smart features, you get all the basics, like notifications, alarms, and timers.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Sport isn&#8217;t quite as full-featured as some other Garmin watches you&#8217;ll find on this list. For instance, you&#8217;re giving up built-in GPS in favor of tethered GPS through your phone. There are no contactless payments, nor is there a microphone or speaker for taking calls on the wrist. But this is a budget pick, and you get a lot, considering this is an entry-level gadget that could pass for a Swatch at a glance.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I don&#8217;t love that the battery life is short for a hybrid, at around three to four days. Even so, that&#8217;s still much better than what you&#8217;ll get on an Apple Watch or Wear OS 4 watch. If you&#8217;re willing to spend about $100 more, the $269.99 <a href="/23600040/garmin-vivomove-trend-review-hybrid-smartwatch-wearable">Vivomove Trend</a> has more chic materials, gets you more screen real estate, and wireless Qi charging. Otherwise, this is a great lifestyle wearable that can serve as a classier alternative to your typical fitness band.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CP9BFHFB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Garmin Lily 2</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 200</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 250</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">20 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 200</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">The Garmin Lily 2 is a simple yet chic hybrid analog smartwatch that delivers basic fitness tracking, notifications, and up to five days of battery life.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you prefer something newer to the Sport that&#8217;s also stylish, the <a href="/24152258/garmin-lily-2-fitness-tracker-wearable-smartwatch">Garmin Lily 2</a> is another good option, especially if you&#8217;ve got particularly small wrists or prefer something extremely lightweight. The swipe and tap gestures are still a little fiddly to use &#8212; which was also the case with the first-gen model &#8212; but the fresh design is <a href="/24152258/garmin-lily-2-fitness-tracker-wearable-smartwatch">a fun way to lightly monitor your fitness</a> without bogging yourself down with notifications. Garmin also offers the <a href="/2024/10/2/24260540/garmin-lily-2-active-smartwatch-fitness-tracker">Lily 2 Active</a>, which adds a physical button, GPS, and support for more sports tracking for a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Stylish-Smartwatch-Patterned-Silicone/dp/B0DGVV6T6H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">starting price of $299.99</a>.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best Garmin to replace a Fitbit</h2><p class="_16zyrvq1">8</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5VVNJBF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Garmin Venu Sq 2</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 194</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 250</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">22 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 194</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Bright display</li><li>Long battery life</li><li>Tons of training and health features</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>Cluttered app</li><li>Proprietary USB-A charger</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Sizes:</strong> 40mm w/ 20mm straps / <strong>Weight:</strong> 38g / <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 11 days / <strong>Display type:</strong> OLED touchscreen / <strong>GPS:</strong> All-systems GNSS / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, Ant Plus / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> 5ATM / <strong>Music storage:</strong> 4GB (for Music Edition)</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you were disappointed by the <a href="/23392564/fitbit-sense-2-review-google-fitness-tracker">Fitbit Sense 2</a> and <a href="/2022/8/24/23318381/fitbit-versa-4-sense-2-inspire-3-price-features">Versa 4</a>, the Venu Sq 2 is the next best thing (and, in some ways, better).</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">At a glance, the Venu Sq 2 could easily be mistaken for an Apple Watch. On the wrist, you&#8217;ll notice it&#8217;s made of plastic, but it still looks quite chic and extremely lightweight. The screen is bright, easy to read, and looks better than any Versa or Sense ever did.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The feature set is also great for the price, with built-in GPS, a ton of watch faces, emergency safety features, and contactless payments. If you pay $50 more for the Music Edition, you&#8217;ll also get about 500 songs worth of storage, but we wouldn&#8217;t recommend it. This doesn&#8217;t have cellular connectivity and, therefore, isn&#8217;t truly standalone. You&#8217;ll most likely be carrying your phone with you anyway.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As for health features, the Venu Sq 2 basically has everything you&#8217;d get on a Versa or Sense smartwatch but with Garmin&#8217;s treasure trove of metrics as well. That includes heart rate tracking, blood oxygen tracking, intensity minutes (how much moderate exercise you get in a week), stress tracking, hydration tracking, respiratory rate, period tracking, and Garmin&#8217;s recovery feature, Body Battery. As far as fitness goes, you also get access to Garmin Coach, which provides free 5K, 10K, and half marathon training plans. You love to see it.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Another big leg-up Garmin has over Fitbit? None of these features or metrics are locked behind a paywall, even if Garmin&#8217;s AI-powered insights and a few other expanded features will only be available as part of Garmin Connect Plus ($6.99 a month / $69.99 annually).</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best Garmin smartwatch</h2><p class="_16zyrvq1">7</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CDC6Y617/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Garmin Venu 3S</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 350</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 450</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">22 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 350</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Good battery life</li><li>Better sleep tracking and nap detection</li><li>EKG and AFib features</li><li>Can take calls and use your phone&#8217;s voice assistant</li><li>Audio meditation sessions done well</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>Pricey compared to other lifestyle smartwatches</li><li>Limited third-party app ecosystem</li><li>No LTE capability</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Sizes:</strong> 41mm w/ 18mm straps; 45mm w/ 22mm straps / <strong>Weight:</strong> 40g for the 3S; 47g for the 3 / <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 10 days for 3S; 14 days for 3 / <strong>Display type:</strong> OLED touchscreen / <strong>GPS:</strong> GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> 5ATM / <strong>Music storage:</strong> 8GB</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Garmin has shored up the smarts in its watches over the past several years, and the Venu 3 series is the smartest (and most affordable) of the bunch.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Venu 3 series comes in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. Like the <a href="/2022/1/4/22859098/garmin-venu-2-plus-vivomove-sport-smartwatches">Venu 2 Plus</a>, it has a microphone and speaker. You can take calls directly from the wrist and issue commands to your phone&#8217;s digital assistant via Bluetooth. It&#8217;s not the same as having Siri, Bixby, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant built directly into the watch, but it&#8217;s a clever workaround that works well for hands-free control. It also supports safety features like fall detection and live tracking, as well as contactless payments.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Like other OLED Garmins, the display is both vibrant and easy to read. As for health and fitness, you get a nice mix of basic and more advanced features and metrics. It has Garmin&#8217;s latest heart rate sensor, which enables FDA-cleared EKG and AFib detection features. Overall, it leans a bit more on the wellness and health side of things, with intensity minutes, blood oxygen monitoring, sleep tracking, period tracking, abnormal heart rate alerts, and stress tracking. As for training, you still get built-in GPS, VO2 Max, heart rate zones, respiration rate, and downloadable training plans via Garmin Coach.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">New to the 3 and 3S is a sleep coach that factors in metrics like heart rate variability and recent activity to determine your sleep needs. It also finally adds nap detection, a feature that&#8217;s been long overdue for the Garmin platform. The Venu 3 series also adds audio-guided meditation sessions, and you can view how these sessions directly impact your metrics. From an accessibility standpoint, this also adds a new wheelchair mode.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Technically, the new Fenix 8 is slightly smarter in that it adds an on-board voice assistant. However, it is also more than double the price and not what I&#8217;d consider a good value for the average athlete. It&#8217;s more for people who spend hours upon hours training every week.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">This is the Garmin for you if you want the platform&#8217;s in-depth training without sacrificing the productivity of a smartwatch. The main things it&#8217;s lacking are cellular options and a robust third-party app ecosystem. That said, it&#8217;s got Spotify, Amazon Music, and Deezer for offline listening. It&#8217;s also a good option if you&#8217;re fed up with MIP displays and want a smarter Garmin rather than a full-on smartwatch.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">What&#8217;s coming next</h2><ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1ymtmqpi _11h7yix0 _1xwtict1"><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Earlier this month, Garmin announced a new midrange option, the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1463821/" rel="sponsored">$549.99 <strong>Garmin Forerunner 570</strong></a>, which will be available to order starting on May 21st. The new wearable boasts an OLED display and lets you take calls from your wrist thanks to a built-in speaker and microphone; it will also be available in both 42mm and 47mm sizes, features skin temperature sensors, and can estimate how much sleep you need. <a href="/hands-on/667677/garmin-forerunner-970-and-570-specs-price-battery">Read our hands-on impressions.</a></span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Garmin has also recently announced the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1462801/pn/010-02969-00/" rel="sponsored"><strong>Garmin</strong> <strong>Forerunner 970</strong></a>, the successor to the <a href="/2023/3/2/23620442/garmin-smartwatch-forerunner-265-965-oled-wearable">Forerunner 965</a>, which will be available on May 21st. The 47mm 970 features a more durable build than the 570, along with an LED flashlight and support for Garmin&#8217;s EKG app for atrial fibrillation detection. The $749.99 running watch also introduces offline maps and three advanced running metrics: running tolerance, running economy, and step speed loss. The first metric is designed to help runners train more efficiently by recommending when to increase or dial back mileage to avoid injury, while the latter two are meant to track energy levels after multiple runs and analyze how much a runner slows down with each foot strike. That being said, to take advantage of the latter two metrics, you&#8217;ll have to buy the new $169.99 HRM 600 chest strap, which will also be available on May 21st. <a href="/hands-on/667677/garmin-forerunner-970-and-570-specs-price-battery">Read our hands-on impressions.</a></span></li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Update, May 19th: </strong>Adjusted pricing / availability and added a mention of both the Garmin Forerunner 970 and the forthcoming Forerunner 570.</p></div>
