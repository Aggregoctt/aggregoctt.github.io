<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google&#8217;s second era of smart glasses is off to a chic start. At its I/O developer conference today, Google announced that it&#8217;ll be partnering with Samsung, Gentle Monster, and Warby Parker to create smart glasses that people will actually want to wear.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The partnership hints that Google is taking style a lot more seriously this time around. Warby Parker is well known as a direct-to-consumer eyewear brand that makes it easy to get trendy glasses at a relatively accessible price. Meanwhile, Gentle Monster is <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/gentle-monster-eyewear-trend/">currently one of the buzziest eyewear brands</a> that isn&#8217;t owned by EssilorLuxottica. The Korean brand is popular among Gen Z, thanks in part to its edgy silhouettes and the fact that Gentle Monster is favored by fashion-forward celebrities like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CmtMi8NrUXt/">Kendrick Lamar</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gentlemonster/p/CicQlcSJOU8/?img_index=1">Beyonc&#233;</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BdAZBNbl7di/?hl=en">Rihanna</a>, <a href="https://graziamagazine.com/articles/gigi-hadid-loves-gentle-monster-sunglasses/">Gigi Hadid</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3UAljrljhl/">Billie Eilish</a>. Partnering with both brands seems to hint that Android XR is aimed at both versatile, everyday glasses as well as bolder, trendsetting options.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The other thing to note is that Google seems to be leaning on Samsung for XR glasses hardware, too. As part of a Keyword blog, Google&#8217;s VP of XR, Shahram Izadi, noted that it&#8217;s &#8220;advancing its partnership with Samsung to go beyond headsets&#8221; and into glasses. Also announced today at I/O, Google noted the first pair of Android XR-enabled glasses will be made by Xreal under the name <a href="/e/669338">Project Aura</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As for what these XR glasses will be able to do, Google was keen to emphasize that they&#8217;re a great vehicle for using Gemini. So far, Google&#8217;s prototype glasses have had cameras, microphones, and speakers so that its AI assistant can help you interpret the world around you. That included demos of taking photos, getting turn-by-turn directions, and live language translation. That pretty much lines up with what I saw at <a href="/2024/12/12/24319528/google-android-xr-samsung-project-moohan-smart-glasses">my Android XR hands-on</a> in December, but Google has slowly been rolling out these demos more publicly over the past few months.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Altogether, it seems like Google is directly taking a page out of Meta&#8217;s smart glasses playbook. That&#8217;s a big deal, as it&#8217;s a direct nod to the success Meta&#8217;s had with its Ray-Ban smart glasses. The company revealed in February that it&#8217;s already <a href="/news/613292/meta-ray-ban-2-million-10-million-capacity-subscription-essilor-luxottica-earnings">sold 2 million pairs of its Ray-Ban smart glasses</a> and has been vocally positioning them as the ideal hardware for AI assistants.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The latter remains to be seen, but one thing the Ray-Ban Meta glasses have convincingly argued is that <a href="/2023/9/30/23894067/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-style-wearables">for smart glasses to go mainstream, they need to look cool.</a> Not only do Meta&#8217;s glasses look like an ordinary pair of Ray-Bans, Ray-Ban itself is an iconic brand known for its Wayfarer shape. In other words, they&#8217;re glasses the average person wouldn&#8217;t feel quite so put off wearing. Since launching its second-gen smart glasses in late 2023, Meta has also put out a few limited edition versions, playing into the same fashion strategy as sneakers. Meta is also rumored to be releasing <a href="/2025/1/21/24348949/metas-next-smart-glasses-may-be-with-oakley">Oakley-branded versions of its smart glasses for athletes</a>.</p></div>
