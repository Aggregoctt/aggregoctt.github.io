<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">WizKids did <a href="/2023/9/5/23860060/baldurs-gate-3-news-reviews-updates">Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3</a> dirty with its new D&amp;D Icons of the Realms collection of miniature figures. The anticipated collection based on the beloved RPG (my personal 2023 GOTY) launched in April, and some buyers noticed that the characters look nothing &#8212; and I mean nothing &#8212; like how they were advertised. These cursed recreations of Shadowheart, Astarion, Karlach, Gale, Wyll, and Lae&#8217;zel look like unlicensed knockoffs when they are, in fact, officially licensed by Wizards of the Coast. And, it costs $50 for the set!</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Anyone who has played the game, or at least seen its cover art numerous times, knows what these characters should look like. They don&#8217;t look like 3D-printed discards predestined for the garbage bin, with little to no effort made to look authentic, unless perhaps you&#8217;re squinting from 10 feet away.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In response to buyers posting pictures of the botched figures on social media and retail sites, and likely from <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3-companions-got-official-usd50-d-and-d-minis-and-i-am-casting-vicious-mockery-because-what-in-the-nine-hells-is-this/">GamesRadar</a> and other sites posting about it last week, <a href="https://wizkids.com/recent-announcements-2/baldurs-gate-3-character-boxed-set-update/">WizKids posted an apology</a> to buyers &#8212; and to Wizards of the Coast. In it, it details how to get a refund or a replacement to anyone who bought them online or at a local games store. Keep them, replace them, destroy them, pray to them. It&#8217;s up to you.</p></div>
