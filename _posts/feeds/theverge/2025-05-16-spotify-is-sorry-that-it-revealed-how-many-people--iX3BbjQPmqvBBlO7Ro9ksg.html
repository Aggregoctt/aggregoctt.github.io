<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Spotify announced earlier this month that podcast creators and listeners would get a new data point: how many plays an episode has gotten. The idea, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/spotify-now-shows-how-many-times-people-listened-to-podcast-episodes/">according to Spotify</a>, was that listeners could discover new shows they hadn&#8217;t heard of, enticed by this new public measure of fandom.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Since the announcement, podcasters, especially those with smaller audiences, have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/spotify-plays-feature-smaller-podcasters-worried-rcna205651?utm_source=podnews.net&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=podnews.net:2025-05-12">been upset at the new public play count</a>. The chief complaint was that some podcasters actually don&#8217;t want listeners to know how many people are listening to their podcast, because it might have the opposite effect: it could turn people off to know a show only has a few dozen plays. Some Spotify users in <a href="https://www.threads.com/@spotifyforcreators/post/DJW2azHg68C">the chorus of opposition</a> also noted that plays would only show a slice of listenership, since people use platforms besides Spotify.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The sustained backlash evidently hit a nerve: on Friday, Spotify announced it was partially rolling back the feature. Now it will only publicly display plays once an episode <a href="https://creators.spotify.com/resources/news/plays-on-spotify">crosses the 50,000 plays threshold</a>. When an episode hits that benchmark, it will get a &#8220;50K plays&#8221; marker instead of an exact count; the marker will update when an episode crosses other milestones, like 100,000 and 1 million plays. Podcasters will still be able to see exact play counts in their private analytics dashboards &#8212; but will be spared the embarrassment of having those figures broadcast publicly. The company is also vague about <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/creators/article/how-we-count-engagement-metrics/">how exactly plays are counted</a>, saying only that the metric represents &#8220;how many times people actively tried your content.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Podcasting historically has been hard to quantify: a download doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean a listen. There are <a href="/news/667905/youtube-weekly-podcast-chart-joe-rogan">public charts</a>, but those tend to favor the biggest shows. Across mediums, there&#8217;s the awkward growing stage for content creators just starting out: you have to post as if you have a million followers even if it&#8217;s just for your 10 actual fans. Is displaying podcast plays something nobody asked for? Absolutely. But also, the jokes write themselves, unfortunately.</p></div>
