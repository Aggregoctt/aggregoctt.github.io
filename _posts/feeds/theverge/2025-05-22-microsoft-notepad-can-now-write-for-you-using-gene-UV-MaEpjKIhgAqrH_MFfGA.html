<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft is now testing a new feature in Notepad that can generate text for you using AI. It&#8217;s part of a Windows 11 update being released to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev channels with Copilot Plus PCs. The update also includes new AI-powered features for Paint like a sticker generator, and improvements to the Snipping Tool that can automatically crop and resize screenshots based on what you&#8217;re selecting.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Notepad&#8217;s new Write feature can be used to &#8220;quickly draft text based on your prompt,&#8221; <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/05/22/paint-snipping-tool-and-notepad-updates-with-new-features-begin-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/">according to the Windows Insider Blog</a>, &#8220;or build upon existing content with AI-powered assistance.&#8221; You can either right-click where you want new text to be inserted in a document or after selecting existing text you want to use as a reference.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">After selecting the new Write feature in Windows&#8217; Copilot menu, a prompt will appear where instructions can be entered. The AI-generated output will appear in the document but you&#8217;ll have the option to keep it, discard it if it&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re looking for, or refine the output by entering follow-up prompts. The feature was <a href="/2024/1/9/24032117/microsoft-windows-notepad-generative-ai-option">first discovered earlier this year</a> in code included in test builds of Windows 11.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Write follows two other AI-powered tools <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enhance-your-writing-with-ai-in-notepad-4088b954-c97b-46dc-813f-959be01746d5?preview=true">Microsoft has been testing with Notepad</a>. <a href="/news/629412/windows-11-notepad-ai-summaries-snipping-tool">Summarize</a>, first introduced last March, can generate a summary of the text in a document while <a href="/2024/11/6/24289707/microsoft-notepad-ai-text-editing-rewrite">Rewrite</a>, which began testing last November, can adjust the tone of text, shorten or lengthen it, and rephrase sentences.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Joining AI features already being tested in Microsoft Paint like Generative Fill, Generative Erase, and the Cocreator tool that can create images based on text prompts and reference sketches, is a new Sticker generator. A new button in the Copilot menu opens a prompt where you can describe the sticker you want to create. Paint will then generate a small set of stickers based on your description that can be added to your canvas or copied over to other applications.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Paint is also getting a new Object select tool that relies on AI to create smart selections that takes most of the grunt work out of isolating and manipulating specific elements in a photo or painting.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">To potentially make it easier to screenshot exactly what you need and immediately share it without edits, Windows 11&#8217;s Snipping Tool is gaining a new Perfect screenshot button on its toolbar. When framing a screenshot using the rectangle tool Perfect screenshot will use AI to &#8220;intelligently resize based on the content in your selection,&#8221; but you&#8217;ll still have the option to resize or reposition the selected region of your screen before capturing it.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s being joined by a new Color picker in the Snipping tool that lets you see the HEX, RGB or HSL color values below an eyedropper cursor, and it can be zoomed for more precision by either scrolling or using Ctrl +/- keyboard shortcuts.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">You&#8217;ll need to be signed into your Microsoft account to use Notepad&#8217;s new Write feature which will use the <a href="/2025/1/16/24345051/microsoft-365-personal-family-copilot-office-ai-price-rises">same credits system as other AI-powered Windows 11 features do</a>. Microsoft hasn&#8217;t yet announced what pricing for these credits will be if it eventually starts charging for them.</p></div>
