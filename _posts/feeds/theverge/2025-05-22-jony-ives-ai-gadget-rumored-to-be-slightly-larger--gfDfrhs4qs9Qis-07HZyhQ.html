<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">More details are trickling out about Jony Ive and Sam Altman&#8217;s new AI device. In <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1925543472993321066">a post on Thursday,</a> Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says his research indicates that the device could be larger than Humane&#8217;s AI pin, but with a &#8220;form factor as compact and elegant as an iPod Shuffle.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Kuo adds that &#8220;one of the intended use cases&#8221; is wearing the device around your neck. It also may not come with a display, Kuo says, featuring just built-in cameras and microphones for &#8220;environmental detection.&#8221; The device could also connect to smartphones and PCs to use their computing and display capabilities.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">This latest leak aligns with <a href="/news/672357/openai-ai-device-sam-altman-jony-ive">a report from The Wall Street Journal</a>, which says the device will be aware of a user&#8217;s life and surroundings, but probably won&#8217;t be a pair of glasses. On Wednesday, <a href="/news/671838/openai-jony-ive-ai-hardware-apple">Altman revealed that OpenAI</a> is buying Ive&#8217;s AI hardware company, io, for $6.5 billion, which will &#8220;take over design for all of OpenAI, including its software.&#8221; Ive and Altman are aiming to launch their first devices in 2026.</p></div>
