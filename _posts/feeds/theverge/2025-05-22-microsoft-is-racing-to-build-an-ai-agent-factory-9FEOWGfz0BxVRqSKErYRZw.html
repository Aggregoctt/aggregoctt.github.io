<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">When Microsoft CEO <strong>Satya Nadella</strong> ran into Meta&#8217;s former engineering chief, <strong>Jay Parikh</strong>, at a conference last summer, he had the future of AI top of mind. The pair have known each other for around 15 years, but this meeting was different, and Nadella called Parikh shortly after bumping into him to dig into what was really on his mind.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;We were chatting about the future and chatting about all the stuff he needs to do here and that the team needs to do around AI,&#8221; Parikh, now head of Microsoft&#8217;s CoreAI team, tells The Verge. &#8220;That&#8217;s when he said, &#8216;Hey, why don&#8217;t you come join and help me transform the company around all of this AI stuff?&#8217;&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Nadella regularly talks about Microsoft being part of a new AI era, but he now wants the company to overhaul how it builds software to meet this new era head-on. Parikh, who transformed Facebook engineering teams, now leads a transformation that he describes as building an AI &#8220;agent factory&#8221; for Microsoft&#8217;s customers.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8221;I described this agent factory idea to Bill [Gates], not knowing that he and Paul [Allen] described Microsoft 50 years ago as the software factory,&#8221; Parikh says. &#8220;Just like how Bill had this idea of Microsoft being a bunch of software developers building a bunch of software, I want our platform, for any enterprise or any organization, to be able to be the thing they turn into their own agent factory.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In essence, this idea of an AI agent factory is Microsoft&#8217;s way of redefining its platform that businesses around the world already rely on and finding a coherent way to leverage the best bits of GitHub, Copilot, Azure AI Foundry, and even Azure to let businesses &#8220;build their own factory to build agents,&#8221; Parikh says.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Parikh has only been at Microsoft for a <a href="/2025/1/17/24345865/microsoft-ai-announcements-2025-notepad">little over six months</a>, but the company is already moving at pace toward this agent factory goal. &#8220;We have rewired some of the ways we do product development here, to support this vision of building the products and platform that we do in this agent factory mode,&#8221; he says.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Parikh has also been pushing some of his team, many of whom are the core developer division of Microsoft, to adopt AI and get ready for this transformation that he&#8217;s now in charge of. I&#8217;ve heard he regularly sends an email missive about AI to his team, sometimes even on a Saturday morning. He&#8217;s described himself in the past as having a &#8220;quiet intensity,&#8221; where he&#8217;ll listen to lots of opinions and then push teams to a particular goal with that learned knowledge. This experience has led him to oversee a variety of projects in the past, including Meta&#8217;s experimental solar-powered drone project to provide internet to remote locations and some of the key engineering at Akamai that kept the world&#8217;s biggest websites online. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Pushing Microsoft&#8217;s developers to build technology that could eventually replace their previous coding efforts might just be his greatest challenge yet. Not only will Parikh have to convince his team of this change, but Microsoft also needs to convince businesses that its vision of AI agents isn&#8217;t just another chatbot idea that, outside of ChatGPT, hasn&#8217;t really produced results.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;In the last couple of years, we were looking at mostly chatbots with AI&#8230; everyone was clamoring for where&#8217;s the ROI? And frankly there was no ROI, that was people dipping their toes in the water and understanding what was there,&#8221; Parikh says. &#8220;Now, people are moving on from that and the models are super super advanced, compared to even a year ago.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Parikh envisions a future where app developers start with AI first. &#8220;Instead of duct-taping a little AI to an existing app, what we want the platform to support is you start with the model, then you leverage the scaffolding that&#8217;s there in the platform.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft isn&#8217;t alone in this AI agent push. Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and many others are racing toward this idea of AI agents controlling parts of our digital life or automating the tasks at work that we&#8217;d rather not have to do. OpenAI, Microsoft&#8217;s key partner in its AI efforts, is also building its own platform that could easily compete with Microsoft&#8217;s work.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;We want to be people&#8217;s core AI subscription,&#8221; OpenAI CEO <strong>Sam Altman said</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctcMA6chfDY">in a recent interview</a>. &#8220;Some of that will be what you do inside ChatGPT, we&#8217;ll have a couple of other key parts of that subscription. But mostly we will hopefully build this smarter and smarter model and have these surfaces like future devices and future things that are sort of similar to operating systems.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">That sounds like OpenAI could certainly compete with Microsoft&#8217;s various platforms and hardware, particularly as the AI lab just <a href="/news/671838/openai-jony-ive-ai-hardware-apple">acquired Jony Ive&#8217;s AI startup</a> in a nearly $6.5 billion deal that could shake up the nascent AI hardware market and really bring these AI agents to life. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It certainly feels like everyone in tech is now racing toward a similar goal of owning what they believe to be the next wave of computing. It&#8217;s fast-paced, ever changing, and the future of who wins is uncertain, but Microsoft seems determined to meet the moment, even <a href="/news/669298/microsoft-windows-ai-foundry-mcp-support">embracing the open-source Model Context Protocol</a> as part of a push to reshape Windows in a world of AI agents.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;We just have to learn the fastest. If we&#8217;re learning the fastest out of everybody out there, I feel confident that we&#8217;ll deliver great value to our customers and hone into our craft of these products working well,&#8221; says Parikh. &#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got to do. It&#8217;s exciting and it&#8217;s not for the faint of heart.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Note: I interviewed Parikh ahead of a Palestinian tech worker interrupting his keynote at Build earlier this week, when the company was still refusing to comment on its cloud and AI contracts with the Israeli government. Microsoft eventually issued a statement a few days after my interview.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Microsoft Build overshadowed by protests and Musk</strong></h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft held its Build developer conference in Seattle this week, and while the news wasn&#8217;t earth-shattering this year, it was certainly an eventful week. Top announcements included <a href="/web/669437/nlweb-microsoft-ai-agents-open-web">Microsoft&#8217;s plan to fix the web</a> by letting websites run AI search for cheap, Windows <a href="/news/669298/microsoft-windows-ai-foundry-mcp-support">getting native MCP support</a>, and the <a href="/news/669286/microsoft-windows-subsystem-for-linux-open-source">surprise open-sourcing</a> of the Windows Subsystem for Linux.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Outside of that, this year&#8217;s Microsoft Build will, for many, be remembered more for protests and the surprise appearance of <strong>Elon Musk</strong>. Alongside the more than 6,000 layoffs at Microsoft earlier this month, a lot of employees I&#8217;ve spoken to recently are feeling anxious about the direction Microsoft is taking.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">On Monday, j<a href="/news/669362/microsoft-employee-protest-build-conference-satya-nadella">ust minutes after Satya Nadella began</a> delivering the opening keynote, Microsoft employee <strong>Joe Lopez</strong> yelled, &#8220;How about you show how Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?&#8221; Moments later, Lopez sent an email to thousands of Microsoft employees. He was fired later that day.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The keynote on Build&#8217;s second day was also interrupted, this time by a Palestinian tech worker that <a href="/news/670812/microsoft-build-protest-keynote-jay-parikh-palestinian-tech-worker">disrupted Jay Parikh</a>, forcing him to briefly pause his presentation and for Microsoft to mute its livestream. Then on Wednesday, two former Microsoft employees disrupted a Build developer session, where the commotion led to a Microsoft executive inadvertently <a href="/news/671373/microsoft-ai-security-chief-walmart-conversation-build-protest-disruption">revealing internal messages regarding Walmart&#8217;s use of AI</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The protests came just days after Microsoft had acknowledged its cloud and AI contracts with Israel, but it claimed it had found &#8220;no evidence&#8221; that its tools were used to &#8220;target or harm people&#8221; in Gaza.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Lopez wasn&#8217;t the only Microsoft employee to send a mass email this week. Jasmina Mathieu, a senior product designer at Microsoft, announced her resignation to thousands of colleagues including the company&#8217;s leadership, and decried Microsoft&#8217;s response to employee protesters. &#8220;It may work as a PR stunt but it&#8217;s easy to conclude, that if the Israeli government is using Azure, they are using it to enable the genocide in Gaza,&#8221; Mathieu said.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Late on Wednesday, Microsoft responded again to the protests, this time by <a href="/tech/672312/microsoft-block-palestine-gaza-email">temporarily blocking any emails</a> sent within the company that include the terms &#8220;Palestine,&#8221; &#8220;Gaza,&#8221; and &#8220;genocide&#8221; in email subject lines or in the body of a message. Microsoft confirmed it had made some changes to its email system in a statement to The Verge. &#8220;Emailing large numbers of employees about any topic not related to work is not appropriate,&#8221; said Microsoft spokesperson <strong>Frank Shaw</strong>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft&#8217;s response to concerns over its Israeli contracts wasn&#8217;t the only thing causing controversy among employees this week. I&#8217;ve spoken to multiple Microsoft employees who weren&#8217;t happy to see Elon Musk appear virtually at Build this week. Nadella invited Musk as part of the announcement that <a href="/news/668762/microsoft-grok-3-xai-models">xAI&#8217;s Grok 3 models are now available on Azure AI Foundry</a>. It was obvious that this would be a controversial move internally, but I understand Nadella has been pushing for it regardless of any potential fallout with employees.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The pad:</h2><ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1ymtmqpi _11h7yix0 _1xwtict1"><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Signal says no to Windows 11&#8217;s Recall screenshots. </strong>Signal says it&#8217;s taking steps to <a href="/news/672210/signal-desktop-app-microsoft-recall-block-windows-11-ai">block Microsoft&#8217;s Recall AI feature</a> from capturing the contents of secure chat messages. Signal is using the same DRM that blocks Windows users from easily screenshotting a Netflix show on their PC, and it could cause problems for people who use accessibility features like screen readers. The move feels like an overreaction to the rollout of Recall, which is only available on the already small number of new Copilot Plus PCs, but one that&#8217;s smart for a privacy-focused app like Signal. Microsoft has made Recall an opt-in feature, so that also cuts down the amount of people who have a Copilot Plus PC and even have it enabled. Signal has gone ahead and pushed this update to all Windows 11 PCs, not just Copilot Plus PCs, so you have to go into Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Screen Security to be able to once again take your own screenshots of Signal messages or use an accessibility tool with the app. </span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>Windows 95 chime composer Brian Eno denounces Microsoft for its ties to the Israeli government. </strong>Artist and musician <strong>Brian Eno </strong>has become the latest voice <a href="/news/671864/brian-eno-windows-95-chime-microsoft-israel-palestine-statement">calling for Microsoft to cut its contracts</a> with the Israeli government.
