<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Verizon has asked the Federal Communications Commission to get rid of the rule requiring it to unlock phones after 60 days. In <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1051935705713/1">a letter</a> to the FCC <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/smartphones-devices/verizon-asks-for-an-end-to-its-phone-unlocking-requirements">spotted by LightReading</a>, Verizon claims the current unlocking requirement &#8220;benefits bad actors and fraudsters.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The FCC first imposed an unlocking requirement following Verizon&#8217;s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2008/05/verizon-we-promise-to-honor-the-block-c-open-access-rules/">purchase of C-Block spectrum in 2008</a>. It forced Verizon to allow customers to change to a new cellular carrier after purchasing a phone from the company, making it easier to switch away from than other providers.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><a href="/2019/2/22/18236759/verizon-fcc-phone-locking-60-day-fraud-identity-theft-protection">After some pushback</a> from Verizon, the FCC <a href="/2019/6/26/18759602/verizon-60-day-phone-lock-fcc-approves">allowed the carrier to lock phones for 60 days</a> after purchase in 2019. Verizon later extended the policy to TracFone following its acquisition of the prepaid provider in 2021. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But now, Verizon wants the 60-day period extended even longer, calling the FCC&#8217;s current requirement &#8220;outdated regulation that has become both burdensome and harmful.&#8221; The company also says eliminating the rule aligns with the FCC&#8217;s recent initiative to <a href="/news/628288/fcc-chair-brendan-carr-deregulate-delete">get rid of &#8220;unnecessary&#8221; regulations</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It adds that &#8220;recent industry experience shows that even a lock of 60 days does not deter device fraud,&#8221; which is why the &#8220;industry standard&#8221; for providers who don&#8217;t have to abide by the 60-day unlocking rule is a minimum of six months.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;Waiving this rule will benefit consumers because it will allow Verizon to continue offering subsidies and other mechanisms to make phones more affordable,&#8221; Verizon says. &#8220;Waiving the rule also will benefit competition because it will eliminate the distorted playing field that currently exists.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Last year, the <a href="/2024/6/27/24187651/fcc-cell-phone-unlock-rules-60-days">FCC proposed rules that would require</a> all providers, including T-Mobile and AT&amp;T, to unlock phones after 60 days of activation.</p></div>
