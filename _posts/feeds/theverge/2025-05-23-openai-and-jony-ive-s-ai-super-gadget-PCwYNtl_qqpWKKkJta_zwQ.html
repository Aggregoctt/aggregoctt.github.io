<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Here&#8217;s what we know: it&#8217;s probably not smart glasses. Beyond that, we don&#8217;t know much about <a href="/news/671838/openai-jony-ive-ai-hardware-apple">what Jony Ive and OpenAI</a> are building through their newly combined company io, except that it&#8217;s some kind of AI super-gadget. But after a couple of years of watching the industry try and shove AI into every form factor you can imagine, we have some guesses.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of The Vergecast</a>, Nilay and David are joined by The Verge&#8217;s <a href="/authors/alex-heath">Alex Heath</a> to talk through all the things we know, kind of know, and don&#8217;t know at all about what io is up to. There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/what-sam-altman-told-openai-about-the-secret-device-hes-making-with-jony-ive-f1384005?mod=rss_Technology">some interesting reporting</a> on the notion of the device as a companion to your phone and laptop, some <a href="/news/672357/openai-ai-device-sam-altman-jony-ive">connections to the original iPod Shuffle</a>, and still a lot of questions about how this will work and whether you&#8217;ll want it. We won&#8217;t see this device for a while, but don&#8217;t worry &#8212; we&#8217;ll surely keep talking about it.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">After that, the hosts run down <a href="/news/669408/google-io-2025-biggest-announcements-ai-gemini">all the news from Google I/O</a>, which both Alex and Nilay attended in person. We talk about Google&#8217;s <a href="/google-io/670386/google-astra-universal-ai-assistant-prototype-io-2025">wildly ambitious</a> and <a href="/tech/671116/google-ai-product-names-confusing-gemini-deepmind-astra">wildly confusing</a> set of AI products, the ways Gemini and Search <a href="/google-io/670439/google-ai-mode-search-io-2025">are encroaching on one anothe</a>r, and what this all means for <a href="/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/669409/microsoft-cto-kevin-scott-interview-ai-natural-language-search-openai">the future of the web</a>. It was an impressive, confident developer conference for Google, and the AI race appears hotter than ever.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Finally, in the lightning round, it&#8217;s time for another edition of Brendan Carr is a Dummy, because, well, you know the reason. We also talk about some breaking smart glasses news from Apple, and Alex&#8217;s experience with <a href="/hands-on/671077/project-moohan-android-xr-google-io-2025-smart-glasses-wearables">the Android XR prototypes</a> at I/O. It seems like everybody except OpenAI is betting on smart glasses. We&#8217;ll see who&#8217;s right.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, first on Io:</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">And on I/O:</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">And in Microsoft Build / web news:</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">And in the lightning round:</p></div>
