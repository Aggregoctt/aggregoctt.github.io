<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Discord has become the place for gaming communities on the internet. The company just celebrated its <a href="https://discord.com/blog/thank-you-for-ten-years">10th anniversary</a>, and its impact is now big enough that it&#8217;s available directly on PlayStation and Xbox and was ripped off by Nintendo for the Switch 2&#8217;s GameChat.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But as it tries to grow, one of the big challenges Discord faces is that, for big or longer-running communities, it can be hard to know where to start, hard to catch up to the speed of real-time conversations, and hard to sift through the potentially huge amounts of conversations and channels. A lot of communities used to form around forums, but Discord just isn&#8217;t a good replacement for that kind of structured messaging, as covered <a href="https://aftermath.site/discord-forums-move-champions-neverwinter-star-trek-support-faq">by Aftermath&#8217;s Luke Plunkett</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;This is something we want to solve,&#8221; Peter Sellis, Discord&#8217;s SVP of product, tells The Verge. &#8220;It is not our intention to lock a bunch of this knowledge into Discord.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">One way Discord wants to tackle the problem is add features that are &#8220;more amicable to structured knowledge sharing, like forums, that we could probably do a better job of investing in and is something we want to do for game developers,&#8221; Sellis says.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Another involves LLMs. &#8220;There&#8217;s an incredible opportunity now with large language models and their ability to summarize conversations,&#8221; he says. That could help Discord take a long conversation between multiple people &#8212; &#8220;what is essentially a really poorly structured shareable object,&#8221; he says &#8212; and boil it down to &#8220;something that could be more shareable and then potentially syndicated to the web.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Sellis couldn&#8217;t share many other details, and couldn&#8217;t give a timeline for when any of this might be ready: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen a solution that we feel great about yet.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Discord wants to do it right, he says &#8212; especially because a solution that makes information more easily accessible outside of Discord could involve a lot of work for server moderators and admins. &#8220;We have a very sensitive radar for stuff that causes them a bunch of work that doesn&#8217;t give them the return they need,&#8221; he says. (It&#8217;s wise <a href="/2023/7/1/23781306/reddit-moderators-iama-celebrity-ama">not to piss off your moderators</a>.)</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">None of this was imminent, if it even happens at all. That said, &#8220;I assure you that this is something that people within Discord feel the pain of themselves,&#8221; Sellis says. &#8220;And when our engineers and product designers and product managers feel it personally, they generally want to solve it.&#8221; </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Another big challenge Discord faces is how to build the product to serve both the needs of giant community servers and the tiny servers where groups hang out &#8212; especially when, according to Discord, 90 percent of &#8220;all activity on Discord&#8221; happens in &#8220;small, intimate servers.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Sellis calls it &#8220;one of the biggest challenges for the team&#8221; &#8212; but also says that it&#8217;s &#8220;honestly the biggest opportunity.&#8221; He says that Discord thinks about how it can make people &#8220;feel comfortable in both these spaces, understand that there are different types of spaces, and the technology is familiar, but still different in both of these places.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Sellis says that the biggest Discord server is Midjourney, a key company in text-to-AI image generation that lets you generate visuals right inside Discord. Midjourney became popular because it turned the &#8220;single-player game&#8221; of generating AI images into a multiplayer community. &#8220;You can just watch people try things, experiment, fail, succeed, embarrass themselves, etc. And that made it kind of like a collective action.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">He says Discord is seeing something similar with the recently launched <a href="https://support-apps.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/31598005086359-Wordle-FAQ#h_01JV3DTV60EKV39E0Y1ZAXERGX">Wordle app</a> on the platform, too, which lets you compete with your friends. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">That all speaks to some of Discord&#8217;s larger vision. Sellis is seeing a trend that &#8220;everything is starting to kind of look like a game&#8221; and &#8220;Discord can be used as a social layer on any game to essentially improve its engagement, its socialness, and its multiplayer capacity. That&#8217;s something we like and are going to lean into.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">And as for Nintendo&#8217;s <a href="/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">GameChat</a>? &#8220;I would say imitation is a very sincere form of flattery,&#8221; Sellis says. &#8220;Hard to imagine being more flattered than being copied by Nintendo.&#8221;</p></div>
