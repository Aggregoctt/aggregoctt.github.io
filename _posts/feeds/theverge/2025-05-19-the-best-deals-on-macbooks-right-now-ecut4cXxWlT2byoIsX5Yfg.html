<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points. <a href="/2024/3/4/24090015/apple-discontinues-m1-macbook-air-leaving-behind-its-iconic-wedge-design">It discontinued the M1 MacBook Air</a> to make room for newer models, but some retailers are still selling the last-gen laptop starting at $649 &#8212; a far cry from the $2,499 starting price of the <a href="/2024/10/30/24270706/apple-macbook-pro-m4-pro-max-14-16-announcement-specs">latest 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Purchasing a new MacBook can certainly be a pricey endeavor, but thankfully, finding a deal is actually not that difficult. Apple has recently shaken up the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before and resulting in steeper discounts on older models.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Although Macs may not get perpetual discounts, it&#8217;s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $400. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It&#8217;s also the only option to find certain SKUs of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases. <a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac&amp;subid1=vergedeals030724" rel="sponsored">Apple&#8217;s refurbished store</a> provides a one-year warranty on all products, and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But if you want to buy new and you&#8217;re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best MacBook Air deals</h2><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">M1 MacBook Air</h3><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <a href="/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"><strong>M1 MacBook Air</strong></a> was considered Apple&#8217;s entry-level laptop before the M3 model&#8217;s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and in brick-and-mortar stores. But while the <a href="/laptop-review/23207440/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review">redesigned M2 version of the MacBook Air</a> (which has been with us for a while as well) has taken over as the top value choice, the 2020 version with an M1 processor and fanless design remains available at some retailers as a solid budget option. It&#8217;s best suited for non-intensive productivity work, plus it has a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it&#8217;s long enough in the tooth to have been removed in our <a href="/21250695/best-laptops">guide to the best laptops</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It&#8217;s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart has <a href="/2024/3/15/24101727/apple-m1-macbook-air-laptop-walmart">committed to keeping it around</a> for the foreseeable future and is currently <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Silver-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage%2F609040889%2F" rel="sponsored">discounting it to $649</a> ($350 off), which is $20 shy of its lowest price to date.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Space-Gray-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage%2F609040889%2F" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2020 MacBook Air with M1 (256GB)</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 649</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 699</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">7 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 649</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">The 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company&#8217;s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold).</p><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">M2 MacBook Air</h3><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The M2 MacBook Air is a slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Although its M2 processor wasn&#8217;t as revolutionary as the M1 generation, it&#8217;s a better performer for any kind of user than the M1, including creators with demanding workloads.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It does have some slight downsides, though, including <a href="/2022/7/1/23191141/apple-macbook-pro-13-m2-base-model-slow-device">slower storage in the base 256GB configuration</a> and a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, Apple hasn&#8217;t offered a more travel-friendly laptop than this one since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of the <a href="/21250695/best-laptops">best laptops</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <a href="/laptop-review/23207440/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review">M2-powered MacBook Air</a> from 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability waning. However, you can get the 13.6-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU in select colors at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-macbook-air-13-inch-apple-m2-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-midnight%2F6602763.p%3FacampID%3D0%26affgroup%3D%2522Content%2522%252C%2522Howl%2BMigrated%2BPartners%2522%252C%2522May%2BContract%2BChange%2522%252C%2522Partners%2Bto%2BKeep%2522%252C%2522Temp%2B0%2525%2522%26irclickid%3D1ngXNix1oxycUYK11Bwh9QfKUksRLrQFQ2yxU00%26irgwc%3D1%26loc%3DVox%2BMedia%26mpid%3D482924%26ref%3D198%26skuId%3D6602763" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> starting at $799 ($200 off), which is $50 shy of its all-time low price. If you don&#8217;t mind sacrificing some memory for extra storage, you can also get the 13-inch Air with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-macbook-air-13-6-laptop-m2-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-8gb-memory-512gb-ssd-silver%2F6509647.p%3FskuId%3D6509647" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for $799 ($200 off).</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s a bit harder to find discounts on the 15.3-inch MacBook Air M2, however. While it&#8217;s scantily in stock at some retailers for its original MSRP, you&#8217;d be better off going with a discounted M3 model.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-macbook-air-13-6-laptop-m2-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-8gb-memory-512gb-ssd-silver%2F6509647.p%3FskuId%3D6509647" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">13-inch MacBook Air with M2 (2022)</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 799</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 999</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">20 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 799</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">The 2022 MacBook Air is a thin, lightweight device powered by Apple&#8217;s M2 chip. The M2 model touts an improved 1080p webcam and a better display than its predecessor while retaining features like long battery life and MagSafe charging.</p><h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">M3 MacBook Air</h3><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The M1 Air and its wedge had to perish for the <a href="/24114684/apple-macbook-air-m3-13-15-inch-2024-review">M3 MacBook Air</a> to exist. Apple&#8217;s updated entry-level laptops arrived in both 13.6- and 15.3-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port, though the M3 Air starts at a slightly higher price than its predecessor at $1,099. That said, Apple recently discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM and <a href="/2024/10/30/24282981/apple-macbook-air-m2-m3-16gb-ram-minimum-price-unchanged">now considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Right now, the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air is available in its entry-level configuration with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD on sale at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1860126-REG%2Fapple_mc8k4ll_a_13_macbook_air_m3.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> in select colors starting at $829 ($270 off).

Interestingly, the new Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a new sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. There&#8217;s a lot to like.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some good discounts.

Apple followed the M3 models up with <a href="/2024/10/30/24270706/apple-macbook-pro-m4-pro-max-14-16-announcement-specs">M4-based machines in October 2024</a>, and we&#8217;re already starting to see the discounts on them.

Now starting with the M3 Pro chip (or the speedier M3 Max) and 18GB of base RAM instead of 16GB, the new models remain targeted at creatives doing content work like video editing, photo processing, and other graphical work. Like their predecessors and the M1 Pro generation before that, they offer MagSafe charging, three USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI-out, and a full-size SD card slot, with prices starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch.
