excerpt: Rode has announced a firmware update for its Wireless Micro microphone system
  introducing a new feature called Direct Connect that allows the mic to directly
  connect to iOS devices over Bluetooth. Previously, you needed to use the company’s
  USB-C dongle receiver. First launched last November, Rode’s $149 Wireless Micro
  pairs two tiny rechargeable lavalier mics [&#8230;]

<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Rode has <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frode.com%2Fen%2Fabout%2Fnews-info%2Fintroducing-direct-connect-for-wireless-micro-no-receiver-necessary" rel="sponsored">announced a firmware update</a> for its <a href="/2024/11/11/24294134/rodes-wireless-mics-are-now-less-bulky">Wireless Micro microphone system</a> introducing a new feature called Direct Connect that allows the mic to directly connect to iOS devices over Bluetooth. Previously, you needed to use the company&#8217;s USB-C dongle receiver.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">First launched last November, Rode&#8217;s $149 <a href="/2024/11/26/24306595/dji-mic-mini-vs-rode-wireless-micro">Wireless Micro pairs two tiny rechargeable lavalier mics</a> with a wireless receiver that connects directly to mobile devices using their USB-C charging ports (or in the case of older iPhones and iPads, the Lightning port). The receiver can connect to and record from both of the microphones simultaneously using Rode&#8217;s mobile app, with a wireless range of 328 feet.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The new Direct Connect feature takes that wireless receiver out of the equation so the mics can now connect directly to a smartphone. That approach potentially allows for simpler setups, but it does come with a few compromises. The feature is only compatible with iOS devices &#8212; not Android &#8212; and audio can only be captured from a single Wireless Micro mic at a time. The use of Bluetooth also reduces the range of the microphones, and the wireless connection may not be as stable as it is when using the receiver.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Other upgrades in the firmware update include a new noise reduction feature that helps minimize unwanted background sounds while recording in environments where silence can&#8217;t be guaranteed. That feature can be activated for each microphone independently. There&#8217;s also a new output gain control that &#8220;lets users easily adjust recording levels directly within the app,&#8221; and when using the wireless receiver connected to both mics, the audio can be captured to a single merged stereo track or recorded independently to separate channels for more flexibility while editing afterwards.</p></div>
