<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">SAG-AFTRA, the organization that represents voice, motion, and screen performers, has filed an <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-statement-fortnites-use-ai-darth-vader-voice-and-ulp-filing">unfair labor complaint against Epic Games</a>. The complaint stems from the company&#8217;s recent introduction of an AI programmed to sound like <a href="/news/668349/fortnite-star-wars-james-earl-jones-vader-ai-voice">James Earl Jones&#8217; Darth Vader that can respond to a player&#8217;s actions and questions</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">SAG-AFTRA wrote in a statement that it understands its members and members&#8217; estates wish to use AI technology in any way they choose. &#8220;However,&#8221; SAG-AFTRA&#8217;s statement continued, &#8220;we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader&#8217;s iconic rhythm and tone in video games.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">While the AI &#8220;revolution&#8221; slowly replaces human workers with oftentimes inferior products and despite <a href="/2024/1/10/24033258/sag-aftra-ai-video-game-voice-acting-licensing-replica-studios">some members&#8217; distaste for the practice</a>, <a href="/2023/11/18/23962349/sag-aftra-tentative-agreement-generative-artificial-intelligence-vote">SAG-AFTRA has embraced the idea of using AI</a> trained to replicate an actor&#8217;s performance. It has <a href="/2024/10/29/24283240/sag-aftra-has-announced-an-agreement-with-ethovox-which-is-building-a-foundational-ai-model-for-voic">established contracts and partnerships with several AI companies</a> with the idea being members can use this technology with specific contract-guaranteed protections. So the act of using an AI to replace Darth Vader&#8217;s voice performers (both the late James Earl Jones and those brought in after his death to match his performance) isn&#8217;t what SAG-AFTRA is objecting to. Rather it&#8217;s the fact that this was done without Epic Games sitting down with SAG-AFTRA at the bargaining table to hash out the specifics. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;Fortnite&#8217;s signatory company, Llama Productions, chose to replace the work of human performers with AI. technology,&#8221; SAG-AFTRA wrote. &#8220;Unfortunately, they did so without providing any notice of their intent to do this and without bargaining with us over appropriate terms.&#8221; The Verge has reached out to Epic Games for comment.<a href="/2024/8/5/24213808/video-game-voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra">AI and its use in video game voice and motion performance</a> is the main stumbling block in the ongoing video game voice actor strike. Negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the signatory companies of its interactive media agreement broke down last year and performers have been on strike since July &#8211; a length of time that eclipses both the actors and writers strike of 2023.</p></div>
