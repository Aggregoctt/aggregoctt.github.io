<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">We&#8217;re in an age where you can realistically delegate tasks to smart hunks of metal, whether it&#8217;s a self-driving car or a robot that can clean on your behalf. Most of us probably won&#8217;t be able to afford the helpful sentient humanoids being developed in our lifetimes, but robot vacuums are an affordable way to experience that promised utopia right now.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Today&#8217;s floor cleaners are also more advanced than ever. In addition to vacuuming, many of the best models can now mop, allowing you to tackle both carpet and hardwood flooring. Some can automatically dispense of their trash and dirty water, too, and clean their own components without intervention. Soon, we&#8217;ll even have models that can <a href="/2025/1/8/24338956/dreame-robot-vacuum-legs-arm-tools">pick up dirty laundry</a> and <a href="/2025/1/5/24333438/switchbot-multitasking-household-robot-k20-plus-pro-price-specs-release-date">purify the air</a> in your home, preventing you from having to lift a finger.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But if you need something relatively affordable for daily cleaning, you&#8217;d be surprised how little you have to pay for premium features. Below, we&#8217;ve listed the best deals currently available on a slate of Verge-approved robot vacuums, whether you prefer a budget entry-level model from Yeedi or a top-of-the-line offering from iRobot, Dreame, and more.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best Roborock deals</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><strong>Roborock&#8217;s S8 MaxV Ultra</strong> &#8212; our pick for the best robot vacuum overall &#8212; is available from <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Froborock-s8-maxv-ultra-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-flexiarm-design-side-brush-10000-pa-suction-and-8-in-1-rockdock-ultra-white%2F6579466.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.roborock.com%2Fproducts%2Froborock-s8-maxv-ultra%2F" rel="sponsored">Roborock</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQLQVTDH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> for $1,299.99 ($500 off), which is $200 shy of its best price to date. The combination of a 10,000Pa suction power and dual rubber roller brushes makes it a terrific vacuum, one that can easily pick up pet hair and other debris. It can also mop with great efficiency thanks to a sonic mopping system that vibrates the mop pad 4,000 times a minute, allowing it to clean sticky juices, thick condiments, and other common spills. The mop arm can extend to cover corners and baseboard edges, too.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The S8 MaxV Ultra&#8217;s camera-equipped AI obstacle avoidance makes it the best navigator in Roborock&#8217;s lineup and one of the top models overall, though it&#8217;s not quite as strong as Roomba&#8217;s. The mobile app offers ample options to customize cleaning zones and schedules, and you can use its dedicated voice assistant to start and stop routines. It&#8217;s also a Matter-ready robot that&#8217;s compatible with Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQLQVTDH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 1300</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 1800</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">28 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 1300</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">With top-notch vacuuming performance, an easy-to-use app, and built-in voice control, the S8 MaxV Ultra is a superb vacuum and good mop. It features Roborock&#8217;s best obstacle detection, innovative features like dirt detection, and a hands-free dock that makes it an expensive but excellent choice.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <strong>Roborock S8 Plus</strong> is another great robot vacuum / mop hybrid that&#8217;s available for $519.99 ($480 off) &#8212; its second-best price to date &#8212; from <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRoborock-S8-Robot-Vacuum-Cleaner-and-Sonic-Mopping-with-Auto-Emptying-DuoRoller-Brush-6000-Pa-and-Obstacle-Avoidance-Black%2F2816748580" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.roborock.com%2Fproducts%2Froborock-s8-plus%2F" rel="sponsored">Roborock</a>. It offers a vibrating mop pad that scrubs floors well, and, like the S8 MaxV Ultra, it features dual rubber roller brushes. It&#8217;s not as powerful as the MaxV Ultra given its 6,000Pa of suction, but it still does a good job of sucking up dirt from carpets. It also lacks a water tank, though you do get good obstacle detection and a smaller auto-empty dock that saves space.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRoborock-S8-Robot-Vacuum-Cleaner-and-Sonic-Mopping-with-Auto-Emptying-DuoRoller-Brush-6000-Pa-and-Obstacle-Avoidance-Black%2F2816748580" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Roborock S8 Plus</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 520</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 1000</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">48 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 520</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">Roborock&#8217;s hybrid S8 robot vacuum and mop features 6,000Pa of suction and sonic mopping, which means its flat mop pad vibrates to scrub floors. It has dual rubber roller brushes that do a great job on carpet, and it can lift its mop to avoid carpet. It also has an auto-empty dock option.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best Dreame deals</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <strong>Dreame X40 Ultra</strong> is another mopping robot, and while it&#8217;s on the more expensive side, you can currently pick it up for $999.99 ($500 off) &#8212; $100 shy of its all-time low &#8212; from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dreametech.com%2Fproducts%2Fdreametech-x40-ultra-robot-vacuum" rel="sponsored">Dreame</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dreame-Removable-SideBrush-Extensive-Auto-Empty/dp/B0CXDXKSXP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. You&#8217;re paying a premium for 12,000Pa of suction power and a pair of removable, self-retracting mop pads, which it can automatically clean and dry on its own using the included base. It can also empty its own bin and refill its own water tank.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Dreame X40 Ultra features an extendable side brush and mop pads, too, offering better coverage for baseboards, corners, and the underside of your furniture. It uses a combination of AI-powered cameras and &#8220;3D-structured light&#8221; (presumably based on lidar technology) to map and navigate rooms, with customizable keep-out zones and more functions available in the app. There&#8217;s also a dirt detection system that can identify messier spills and adjust its cleaning routine accordingly.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/dreame-Removable-SideBrush-Extensive-Auto-Empty/dp/B0CXDXKSXP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dreame X40 Ultra</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 1000</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 1500</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">33 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 1000</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">With a unique ability to remove and reattach its mop pads, the Dreame X40 solves the problem of vacuuming carpets (with 12,000Pa suction power) while also mopping hard floors. Its mops can also swing out and under low furniture, getting where most bots can&#8217;t reach.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <strong>Dream L20 Ultra</strong> is available for an all-time low of $549.98 ($450 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dreame-Mop-Extend-Self-Emptying-Self-Refilling-Avoidance/dp/B0CC236CLT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. The L20 Ultra is an excellent alternative to Dreame&#8217;s newer flagship robots, including the X40. It lacks a bit of power in comparison, though its 7,000Pa of suction power is still enough for most cleaning jobs. It also doesn&#8217;t have the L40&#8217;s tri-cut brush, which makes the step-up model more efficient at picking up pet hair. The only other real advantage the X40 holds over the L20 is its self-extending arms for vacuuming (though the dual mop pads can extend a bit for baseboard and corner coverage), nor does it have dirt detection.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The L20 Ultra&#8217;s base station is rather large, but it can take care of the entire cleaning process, including emptying the dustbin, emptying and refilling the water tanks, and washing and drying the mop pads. It doesn&#8217;t have a heated cleaning function for the mop pads, however. It uses a lidar-based AI-powered navigation system, and you can prompt it to start cleaning by voice using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/dreame-Mop-Extend-Self-Emptying-Self-Refilling-Avoidance/dp/B0CC236CLT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dreame L20 Ultra</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 550</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 1000</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">45 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 550</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">The L20 Ultra is a great all-around bot that can remove its mop pads to vacuum carpet and do the splits with its mops to better clean your baseboards. It has 7,000Pa suction, a bigger base station, and fewer advanced cleaning features than the newer X30 and X40 Ultra models, but it&#8217;s still an excellent robot vacuum.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best SwitchBot deals</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <strong>SwitchBot S10</strong> is available with a free water tank for $459.99 ($740 off) &#8212; $69 shy of its all-time low &#8212; when you check out <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.switch-bot.com%2Fproducts%2Fswitchbot-floor-cleaning-robot-s10" rel="sponsored">via Roborock&#8217;s online storefront</a> with promo code <strong>MDYLOM</strong>. The S10 is one of the most affordable robot vacuum / mop hybrids you can buy, one that can refill its own tank so long as you hook the battery-powered base station into your home&#8217;s plumbing. It can also dry its own mop pads and empty its own bin at a separate docking bay, and offers enough capacity to run for up to 90 days without intervention.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The S10&#8217;s self-cleaning roller mop is more effective than the typical pads we see in most other units, but it&#8217;s also limited to a smaller coverage area. It only has a single roller brush for vacuuming, but its respectable 6,500Pa suction can make up for it. And while it has lidar mapping and AI-powered obstacle avoidance, we found it still has a tendency to get stuck on laundry, bath mats, and other obstacles. The S10 is also one of the few <a href="/2024/4/9/24125273/switchbot-robot-vacuum-matter-support">robovacs with Matter support</a>, however, which effectively enables native control through Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa (though said platforms don&#8217;t yet fully support robot vacuums).</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.switch-bot.com%2Fproducts%2Fswitchbot-floor-cleaning-robot-s10" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SwitchBot S10</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 460</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 1199</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">62 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 460</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">The S10 is a great mopping robot with a battery-powered water refill dock that makes it the most hands-free robovac we&#8217;ve tested. A separate auto-empty dock takes care of the dust. It&#8217;s big and loud and lacks some features found on high-end robots, but it does a great job of keeping your floors clean.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <strong>SwitchBot K10 Plus</strong> is also available for an all-time low of $199.99 ($200 off) directly from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.switch-bot.com%2Fproducts%2Fswitchbot-mini-robot-vacuum-k10%2F" rel="sponsored">SwitchBot</a> with promo code <strong>LMTM120</strong>. At 3.6 inches high and 9.8 inches wide, it&#8217;s a more petite option if you want something that can maneuver tighter spaces, which it does to decent success with a lidar-based mapping system that supports digital keep-out zones. It only has 2,500Pa suction, but that should be powerful enough to lift dirt in all but the deepest carpeting. You can also attach disposable mopping pads, though their mopping function doesn&#8217;t work well. The K10 Plus comes with a self-emptying dock that can hold a respectable four liters of dirt before it needs emptying.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.switch-bot.com%2Fproducts%2Fswitchbot-mini-robot-vacuum-k10%2F" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SwitchBot K10 Plus</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 200</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 400</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">50 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 200</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">The smallest robot vac on the block, the K10 Plus, doesn&#8217;t compare to the other bots here in terms of performance, but if you have a small space where other vacs can&#8217;t get to, it&#8217;s better than nothing. It&#8217;s also very quiet, making it ideal for small spaces like home offices and bedrooms or a very small studio apartment.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best Eufy deals</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <strong>Eufy X10 Pro Omni</strong>, our current pick for the best midrange robot vacuum / mop, is now available at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPFBBHP4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> for $699.99 ($100 off), which is about $150 shy of the all-time low we last saw during Amazon&#8217;s Big Spring Sale. You can also grab it <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/ung9fkamv1txn">directly from Eufy</a> for the same price when you use promo code <strong>WS24T2351121</strong> at checkout.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The X10 Pro Omni is a bit of a novelty, at least in comparison to other robovacs in its price range, in that it offers AI-powered obstacle detection, which allows it to deftly navigate cables and other clutter. It also features a slew of functions you&#8217;d expect from top-of-the-line models, including 8,000Pa of suction power, speedy lidar-powered mapping, and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Mind you, none of these features are as effective as they are on more premium models, though the result is an all-in-one bot that punches above its weight. Plus, it has heated mop drying and onboard water reservoir, the latter of which prevents it from having to return to its multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill dock too frequently.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPFBBHP4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eufy X10 Pro Omni</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 700</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 800</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">13 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 700</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">The X10 is a great robovac with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, powerful oscillating mops, a user-friendly app, and good mapping capabilities.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you&#8217;re looking for a bump-and-roll model that&#8217;s relatively budget-friendly, the Eufy 11S Max is on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Super-Thin-Super-Strong-Self-Charging-Medium-Pile/dp/B07R295MLS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> for just $159.99 ($90 off). The 11S Max stands out from other robovacs because it doesn&#8217;t use Wi-Fi, meaning it doesn&#8217;t require you to fiddle with a mobile app on your phone. Instead, you can control it using an on-board button or with the included remote, which also allows you to create cleaning schedules. It&#8217;s relatively quiet and reliable, too, with 2,000Pa of suction power and replaceable parts, making it a great long-term investment for those who want something basic.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R295MLS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eufy 11S Max</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 160</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 280</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">43 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 160</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">The Eufy 11S Max is a super slim, repairable bump-and-roll bot with a large 600ml bin and three cleaning levels. Its biggest selling point, however, is that it lacks Wi-Fi, meaning you don&#8217;t have to fiddle with an app.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best Yeedi deals</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The <strong>Yeedi Cube</strong> is currently down to an all-time low of $246.99 ($243 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yeedi-Washing-Emptying-Obstacle-Climbing/dp/B0CDX5QL9T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> for Prime members. It&#8217;s not easy to find a self-emptying / self-cleaning vacuum at this price, as those features are typically only available on robots that cost upward of $600 or more.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">With 5,100Pa of suction power, the Cube can tackle most common vacuuming scenarios, though its single hybrid rubber / bristle brush can get easily tangled with pet hair. It mops better than most models in its range, however, namely because its vibrating microfiber pads can actually scrub your floors. The Cube uses lasers for object avoidance, too, though it&#8217;s not as effective for navigation as those with lidar and AI smarts. It can avoid large furniture and other objects, but it might need your help rerouting around cables, toys, and laundry. Still, we found it navigates better than most other robots under $300.</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Yeedi-Washing-Emptying-Obstacle-Climbing/dp/B0CDX5QL9T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yeedi Cube</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 247</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 470</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">47 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 247</span><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1xwtict1">One of the first robots that can vacuum, mop, self-empty, self-wash, and self-dry with hot air for under $1,000, the Yeedi Cube is an older model that currently retails for under $500.
