<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Wooting set the standard for gaming keyboards with the original 60HE three years ago, and now it&#8217;s ready to launch a successor with an upgraded design. The <a href="https://wooting.io/wooting-60he-v2">60HE v2</a> will be available later this year with true 8K polling, a new closed-bottom switch, and an aluminum case that should all add up to a faster keyboard with an improved sound and feel.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The original 60HE popularized the use of Hall effect switches and a Rapid Trigger system. Together they sped up how quickly you can activate a key, improving competitive PC gaming. <a href="/2023/12/5/23989237/keychron-q1-he-hall-effect-analog-switches-price-release-date-specs-features-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron</a>, <a href="/2023/8/10/23823001/corsair-k70-max-keyboard-price-release-date-specs-features-switches">Corsair</a>, <a href="/2022/6/22/23178213/steelseries-apex-pro-mini-wireless-mechanical-keyboards-hall-effect-omnipoint">SteelSeries</a>, and many others followed Wooting and now offer similar boards with Hall effect switches and Rapid Trigger-like systems.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The upgraded 60HE v2 will improve the original model&#8217;s speed thanks to true 8K polling and a low input latency of just 0.125ms. That&#8217;s the same latency as the 8kHz USB polling on the larger <a href="/2024/9/18/24247911/wooting-80he-keyboard-gaming-hands-on">80HE that Wooting launched</a> last year.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Wooting is also shipping the 60HE v2 with a new &#8220;Lekker Tikken&#8221; switch, a closed-bottom Hall effect switch with a 4.0 mm actuation range. Hall effect switches use a magnet so the board can track how far a switch has been pressed, but the sound profile has typically been worse than Cherry MX-style switches. Gateron, Neon, and other switch makers have been steadily improving the sound profile of HE switches over the past few years, and Wooting&#8217;s upgraded switch promises a &#8220;uniquely marbly sound signature.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Wooting has also improved the acoustics and typing feel by using a PET film layer beneath these new switches, and a Poron sandwich pad between the plate and PCB that&#8217;s designed to reduce vibrations. 60HE v2 owners will also be able to swap between a silicone block, which has soft sounds, or an EPDM foam block that produces a louder sounding board.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you&#8217;re a fan of a split-spacebar then you&#8217;ll also be able to choose this option on the 60HE v2, and Wooting is even shipping this upgraded design inside a premium aluminum case. Just like the 60He before it, the v2 will be fully customizable and compatible with most after-market cases and keyboard parts.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;The original 60HE wouldn&#8217;t have happened without our community, and neither would this,&#8221; says Wooting CEO Calder Limmen. &#8220;We&#8217;ve learned a lot since the first release. The 60HE v2 is the next step.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The Wooting 60HE v2 is expected to launch in Q4 2025, but Wooting hasn&#8217;t revealed pricing or exact release dates just yet.</p></div>
