<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft is starting to integrate AI shortcuts, or what it calls AI actions, into the File Explorer in Windows 11. These shortcuts let you right-click on a file and quickly get to Windows AI features like blurring the background of a photo, erasing objects, or even summarizing content from Office files.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Four image actions are currently being tested in <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/05/19/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26200-5603-dev-channel/">the latest Dev Channel builds</a> of Windows 11, including Bing visual search to find similar images on the web, the blur background and erase objects features found in the Photos app, and the remove background option in Paint.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft is also planning to test similar AI actions for Office files soon, enabling you to summarize documents stored in OneDrive or SharePoint, or quickly create AI-generated lists from files. These Office AI actions will be limited to Microsoft 365 commercial subscribers with a Copilot license, and consumer support is &#8220;coming later.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">It&#8217;s not clear if these AI actions can be disabled in the context menu, but they also join an &#8220;Ask Copilot&#8221; option that Microsoft added to the right-click menu of the File Explorer recently.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Alongside the AI-powered shortcuts in File Explorer, Microsoft is also testing some visual changes to the widgets feature in Windows 11, &#8220;with a more organized, personalized, and engaging feed,&#8221; according to the Windows Insider team. &#8220;In addition, we are introducing Copilot-curated stories into the feed.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">This latest Dev Channel build also includes a new &#8220;User Interaction-Aware CPU Power Management&#8221; feature, which Microsoft describes as an OS-level change to reduce power consumption on laptops and tablets. &#8220;After a period of inactivity on your PC, Windows now conserves power by automatically applying efficient power management policies,&#8221; says the Windows Insider team. &#8220;This happens seamlessly to save energy while you&#8217;re inactive, with full performance instantly restored the moment you get back to it.&#8221;</p></div>
