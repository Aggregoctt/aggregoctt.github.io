<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">WiiM has announced three new wireless audiophile devices including the brand&#8217;s <a href="https://www.blog.wiimhome.com/post/introducing-wiim-sound-your-smart-speaker-for-high-res-room-filling-audio">first smart speaker called the Sound</a> with a design that looks inspired by the <a href="/2018/2/6/16976906/apple-homepod-review-smart-speaker">Apple HomePod</a>. The speaker is joined by the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.blog.wiimhome.com/post/introducing-wiim-sub-pro-experience-bass-like-never-before">first sub-woofer called the Sub Pro</a> that pumps out 250W of bass, and the <a href="https://www.blog.wiimhome.com/post/wiim-amp-ultra-performance-meets-precision">WiiM Amp Ultra</a>, a new amplifier that can stream directly from services like Spotify, Amazon Music, Tidal, Deezer, and Pandora.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The WiiM Sound features playback controls on the top as well as a 1.8-inch high-res touchscreen on the side that can also be used for navigating playlists and menus, selecting presets, or just displaying album art for whatever&#8217;s currently playing. Using a four-inch woofer and &#8220;dual-balanced mode radiator tweeters&#8221; the Sound delivers 100W of power or more with two of them configured as a left and right stereo pair.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The speaker uses a built-in microphone to measure the acoustics in a room and optimize its sound output for the space, but it can also be customized using a 10-band EQ or one of 24 different preset sound profiles. With Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and an ethernet port, the WiiM Sound can stream from over 20 different music services or from apps on other devices using Chromecast, Spotify Connect, TIDAL Connect, DLNA, or Alexa Cast.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Hands-free operation is made possible through Alexa, Google Assistant, or an included wireless remote that supports voice commands. WiiM expects the Sound to be available sometime in the third quarter of 2025 through Amazon and &#8220;select retailers,&#8221; but says it won&#8217;t reveal pricing for any of the products it announced today until they launch.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If WiiM&#8217;s smart speaker doesn&#8217;t deliver enough low-end performance for your ears, it can be paired with the new Sub Pro which features an eight-inch driver and a Class-D amplifier that works in the 25-200Hz frequency range.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Connectivity includes Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, ethernet, and an RCA input for connecting to home theater gear, while the Sub Pro offers the same customizability as the Sound smart speaker with automatic room correction and a 10-band EQ available through WiiM&#8217;s mobile app.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Wiim calls its new WiiM Amp Ultra its &#8220;most refined streaming amplifier yet.&#8221; Featuring a unibody aluminum chassis with a 3.5-inch touchscreen on the front, the amp uses audiophile-grade components including an ESS ES9039Q2M Sabre DAC and can deliver 100W of power per channel to drive up to four passive speakers simultaneously.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Dual antennas help ensure fast and stable streaming over a Wi-Fi 6E or Bluetooth 5.3 connection, even while listening to high-res music at 24-bit/192kHz quality. Through the WiiM Home app the WiiM Amp Ultra can stream from several popular services including Spotify and Amazon Music while support for Google Cast, Alexa Cast, DLNA, Spotify Connect, TIDAL Connect, DLNA, and Roon facilitates streaming from other apps. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The amp also supports voice controls through Alexa, Google Assistant, and its bundled wireless remote, includes an HDMI ARC port with support for Dolby Digital decoding, and has a dedicated subwoofer output so it can be paired with WiiM&#8217;s new Sub Pro.</p></div>
