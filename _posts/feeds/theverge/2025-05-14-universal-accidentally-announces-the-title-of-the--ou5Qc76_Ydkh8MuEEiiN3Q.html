<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Universal appears to have confirmed that the next Mario film will be titled Super Mario World. The title was included in a press release about upcoming movies, but apparently by mistake, since it was removed shortly after publication.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The title first appeared in a <a href="https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/nbcuniversal-presents-2025-upfront-content-slate-">press release about NBCUniversal&#8217;s upcoming content slate</a>, listed as part of a selection of films scheduled to stream exclusively on NBC&#8217;s Peacock following their theatrical release. Within hours the post had been updated and &#8220;Super Mario World&#8221; removed, along with mentions of Shrek and Minions movies.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The title makes some sense. The first film&#8217;s post-credit scene teased the arrival of Mario&#8217;s bright green dinosaur steed / friend Yoshi, who made his videogame debut in&#8230; Super Mario World, which launched on the SNES in 1990. It was the console&#8217;s most popular game, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200908004707/http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2015/09/30-best-selling-super-mario-games-of-all-time-on-the-plumbers-30th-birthday/">selling more than 20 million copies</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The upcoming sequel to The Super Mario Bros. Movie was <a href="/2024/3/10/24096213/super-mario-bros-movie-2-sequel-2026">announced in March 2024</a>, with a launch planned for April 3rd, 2026, and directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic returning to lead the production. A sequel came as no big surprise after the first film brought in <a href="/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">over $1 billion worldwide</a>. Nintendo took that as a green light to ramp up its entertainment efforts, with a live-action Legend of Zelda movie also in the works and <a href="/news/638133/legend-of-zelda-movie-premiere-date-2027">due to release in March 2027</a>.</p></div>
