<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Four years after the company <a href="/2020/8/31/21402897/8bitdo-wireless-arcade-stick-nintendo-switch-pc-price">released its first wireless arcade-style controller</a>, 8BitDo is debuting a new version that&#8217;s almost one-third as thick as the original. Its new Arcade Controller managed to slim down by ditching the original&#8217;s joystick and focusing on only buttons in a unique layout. Often referred to as a leverless controller, or Hitbox after <a href="https://www.hitboxarcade.com/products/hit-box">the company that helped popularize this style</a>, 8BitDo&#8217;s includes a dynamic button layout that swaps labels at the turn of a dial.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The new 8BitDo Arcade Controller is available for preorder starting today for $89.99 and is expected to officially release on July 15th, 2025. The standard version is compatible with the Nintendo Switch and Windows PCs. 8BitDo also has an additional all-black version with adjustable glowing RGB accents that&#8217;s designed for the Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Windows, but it&#8217;s slightly more expensive at $99.99. However, both are much cheaper than competitors&#8217; offerings, including <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kitsune-All-Button-Arcade-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0CCX2DMXV?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Razer&#8217;s $300 Kitsune</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Leverless controllers may seem counterintuitive to those who&#8217;ve spent their lives gaming with analog joysticks or four-way directional pads, but they&#8217;re becoming popular among fans of fighting games where lightning-fast reaction times can sometimes be a deciding factor in who wins. Although it seems miniscule, playing with only buttons can eliminate the time it takes to move a joystick until an input is registered by a game, potentially giving a player a competitive advantage. At the same time, trying to aim in a fast-paced FPS game using four buttons will probably put you at a disadvantage, so this controller style isn&#8217;t for everyone.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Measuring in at 16mm thick, 8BitDo&#8217;s new Arcade Controller connects to the Switch over Bluetooth and to PCs using an included 2.4GHz USB dongle. For minimal latency, it can also connect to either with a USB-C cable. Its 1,000mAh rechargeable battery is enough for up to 20 hours of gameplay when using a wireless connection.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The controller&#8217;s 16 action buttons use Kailh Wizard low-profile mechanical switches out of the box, but you can swap those with alternative switches if you prefer a different feel. Four of the buttons, labeled P1 through P4, are programmable and utilize bean-shaped button caps to differentiate their feel. They can also be swapped out with included lie-flat alternatives, making them even easier to distinguish.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">A toggle switch flips the controller&#8217;s button layout between an S-Input mode for the Switch and X-Input mode for PCs, which also swaps the illuminated labels automatically. And as with many of 8BitDo&#8217;s recent gamepad releases, its new Arcade Controller supports the company&#8217;s Ultimate Software, which lets you customize the button mappings or make complex macros that can be assigned to its four programmable buttons.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The 8BitDo Arcade Controller for Xbox also has a few key differences (besides the all-black finish and glowing RGB accent lighting around 12 of its buttons). There&#8217;s no Bluetooth connectivity &#8212; only 2.4GHz or a USB cable &#8212; and the battery is quite a bit larger at 3,000mAh, which bumps wireless playtime to 20 hours with lighting on or 40 with it off.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Only P1 and P2 can be reprogrammed. It also doesn&#8217;t offer the ability to switch the layout of its buttons. Instead, the gamepad&#8217;s dial controls volume, which will help if you use the included headphone jack for streaming gameplay and chat audio to a wired headset.</p></div>
