<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google is launching a new version of its image generation model, called Imagen 4, and the company says that it offers &#8220;stunning quality&#8221; and &#8220;superior typography.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;Our latest Imagen model combines speed with precision to create stunning images,&#8221; Eli Collins, VP of product at Google Deepmind, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/generative-media-models-io-2025">says in a blog post</a>. &#8220;Imagen 4 has remarkable clarity in fine details like intricate fabrics, water droplets, and animal fur, and excels in both photorealistic and abstract styles.&#8221; Sample images from Google do show some impressive, realistic detail, like one showing a whale jumping out of the water and another of a chameleon.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The AI model is also &#8220;significantly better at spelling and typography,&#8221; which Collins says makes it easier to create greeting cards, posters, and comics. (When OpenAI recently added image generation <a href="/openai/635118/chatgpt-sora-ai-image-generation-chatgpt">to ChatGPT</a>, the company also touted its text rendering improvements, but it&#8217;s still <a href="/news/647356/chatgpt-ai-barbie-action-figure-viral-trend">susceptible to typos</a>.) </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In some images provided by Google, the text does look good &#8212; it&#8217;s perfectly legible in a short comic, for example, and even a tiny font in a mock stamp is readable. But we&#8217;ll have to see how the model&#8217;s text rendering capabilities hold up in the hands of regular users.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Imagen 4 will be available on May 20th in the Gemini app, Whisk, and Vertex AI, as well as in Slides, Vids, Docs, &#8220;and more in Workspace,&#8221; Collins says. Also, Google plans to launch a &#8220;fast variant&#8221; of Imagen 4 sometime &#8220;soon,&#8221; which it says is &#8220;up to 10x faster than Imagen 3.&#8221;</p></div>
