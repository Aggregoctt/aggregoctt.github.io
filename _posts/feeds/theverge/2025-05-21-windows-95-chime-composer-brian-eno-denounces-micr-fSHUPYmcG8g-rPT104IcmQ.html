<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Artist and musician Brian Eno &#8212; who also composed the iconic Windows 95 operating system startup chime &#8212; called on Microsoft today to &#8220;suspend all services that support any operations that contribute to violations of international law,&#8221; saying the company plays a role in &#8220;surveillance, violence, and destruction in Palestine.&#8221; It&#8217;s the latest high-profile instance of the tech giant being pressed on its contracts with the Israeli government.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;I gladly took on the [Windows 95] project as a creative challenge and enjoyed the interaction with my contacts at the company,&#8221; Eno wrote on Instagram. &#8220;I never would have believed that the same company could one day be implicated in the machinery of oppression and war.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The musician &#8212; who was a member of the influential rock band Roxy Music and has also had a long, storied solo career &#8212; specifically called out Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="/news/668322/microsoft-azure-ai-israel-military-contracts-gaza-protester-response">contracts with Israel&#8217;s Ministry of Defense</a>. Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/15/statement-technology-israel-gaza/">acknowledged</a> last week that it has contracts with the Israeli government for cloud and AI services, but claimed that an internal review conducted found &#8220;no evidence&#8221; that its tools were used to &#8220;target or harm people&#8221; in Gaza.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft has been taken to task in recent weeks over its business dealings with the Israeli government specifically. The outcry over Microsoft&#8217;s contracts with Israel relates to the ongoing bombardment of Gaza following Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7th, 2023. Human rights groups, including commissions at the United Nations, have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lnw2gvllxo">accused Israel of war crimes</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyr154314vo">genocidal acts</a> in its military operation that has killed thousands; as of this month, the Gaza Health Ministry reported more than 52,000 deaths, though <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/middle-east-and-africa/2025/05/08/how-many-people-have-died-in-gaza?utm_campaign=a.io&amp;utm_medium=audio.podcast.np&amp;utm_source=theintelligence&amp;utm_content=discovery.content.anonymous.tr_shownotes_na-na_article&amp;utm_term=sa.listeners">some researchers say</a> that number could be as high as 109,000 people.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Some of Microsoft&#8217;s fiercest critics are its own employees opposed to the company&#8217;s ties to Israel.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Earlier this week during Microsoft&#8217;s developer conference, multiple onstage events were disrupted, including CEO Satya Nadella&#8217;s keynote speech on Monday. During the event, <a href="/news/669362/microsoft-employee-protest-build-conference-satya-nadella">Microsoft employee Joe Lopez interrupted Nadella</a>, yelling, &#8220;How about you show Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?&#8221; The following day, a protester described only as a &#8220;Palestinian tech worker&#8221; <a href="/news/670812/microsoft-build-protest-keynote-jay-parikh-palestinian-tech-worker">disrupted another executive</a>&#8217;s presentation. On Wednesday, protesters disrupted a third session &#8212; and in the commotion, <a href="/news/671373/microsoft-ai-security-chief-walmart-conversation-build-protest-disruption">Microsoft inadvertently revealed</a> internal messages regarding Walmart&#8217;s use of AI.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In April, <a href="/news/643670/microsoft-employee-protest-50th-annivesary-ai">Microsoft employee Ibtihal Aboussad disrupted a 50th-anniversary event</a>, calling Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman &#8220;a war profiteer.&#8221; Another employee <a href="/news/643777/microsoft-bill-gates-steve-ballmer-satya-nadella-employee-protestor">disrupted a second Microsoft event</a> the same day. The acts of protest were organized by the <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/">No Azure for Apartheid</a> group, which calls for Microsoft to terminate contracts with the Israeli government and endorse a permanent ceasefire, among other demands. Aboussad was <a href="/news/644769/microsoft-fires-employee-protestor-war-profiteer">fired</a> from the company; the second protester, Vaniya Agrawal, was dismissed early after putting in her resignation.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Eno, a longtime critic of the Israeli government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/04/artists-censored-germany-palestinian-rights">who&#8217;s backed pro-Palestine efforts</a>, said on Instagram he would use his original earnings from the Windows 95 startup chime to help &#8220;the victims of the attacks on Gaza.&#8221;</p></div>
