<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Signal is <a href="https://signal.org/blog/signal-doesnt-recall/">taking proactive steps</a> to ensure Microsoft&#8217;s Recall feature can&#8217;t screen capture your secured chats, by rolling out a new version of the Signal for Windows 11 client that enables screen security by default. This is the same DRM that blocks users from easily screenshotting a Netflix show on their computer or phone, and using it here could cause problems for people who use accessibility features like screen readers.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">While Signal says it&#8217;s made the feature easy to disable, under Signal Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Screen Security, it never should&#8217;ve come to this. Developer Joshua Lund writes that operating system vendors like Microsoft &#8220;need to ensure that the developers of apps like Signal always have the necessary tools and options at their disposal to reject granting OS-level AI systems access to any sensitive information within their apps.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Despite delaying Recall <a href="/2024/10/31/24284572/microsoft-recall-delay-december-windows-insider-testing">twice before </a><a href="/news/656106/microsoft-recall-copilot-plus-pc-available">finally launching</a> it last month, the &#8220;photographic memory&#8221; feature doesn&#8217;t yet have an API for app developers to opt their users&#8217; sensitive content out of its AI-powered archives. It <a href="/2024/12/12/24319609/microsoft-recall-hands-on-notepad">could be useful</a> for finding emails or chats (including ones in Signal) using whatever you can remember, like a description of a picture you&#8217;ve received or a broad conversation topic, but it could also be a massive security and privacy problem.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Lund notes that Microsoft already filters out private or incognito browser window activity by default, and users who have a Copilot Plus PC with Recall <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/filtering-apps-websites-and-sensitive-information-in-recall-a4c28bee-e200-4a4a-b60d-c0522b404a5b">can filter out certain apps under the settings</a>, but only if they know how to do that. For now, Lund says that &#8220;Signal is using the tools that are available to us even though we recognize that there are many legitimate use cases where someone might need to take a screenshot.&#8221;</p></div>
