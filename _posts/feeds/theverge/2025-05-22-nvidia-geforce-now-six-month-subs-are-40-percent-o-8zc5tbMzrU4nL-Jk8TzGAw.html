<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you&#8217;ve been wanting to grab a subscription to Nvidia&#8217;s GeForce Now cloud game streaming service, now&#8217;s a good time to commit. That&#8217;s because six-month subs to its mid-tier Performance subscription &#8212; which offers ad-free 1440p gameplay, short queue times, plus ray-tracing on supported games &#8212; is 40 percent off. Instead of $49.99, you&#8217;ll pay <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce-now%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%252449.99%2520%2F%25206%2520months%2520after%2520promotion" rel="sponsored">$29.99</a>, a reasonable price if you don&#8217;t have a gaming PC, or just want a reliable way to play many (but <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce-now%2Fgames%2F" rel="sponsored">maybe not all</a>) of your Steam, Epic Games Store, and other titles away from your PC.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Each tier of GeForce Now offers different session lengths; the Performance tier caps you at six hours of playtime before freeing up your virtual machine for another player. However, you can simply start a new session immediately after. This deal will be active through July 6th, and after your six months are up, you&#8217;ll be charged the full price unless you cancel beforehand.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">This discount comes at an especially opportune time for Steam Deck owners, as the official GeForce Now should be <a href="/2025/1/6/24337977/nvidia-native-geforce-now-app-steam-deck-vr">launching soon for Valve&#8217;s handheld</a>, although an exact date hasn&#8217;t been publicly confirmed. Now, it might seem kind of redundant to play Steam games via the cloud when you can simply load them onto a Steam Deck&#8217;s storage, but Nvidia&#8217;s virtual machines are more powerful. You&#8217;ll be gaining visual fidelity not possible on the Deck, but adding some input latency &#8212; a given with any and all cloud game streaming services.</p></div>
