<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most convenient USB-C cables around is back down to its lowest price ever, which we last saw in early March. Anker’s 2-in-1, braided USB-C cable that can charge two devices from one power source is down to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRZ6JJ6D?th=1">$17.99</a> for the four-foot version at Amazon (it normally sells between $23 and $25.99). The cable also comes in a six-foot option that’s going for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGLJWBC6?th=1">$19.99</a>. Both sizes come in black or white.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So long as you have a power brick or portable battery that supports 140W charging (such as this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Nexode-Compatible-MacBook/dp/B0B129DM9T">Ugreen model</a>), Anker’s cable supports that speed when a single cable head is plugged in. This makes it fast enough to quickly charge some laptops, including some 16-inch MacBook Pro models, not to mention other, less power-hungry gadgets. In terms of how the cable decides how much juice each device gets with different power bricks and batteries, Anker has a chart <a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media-library-service-media/52c12ec2-9536-4081-9bfb-1116fbd9ca56.__CR0,0,2928,1200_PT0_SX1464_V1___.jpg">here</a> that breaks it down.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Other notable deals</h2>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Criterion is offering <strong><a href="https://www.criterion.com/">30 percent off all of its releases</a></strong>, including both new releases and preorders, through May 26. This gives you a chance to snag DVDs or 4K Blu-rays of your favorite (or soon-to-be favorite) films. Best Picture award-winning film <a href="https://www.criterion.com/films/34891-anora"><em>Anora</em></a> just released on April 29th. Alternatively, if you were captivated by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/film/661037/the-gang-is-back-together">recent trailer</a> for Spike Lee’s <em>Highest 2 Lowest</em>, featuring Denzel Washington, you should buy the 1963 Akira Kurosawa thriller <a href="https://www.criterion.com/films/543-high-and-low"><em>High and Low</em></a>, which the upcoming movie is based on.</li>
<li>Some PC gamers may be deciding between a new OLED gaming monitor with a 480Hz refresh rate versus one with a 240Hz refresh rate. Either route you choose to take will yield good deals today, as two 27-inch options are selling with discounts. The 27-inch 1440p <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMPTN8DG">LG 27GX790A-B</a> </strong>with a 480Hz refresh rate and DisplayPort 2.1 is down to $799.99 ($200 off) at Amazon, while opting for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alienware-QD-OLED-Gaming-Monitor-AW2725Q/dp/B0F148HG5M/"><strong>Alienware’s 4K AW2725Q</strong></a> — which halves the refresh rate — will run you just $30 more. Prefer a 32-inch curved 4K QD-OLED monitor with many of the same specs? <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-32-4k-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw3225qf/apd/210-blmq/monitors-monitor-accessories"><strong>Alienware’s 3225QF</strong></a> is down to $899.99 ($300 off) at Dell’s site.</li>
<li>You still have a week to grab a value-packed <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/xcom-complete"><strong>XCOM Steam PC game bundle</strong></a> at Humble. For $10, you can nab 17 items, comprising every major XCOM release as well as DLC. It’s worth it alone for <em>XCOM 2</em> and all of its stellar add-ons, but it’s also great to get the older titles, just to see how far the series has come. Proceeds benefit the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research.</li>
<li>Lastly, it’s not too common to find a great all-around 85-inch TV for $999.99. <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/tcl-85-q7-q-class-4k-uhd-hdr-qled-smart-tv-with-google-tv-2024/6579446.p"><strong>TCL’s Q7 4K QLED television with Google TV</strong></a> software is selling for that price at Best Buy ($700 off), and its HDMI 2.1 ports enable fast refresh rates from consoles and PCs alike. TCL claims that this specific size features more than 1,500 local dimming zones for dimming or illuminating scenes with accuracy (the more dimming zones, the better). That doesn’t compare favorably to Sony’s Bravia 9 QLED, which features around that many in its 65-inch version, but at less than half the price, TCL’s model isn’t a bad deal.</li>
