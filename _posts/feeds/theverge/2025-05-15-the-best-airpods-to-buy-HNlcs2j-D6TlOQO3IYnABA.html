<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Whether you&#8217;re buying your first pair of AirPods or replacing a well-used older pair, it&#8217;s easy to understand why so many iPhone owners prefer Apple&#8217;s earbuds and headphones over other options. Apple has spent years gradually adding new features that work best &#8212; and sometimes only work at all &#8212; within the company&#8217;s walled garden. These convenient tricks include audio sharing, automatic switching between Apple&#8217;s various devices, Apple TV integration, and more. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">There are four AirPods models to choose from, each with a distinct appeal and upside. You likely already know whether you&#8217;re more interested in earbuds or over-ear headphones, so that&#8217;s the first divide. In the case of headphones, your only choice is the AirPods Max. But in the earbuds category, Apple has three options: the AirPods Pro, AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation, and the plain old AirPods 4. </p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The best AirPods overall</h2><p class="_16zyrvq1">8</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple AirPods Pro (second-gen) with USB-C charging case</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 189</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 249</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">24 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 189</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Much better noise cancellation</li><li>Improved sound quality and clarity</li><li>Unrivaled hearing health features</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>Unchanged design</li><li>Sound is better but not top tier</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you want the earbuds that guarantee you&#8217;ll get the latest and greatest software features from Apple, the second-generation AirPods Pro should be at the top of your list. They offer the whole gamut of ecosystem exclusives. And if you&#8217;re the type of person to misplace things, you&#8217;ll be thankful that the earbuds&#8217; case has a U1 chip for pinpoint location finding. So whenever they go missing, you can track right where they are in the room using Apple&#8217;s Find My app.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The AirPods Pro deliver noise cancellation that&#8217;s effective at tamping down the volume of your surroundings in all but the most hectic environments. Their sound quality is on another level compared to the regular AirPods &#8212; helped in no small part by the in-ear seal you get from their silicone ear tips. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In 2024, Apple introduced three major hearing health features, including a hearing test, automatic hearing protection, and the option to use the AirPods Pro as clinical-grade <a href="/24275178/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aid-test-protection-preview">hearing aids</a> if you have mild or moderate hearing loss. No other AirPods (including the AirPods Max) offer this functionality, so it definitely sets the Pros apart. And the same can be said of their volume controls; you just swipe on the stems to raise or lower the loudness of your music, which is a handy advantage that the similar-looking AirPods 4 lack. </p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>The best if you don&#8217;t find ear tips comfortable</strong></h2><p class="_16zyrvq1">7</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple AirPods 4</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 119</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 130</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">8 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 119</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>Upgraded sound quality</li><li>Voice isolation can noticeably improve call clarity</li><li>Deep Apple ecosystem integration</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>No wireless charging</li><li>No built-in speaker on the case</li><li>No proper multipoint</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But not everyone likes the way ear tips feel. Even with venting and the other measures Apple has taken to improve comfort and reduce that clogged-up sensation, some people just prefer the regular, one-size-fits-most AirPods. Their open design means you&#8217;re never cut off from the outside world. The AirPods Pro have an impressive transparency mode, but the AirPods 4 don&#8217;t need to pipe in your surroundings; you can always hear what&#8217;s happening around you.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Apple sells two versions of the AirPods 4. No matter which you choose, you&#8217;ll get the same sound quality, microphone performance on voice calls, and IP54 water resistance. (The latter also applies to the AirPods Pro.) The more expensive pair features active noise cancellation and a more advanced charging case. You might be surprised by how well the noise cancellation works even with an unsealed design; it reduces office ambience and annoying hums, but louder sounds and voices still cut through the ANC. As for the case, the pricier AirPods 4 include wireless charging and Find My integration.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you&#8217;re really interested in noise-canceling earbuds, you should consider saving a bit more and stepping up to the AirPods Pro 2. They offer much better audio quality, stronger ANC, and a better experience. I&#8217;d only steer you to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">noise-canceling AirPods 4</a> if you&#8217;re really opposed to ear tips. </p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"><strong>The best for those who prefer headphones</strong></h2><p class="_16zyrvq1">8.5</p><p class="_16zyrvq2">Verge Score</p><h3 class="_18t3ez0j"><a class="_18t3ez0k" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJKT2X9?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AirPods Max (USB-C)</a></h3><span class="_18t3ez0s">$ 480</span><span class="_18t3ez0t">$ 549</span><span class="_18t3ez0u">13 % off</span><span class="_18t3ez0r">$ 480</span><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Good</h4><ul><li>High-luxury design</li><li>Terrific, balanced sound quality</li><li>Very effective noise cancellation</li><li>Dependable and foolproof controls</li><li>Spatial audio for immersive entertainment</li></ul><h4 class="_16zyrvq8">The Bad</h4><ul><li>Heavier than many competitors</li><li>No 3.5mm jack</li><li>Wired listening requires $35 cable</li><li>Case is an abomination</li><li>Lacks latest AirPods Pro features</li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">I&#8217;ve gone back and forth recommending Apple&#8217;s $549 AirPods Max over the last few years. They have a standout design, but the good looks and premium feel come at the cost of weight. These headphones are considerably heavier than most competitors and can get fatiguing over extended use. But Apple has also made smart choices: the fabric ear cups on the AirPods Max are much more pleasant in warm weather than the pleather you&#8217;ll find on Bose and Sony products, and won&#8217;t get your ears sweaty. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The AirPods Max provide impressive noise cancellation, and the transparency mode is clearer and more natural-sounding than any other set of headphones on the market. As for sound, Apple&#8217;s headphones have a pleasant sound signature that works well across a wide range of genres. They&#8217;re easy to listen to with an impressive soundstage for closed-back headphones. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">You lose some features &#8212; like conversation awareness and adaptive audio &#8212; that are included on the AirPods Pro; this is a side effect of the AirPods Max using Apple&#8217;s older H1 chip. But the company recently <a href="/news/642140/apple-airpods-max-lossless-audio-update-delay">added lossless audio over USB-C</a>, meaning these headphones offer the richest audio fidelity of the whole lineup. </p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">How we test AirPods</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1 kuxlcj7">We spend dozens of hours using AirPods products for our initial reviews, and that testing extends for weeks and months afterward. That&#8217;s where we assess sound quality, mic performance, and overall reliability. Where applicable, we try the active noise cancellation in a wide range of different environments and have put the hearing protection of the AirPods Pro through the paces at concerts. We also closely examine ecosystem benefits and how the AirPods and Apple&#8217;s other products work together.</p></div>
