<div><blockquote class="duet--article--blockquote ewrhy30 _1xwtict9"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Fellow Microsoft workers and Microsoft leadership, By now you may have seen or heard of my disruption at the Microsoft Build keynote this morning. I have been working as a firmware engineer under Azure Hardware Systems and Infrastructure (AHSI) for the past 4 years. As a Microsoft worker - while I&#8217;ve had positive experiences here, working and learning with many incredible people - I can no longer stand by in silence as Microsoft continues to facilitate Israel&#8217;s ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Like many of you, I have been watching the ongoing genocide in Gaza in horror. I have been shocked by the silence, inaction, and callousness of world leaders as Palestinian people are suffering, losing their lives and their homes while they plead for the rest of the world to pay attention and act.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Like many of you, I have tried to do my part in small ways. Staying informed, sharing information with friends, signing petitions, making donations. All the while continuing my work at Microsoft.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1"><strong>My disillusionment with Microsoft</strong></p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Then I came across the No Azure for Apartheid movement, whose members have been organizing, taking action, and speaking out no matter the cost. I saw Ibtihal and Vaniya&#8217;s disruption of Microsoft&#8217;s 50th anniversary on April 4 and was shocked to hear the words coming from their mouths. Microsoft is killing kids? Is my work killing kids?</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">I was also shocked by the silence of our leadership. By the silence of Mustafa Suleyman, Brad Smith, Kevin Scott, Scott Guthrie, and Satya Nadella. &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t they responding&#8221;? I asked myself. &#8220;If we are truly not guilty, shouldn&#8217;t they deny these horrible accusations?&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">I started to look deeper. I read the articles, saw the evidence, heard the testimonies of employees who were horrified to find out that the technology that we are building is being used by Israel in their mission to erase the Palestinian people.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">A switch had been flipped. Presented with this information, I went into work everyday plagued by thoughts of the suffering that is being inflicted by a United States-Israeli war machine that runs on Azure. I joined Microsoft because I truly believed that it was the &#8220;more ethical big tech&#8221;. I thought that the work that I was doing was empowering people, not causing harm.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1"><strong>Microsoft&#8217;s admission of complicity</strong></p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Microsoft recently uploaded a blog post, marking its first official response to the concerns that many have been shouting into their ears for years. Their statement falls far short of what we are demanding. Nontransparent audits into our cloud operations in Israel (conducted by no other than Microsoft itself and an unnamed external entity) that declare no wrongdoing by the company do not give me any sense of relief. In fact, this response has further compelled me to speak out. Microsoft openly admitted to allowing the Israel Ministry of Defense &#8220;special access to our technologies beyond the terms of our commercial agreements&#8221;. Do you really believe that this &#8220;special access&#8221; was allowed only once? What sort &#8220;special access&#8221; do they really need? And what are they doing with it?</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Leadership rejects our claims that Azure technology is being used to target or harm civilians in Gaza. Those of us who have been paying attention know that this is a bold-faced lie. Every byte of data that is stored on the cloud (much of it likely containing data obtained by illegal mass surveillance) can and will be used as justification to level cities and exterminate Palestinians. We don&#8217;t need an internal audit to know that a top Azure customer is committing crimes against humanity. We see it live on the internet every day.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">As one of the largest companies in the world, Microsoft has immeasurable power to do the right thing: demand an end to this senseless tragedy, or we will cease our technological support for Israel. If leadership continues to ignore this demand, I promise that it won&#8217;t go unnoticed. The world has already woken up to our complicity and is turning against us. The boycotts will increase and our image will continue to spiral into disrepair.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1"><strong>Call to action</strong></p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">My future children will one day ask me what I did for the Palestinian people as they were suffering and pleading for our help. I hope they will forgive me for my previous inaction. Many of you have children who may be asking you that question today. What will you tell them?</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">As Israel continues its deadly blockade of Gaza, and Netanyahu continues to assert that he will not rest until Gaza is fully occupied, we know that this situation is beyond dire. I wouldn&#8217;t have risked my career and my livelihood if I didn&#8217;t believe that to the core of my being. It&#8217;s terrifying to speak up, especially right now. Imagine your home being demolished as soldiers stand by cheering.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Your friends and family members dismembered by bombs that drop daily in your neighborhood.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Every member of your community on the brink of death due to starvation</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Strangers staking claims to your home, awaiting your death.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Wouldn&#8217;t you hope that someone would speak up for you?</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">I recognize my privilege as a young person with little financial responsibility to anyone but myself and little risk of deportation as a US citizen. Not everyone can afford to do what I did without great risk to themselves and their family. But no act is too small when human lives are at stake. Sign the petition, join the movement, start the conversation with colleagues, please contribute whatever you can to the cause.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">I know many of you out there are also considering leaving Microsoft for the same reasons I am. You are not alone. If you find it is too debilitating to work at this company and you wish to leave, please lean on our campaign to support. If we continue to remain silent, we will pay for that silence with our humanity.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Looking back, I&#8217;m ashamed of my past silence. But as the saying goes: &#8220;The best time to act was yesterday, the second best time is today.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Best,</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">Joe</p></blockquote></div>
