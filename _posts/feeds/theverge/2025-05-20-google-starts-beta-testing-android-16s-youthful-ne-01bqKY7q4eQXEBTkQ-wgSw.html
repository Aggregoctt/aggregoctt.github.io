With Android 16 expected to launch to everyone soon, it will be followed in the fall by this QPR1 update that adds the new visual touches. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Users with eligible Pixel devices, including ones as old as the Pixel 6 and up to the 9A, that are registered in the Beta program can get access to the new release as soon as it&#8217;s ready. However, if you&#8217;re already beta testing Android 16 but you&#8217;d rather wait to get the new design, you can opt out of this release on the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fandroid%2Fbeta" rel="sponsored">Android Beta website</a> (note: don&#8217;t install the system update afterward, as that will wipe your device &#8212; just wait for Android 16&#8217;s official launch).</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you want to try the redesigned Android 16 but are not currently enrolled in the beta, Google <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1krbabf/android_16_qpr1_beta_1_now_available/">posted instructions on Reddit</a> on how to get started:</p><blockquote class="duet--article--blockquote ewrhy30 _1xwtict9"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup ewrhy38 _1xwtict1">You can get started with Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 today by enrolling your Pixel device.
