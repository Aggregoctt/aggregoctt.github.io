<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">We Are Rewind, a Paris-based company that has <a href="/24295971/we-are-rewind-fiio-cassette-player-cd-dm-13">relaunched the cassette player</a> with <a href="https://www.wearerewind.com/products/lecteur-cassette-bluetooth-orange-serge">modern features</a> like support for wireless headphones and rechargeable batteries, has announced a larger boombox version. Streamlining the design of the portable stereos that were popular in the &#8216;80s, the &#8364;449 (around $500 USD) GB-001 can function as a Bluetooth speaker and stream audio from a mobile device. But its most appealing feature is its ability to play and record to cassettes, potentially reviving the mixtape for another generation.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The GB-001&#8217;s cassette deck mechanism features a user-adjustable motor with internal speed regulation for accurate playback. It also has a &#8220;noise reduction circuit&#8221; that emulates Dolby B so it can properly play tapes recorded using that older noise reduction system without any loss in sound quality. It can record on tapes, too, from external sources that include a wired microphone or a pair of mics connected wirelessly over Bluetooth.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The GB-001 has four speakers &#8212; two &#8220;powerful woofers for extended bass response&#8221; paired with two &#8220;soft dome tweeters for refined voices and treble.&#8221; We Are Rewind describes the GB-001 as having a &#8220;natural sound signature&#8221; so, unlike the boomboxes of the &#8216;80s, it&#8217;s not going to drown out lyrics with overpowering bass. And in keeping with current trends in audio gear, the GB-001 includes a &#8220;spatialisation function for a wider, more immersive stereo image.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">A rechargeable, user-replaceable 3,000mAh battery provides up to 10 hours of playback through the speakers when playing a tape, or up to 15 using an external audio source. That jumps up to 15 and 28 hours, respectively, when using headphones, but We Are Rewind didn&#8217;t specify if that&#8217;s through the 3.5-millimeter audio jack or Bluetooth.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Even if you&#8217;re not in need of its cassette capabilities, the design of the GB&#8211;001 still makes it an appealing alternative to Bluetooth speakers that <a href="/circuitbreaker/2017/3/27/15078522/disc-jock-e-bluetooth-waterproof-speaker">often look like beach toys</a>. It not only has a retro-looking folding carrying handle, it also sports a pair of functional analog VU meters that are backlit with a soft warm glow. For those of us who grew up enamored with the design of stereos from the &#8216;70s and &#8216;80s, the VU meters alone could help justify the splurge.</p></div>
