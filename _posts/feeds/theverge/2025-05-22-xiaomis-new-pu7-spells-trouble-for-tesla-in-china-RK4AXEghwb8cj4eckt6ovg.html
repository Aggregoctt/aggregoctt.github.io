<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Xiaomi unveiled its <a href="/2024/12/9/24317074/xiaomi-yu7-ev-suv-china-2025">hotly anticipated PU7 electric SUV</a> in China today, in the latest potential blow to Tesla&#8217;s position in <a href="/2023/8/30/23850923/tesla-china-ev-factory-competition-land-of-the-giants">the world&#8217;s hottest EV market</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mi.com%2Fglobal%2Fdiscover%2Farticle%3Fid%3D4925" rel="sponsored">The electronics giant says</a> the PU7 will get up to 518 miles of range on certain trims and accelerate from 0-62mph in just 3.23 seconds. The new EV, which is widely considered to be China&#8217;s version of the Apple car that ultimately <a href="/24085629/apple-car-dead-project-titan-ev-driverless-robotaxi">failed to materialize</a>, will be available for reservations starting in July.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The PU7 comes on the heels of the SU7, which has been a huge success for Xiaomi since deliveries began in March 2024. The company said it has sold over 200,000 SU7s as of April 2025, surpassing global EV sales for Ford and GM both.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But more importantly, the PU7 is being positioned as a direct competitor to the Tesla Model Y, which is Elon Musk&#8217;s company global best-seller. Xiaomi has been very clear about its intent to dethrone the Model Y in China. In response to Tesla&#8217;s refreshed Model Y, Xiaomi&#8217;s founder, chairman, and CEO Lei Jun responded by posting a size comparison between the two EVs. Yes, a literal EV measuring contest.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Like the SU7, the YU7 will come in three variants (<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/05/22/xiaomi-unveils-yu7-suv-gunning-for-tesla-model-y-in-china/">hat tip to Electrek</a> for the helpful chart):</p>YU7 variantPowertrainBattery chemistry/sizeRangePower0-100km/h accelerationStandardsingle RWDLFP/96.3 kWh835 km(519 miles)320 Ps(~316 hp)5.88 secProdual AWDLFP/96.3 kWh770 km(479 miles)496 Ps(~489 hp)4.27 secMaxdual AWDLithium ternary/101.7 kWh760 km(472 miles)690 Ps(~681 hp)3.23 sec<p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The PU7 has a lot more going for it, including its sleek, sports-car looks. The vehicle is comparable to the Model Y in size and acceleration, but demolishes Musk&#8217;s SUV in terms of range. In his presentation, Lei Jun said that range is the number one consideration for EV buyers, which led Xiaomi to develop an SUV that would be a class leader.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">On its website, Xiaomi described the Standard, single-motor PU7 as &#8220;the longest-range pure electric SUV with a sub-100 kWh battery and the top performer in the mid-to-large-size pure electric SUV category, achieving truly breakthrough range leadership.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Other notable features include a Nvidia Drive AGX Thor in-vehicle computing platform, active air suspension, and an 800-volt architecture &#8212; with a peak voltage of 897V &#8212; that can fast-charge from 10-80 percent in 12 minutes, as well as add 620 km (385 miles) of charge in just 15 minutes.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Of course, whether the PU7 will truly oust the Model Y from its perch will depend on its price &#8212; and we&#8217;re not getting that detail until closer to July 2025.</p></div>
