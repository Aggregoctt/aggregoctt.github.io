You use Command Palette to access Windows commands or launch command prompts and shell shortcuts. Command Palette also has the ability to quickly open websites, web searches, and search through folders and files like you&#8217;d expect from a Spotlight- or -Alfred-like interface.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft has also moved its previous Window Walker PowerToy into Command Palette so you can easily switch between open windows. The most interesting part about Command Palette is that Microsoft has made it fully customizable thanks to extensions support so you can add additional commands and features beyond what&#8217;s available by default.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The PowerToys Command Palette has been available since early April, and you can activate it using the Win+Alt+Space shortcut once it&#8217;s installed. Microsoft says &#8220;Command Palette is intended to be the successor of PowerToys Run,&#8221; but both are still available for now. Microsoft made some tweaks and changes to Command Palette this week ahead of its Build developer conference on May 19th.</p><h2 class="a18g6gh">Installer</h2><p class="a18g6gi">A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge&#8217;s universe.</p>Email (required)By submitting your email, you agree to our  <a href="https://www.voxmedia.com/legal/terms-of-use" class="a18g6g1l">Terms</a> and <a href="https://www.voxmedia.com/legal/privacy-notice" class="a18g6g1l">Privacy Notice</a>.
