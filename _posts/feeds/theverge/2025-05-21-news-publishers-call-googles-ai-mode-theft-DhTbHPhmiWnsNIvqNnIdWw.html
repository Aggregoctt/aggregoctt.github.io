<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The trade association backing some of the biggest news publishers in the US slammed Google&#8217;s newly expanded AI Mode, which trades traditional search results for an AI chatbot-like interface. In <a href="https://www.newsmediaalliance.org/google-ai-mode-statement/">a statement on Wednesday</a>, the News/Media Alliance said the new feature is &#8220;depriving&#8221; publishers of both traffic and revenue.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">During Google I/O on Tuesday, the company announced <a href="/google-io/670439/google-ai-mode-search-io-2025">that it&#8217;s expanding AI Mode to all users</a> in the US, which appears in a new tab directly within Search. When users enter a query, AI Mode serves up an AI-generated response alongside a list of relevant links. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;Links were the last redeeming quality of search that gave publishers traffic and revenue,&#8221; Danielle Coffey, the CEO and president of News/Media Alliance, said in the statement. &#8220;Now Google just takes content by force and uses it with no return, the definition of theft. The DOJ remedies must address this to prevent continued domination of the internet by one company.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">This week, an internal document disclosed as part of Google&#8217;s antitrust trial over its search dominance showed that the company <a href="/news/671711/google-ai-overviews-search-publisher-data-choice">decided against</a> asking publishers for permission to have their work included in its AI search features, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-19/google-gave-sites-little-choice-in-using-data-for-ai-search">as reported by Bloomberg</a>. Instead, publishers must opt out of search results completely if they don&#8217;t want their work included in AI features. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google Search head Liz Reid said during her testimony that allowing publishers to opt out of individual features would add &#8220;enormous complexity,&#8221; according to Bloomberg. &#8220;By saying a publisher could be like, &#8216;I want to be in this feature but not that feature,&#8217; it doesn&#8217;t work,&#8221; Reid said. &#8220;Because then we would essentially have to say, every single feature on the page needs a different model.&#8221;</p></div>
