<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">To potentially make it easier for users of streaming services like Spotify to switch, Apple Music has introduced a new built-in tool for importing libraries and playlists. A <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118249">support page added to Apple&#8217;s website this week</a> includes details on how to use the feature, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/apple-music-transfer-tool/">spotted by MacRumors</a>, but it also points out that it&#8217;s currently only available in Australia and New Zealand, with no details on when it might be available in more countries.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The transfer can be started from in the iPhone, iPad, and Android versions of the Apple Music mobile app, but also using the <a href="https://music.apple.com/">streaming service&#8217;s web interface</a>. &#8220;You can transfer your songs, albums, and playlists from other music services to Apple Music, but what you can transfer varies by service,&#8221; according to Apple&#8217;s support page. For example, you can only transfer playlists you created. &#8220;Playlists created by the music service won&#8217;t transfer.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The feature is available in the Apps &gt; Music section of iOS&#8217; and iPadOS&#8217; Settings app, or through the settings directly inside the Apple Music app on Android. Tapping &#8216;Transfer Music from Other Music Services&#8217; brings up a list of supported third party services, which will then require you to provide your login details before you&#8217;re given options of what you want transferred.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If an exact match for a song can&#8217;t automatically be found in the Apple Music catalog, you&#8217;ll be warned that &#8220;Some Music Needs Review&#8221; and will be prompted to select alternate versions to add to your library. You have just 30 days from when you started the transfer to review unmatched songs, and, according to Apple&#8217;s support page, you won&#8217;t be able to start a new transfer until the previous review is completed.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Apple partnered with the <a href="https://www.songshift.com/">creators of SongShift</a> for the new feature, but it&#8217;s still available as a standalone app since it also allows for library and playlist transfers between other streaming services including Spotify, Deezer, LastFM, Tidal, YouTube, and Pandora &#8211; not just to Apple Music.</p></div>
