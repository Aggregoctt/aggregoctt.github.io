<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">There&#8217;s still a week to go until Google I/O 2025 starts in earnest, but some of the developer conference&#8217;s biggest announcements are likely to arrive today in a one-off livestream called The Android Show: I/O Edition.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">When the Android Show will happen and where to watch it</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><a href="/news/656589/google-android-event-io-2025">The Android Show</a> takes place today, Tuesday, May 13th, at 10AM PT / 1PM ET. You can watch it live on the <a href="https://www.android.com/new-features-on-android/io-2025/">Android site</a> or its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3yDd3CmA_Y">YouTube channel</a>, and we&#8217;ve embedded the livestream at the top of this page too.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google&#8217;s main I/O keynotes tend to run for a couple of hours. Breaking Android out should mean this is a shorter show, though we don&#8217;t know for sure how long it&#8217;ll run.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">A new look for Android</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">One thing we&#8217;re pretty confident is coming is the launch of Android&#8217;s new design language, Material 3 Expressive. That&#8217;s because <a href="/news/661483/google-leak-material-3-expressive-android-design">Google already published</a> (and deleted) a blog post revealing the new look, and still has the name online in an <a href="https://io.google/2025/explore/technical-session-24">I/O session listing</a> that calls it &#8220;the future of Google&#8217;s UX design.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">We haven&#8217;t seen Material 3 Expressive in Android 16&#8217;s beta releases yet, so the Android Show should be our first detailed look at how it works, and hopefully we&#8217;ll find out when it &#8212; and Android 16 &#8212; will arrive on our phones.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Android XR</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google <a href="/2024/12/12/24319538/google-android-xr-ar-vr-smart-glasses">first announced</a> its Android-ified take on extended reality in December 2024, so we&#8217;re about due an update on it, especially with <a href="/2025/1/22/24349736/samsung-project-moohan-photos-android-xr-headset">Samsung&#8217;s Project Moohan headset</a> still slated to launch this year.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">We got to <a href="/2024/12/12/24319528/google-android-xr-samsung-project-moohan-smart-glasses">try the tech out last year</a>, so we know the basics of what to expect, but Google needs to prove that its concept is ready to become reality. Is a boatload of XR updates the reason it broke out the Android Show into its own event?</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Don&#8217;t hold your breath for hardware</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google is inconsistent about announcing hardware at Google I/O, but an announcement today feels especially unlikely: we already have the <a href="/phone-review/646135/google-pixel-9a-review-a-midrange-phone-done-right">Pixel 9A</a>, it&#8217;s too early for the <a href="/news/643123/google-pixel-10-leak-telephoto-camera-downgrade-main">Pixel 10 phones</a>, and by all accounts we&#8217;re <a href="/2024/11/21/24302508/google-pixel-tablet-2-canceled-rumor">never getting a Pixel Tablet 2</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Unless Google decides to drop a sneaky I/O tease of the Pixel 10 line &#8212; like it did for the <a href="/2022/5/11/23067073/google-pixel-7-pro-release-design-tensor">Pixel 7 series</a>, but hasn&#8217;t done since &#8212; the focus will probably be firmly on software.</p><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">When is the rest of Google I/O?</h2><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The bulk of <a href="/news/610508/google-i-o-2025-date">Google I/O</a> will take place next week, on May 20th and 21st, with Google&#8217;s main keynote set for 10AM PT / 1PM ET on May 20th. That&#8217;s right in the midst of <a href="/news/606387/microsoft-build-conference-may-19th-seattle">Microsoft&#8217;s Build conference</a>, which takes place from May 19th through May 22nd. With today all about Android, expect next week&#8217;s I/O event to put Gemini center-stage.</p></div>
