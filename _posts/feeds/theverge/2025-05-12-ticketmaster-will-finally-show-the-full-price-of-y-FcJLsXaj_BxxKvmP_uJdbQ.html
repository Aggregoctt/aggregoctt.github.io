<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, when you’re shopping for tickets, Ticketmaster will display a ticket’s full price, alongside a dropdown menu that you can select to see how much you’re paying for the “Face Value” of a ticket and the service fee. You still won’t see local taxes or delivery fees until checkout.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/15/23460279/taylor-swift-ticketmaster-the-eras-tour-concert-presale-crashed">the Taylor Swift ticketing catastrophe in 2022</a>, lawmakers and regulatory agencies have begun <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23762112/live-nation-ticketmaster-junk-fees-taylor-swift-eras-tour">paying closer attention</a> to Ticketmaster. Last year, the Department of Justice <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163083/live-nation-ticketmaster-doj-monopoly-lawsuit-break-up">sued Ticketmaster and its parent company</a>, Live Nation, accusing them of driving up prices as a result of their alleged monopoly.  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158227/house-passes-ticket-act-junk-fees-taylor-swift">The House also passed the TICKET Act</a> in 2024, a law that would force ticket sellers to show full prices upfront. It’s <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/us-house-passes-ticket-act-mandating-all-in-pricing-for-ticket-sales-heads-to-senate/">now headed to the Senate</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ticketmaster says it has made some improvements to its queue as well, by offering real-time updates about ticket availability and when wait times are expected to last more than 30 minutes. It also allows customers to see exactly how many people are ahead of them in the queue.</p>
