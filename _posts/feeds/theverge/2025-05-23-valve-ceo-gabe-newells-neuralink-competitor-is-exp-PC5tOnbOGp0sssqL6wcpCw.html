<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Valve co-founder and CEO Gabe Newell, the company behind Half-Life and DOTA 2 and Counter-Strike and preeminent PC game distribution platform Steam, has long toyed with the idea that your brain should be more connected to your PC. It <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014734/Biofeedback-in-Gameplay-How-Valve">began over a decade ago</a> with in-house psychologists studying people&#8217;s biological responses to video games; <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/13/2947088/valve-reveals-secret-hardware-project-wearable-computing">Valve once considered earlobe monitors</a> for its first VR headset. The company publicly explored the idea of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhj3C1H5JWo">brain-computer interfaces for gaming</a> at GDC in 2019.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But Newell decided to spin off the idea. That same year, <a href="/2024/4/9/24125379/is-gabe-newells-neuralink-competitor-coming-out-of-stealth">he quietly incorporated</a> a new brain-computer interface startup, Starfish Neuroscience &#8212; which has now revealed plans to produce its very first brain chip later this year.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><a href="https://starfishneuroscience.com/blog/ultra-low-power-miniature-electrophysiological-electronics/?header-bg=card-bg0">Starfish&#8217;s first blog post</a>, spotted <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1925459695713525986">by Valve watcher Brad Lynch</a>, makes it clear we&#8217;re not talking about a complete implant yet. This bit is the custom &#8220;electrophysiology&#8221; chip designed to record brain activity (like how Neuralink can &#8220;read your mind&#8221; so patients can interact with computers) and stimulate the brain (for disease therapy), but Starfish isn&#8217;t claiming it&#8217;s already built the systems to power it or the bits to stick it into a person&#8217;s head.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;We anticipate our first chips arriving in late 2025 and <strong>we are interested in finding collaborators for whom such a chip would open new and exciting avenues</strong>,&#8221; writes Starfish neuroengineer Nate Cermak (bolding theirs), suggesting that Starfish might wind up partnering with other companies for wireless power or even the final brain implant.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">But the goal, writes Starfish, is a smaller and less invasive implant than the competition, one that can &#8220;enable simultaneous access to multiple brain regions&#8221; instead of just one site, and one that doesn&#8217;t require a battery. Using just 1.1 milliwatts during &#8220;normal recording,&#8221; Starfish says it can work with wireless power transmission instead.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Here&#8217;s the chip&#8217;s current spec sheet:</p><ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1ymtmqpi _11h7yix0 _1xwtict1"><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Low power: 1.1 mW total power consumption during normal recording </span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Physically small: 2 x 4mm (0.3mm pitch BGA) </span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Capable of both recording (spikes and LFP) &amp; stimulation (biphasic pulses) </span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">32 electrode sites, 16 simultaneous recording channels at 18.75kHz </span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">1 current source for stimulating on arbitrary pairs of electrodes </span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Onboard impedance monitoring and stim voltage transient measurement </span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Digital onboard data processing and spike detection allows the device to operate via low-bandwidth wireless interfaces. </span></li><li class="_11h7yix1"><span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Fabricated in TSMC 55nm process</span></li></ul><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Neuralink&#8217;s N1, for comparison, has 1,024 electrodes across its 64 brain-implanted threads, <a href="http://whole%20ASIC%20consumes%20approximately%206%20mW">a chip that consumed around 6 milliwatts as of 2019</a>, a battery that periodically needs wireless charging, and the full implant (again, not just the chip) is around 23mm wide and 8mm thick. The Elon Musk-led company has reportedly already implanted it in three humans; while some of the <a href="/2024/5/9/24152758/neuralinks-first-implant-in-a-human-started-to-detach-from-the-patients-brain">threads did detach</a> from the first patient&#8217;s brain, he still has functionality and <a href="https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/full-q-and-a-neuralink-patient-noland">has been giving interviews</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Starfish says it could be important to connect to multiple parts of the brain simultaneously, instead of just one region, to address issues like Parkinson&#8217;s disease. &#8220;there is increasing evidence that a number of neurological disorders involve circuit-level dysfunction, in which the interactions between brain regions may be misregulated,&#8221; Cermak writes.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In addition to multiple simultaneous brain implants, <a href="https://starfishneuroscience.com/research/">the company&#8217;s updated website says</a> it&#8217;s working on a &#8220;precision hyperthermia device&#8221; to destroy tumors with targeted heat, and a brain-reading, robotically guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) system for addressing neurological conditions like bipolar disorder and depression.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In case you&#8217;re wondering how any of this might make its way back to gaming, I&#8217;ll leave you with Valve&#8217;s talk from GDC 2019 about brain-computer interfaces.</p></div>
