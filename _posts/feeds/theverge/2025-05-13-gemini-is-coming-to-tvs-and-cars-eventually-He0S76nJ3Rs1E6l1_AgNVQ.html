<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Google is bringing its Gemini AI assistant to devices with Google TV, cars with Android Auto and Google built-in, Wear OS smartwatches, and Android XR. But Google isn&#8217;t saying exactly when the AI assistant will come to those devices &#8212; right now, the company is giving more general timelines about when it might arrive.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">On Google TV products, &#8220;you can ask for action movies that are age-appropriate for your kids, and get the best recommendations,&#8221; according to <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/gemini-watches-cars-tvs-xr">a blog post from Guemmy Kim</a>, a senior director of product and user experience on Android. In an example, the company shows how you can ask something like &#8220;can you explain the solar system to my first grader,&#8221; and Google TV pulls up a short explanation, offers a button to press to learn more, and recommends YouTube videos about the solar system designed for kids. Gemini is coming to Google TV &#8220;later this year.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">In cars, Gemini will improve upon talking hands-free with Google Assistant by &#8220;understanding what you want while you&#8217;re driving, through natural conversations,&#8221; Kim says. &#8220;For example, Gemini can find you a charging station on the way to the post office that&#8217;s also near a park, so that you can go for a walk before your errands while your car is charging.&#8221; Gemini can also connect to a messaging app to summarize your messages. Gemini is coming to Android Auto &#8220;in the coming months,&#8221; and to cars with Google built-in sometime later.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">With Gemini on Wear OS, Kim highlights how the AI assistant lets you talk naturally, with &#8220;no need to get the words just right, or awkwardly type into a tiny screen,&#8221; which could be useful if you&#8217;re asking a quick question while dashing out the door to work. Gemini will launch on Wear OS in the coming months.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Finally, Gemini is coming to the first Android XR headset, built by Samsung. Kim says people will be able to try it later this year. </p></div>
