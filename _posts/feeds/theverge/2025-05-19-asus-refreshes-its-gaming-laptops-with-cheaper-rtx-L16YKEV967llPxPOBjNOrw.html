And with the 5060 becoming the new entry-level card for each line, the new configs can be around $300 to $400 cheaper than their 5070 versions. Prices on the new 5060 models are as low as $1,499.99 to slightly higher configurations (with faster CPUs, more RAM, and more storage) as pricey as $2,099.99.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">That low $1,499.99 and high $2,099.99 both lie in the ROG Strix G16. The Strix G16 and G18 look much like stripped-down versions of their pricier <a href="/2025/1/6/24336394/asus-rog-strix-scar-16-18-specs-price-ces-2025">Strix Scar</a> counterparts, with 16- and 18-inch 2560 x 1600 240Hz displays and the same wraparound RGB light bars built into their chassis. Though, the more simplified Strix G models have IPS panels instead of Mini LED, and no fancy lid with animated LEDs. The new RTX 5060-equipped G16 and G18 are offered with Intel (<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-core-200-non-ultra-cpus-may-be-rebranded-raptor-lake-alder-lake-chips-core-5-210h-spotted-with-slower-performance-than-the-core-i5-12450h">Raptor Lake Refresh</a> / <a href="/2025/1/6/24336355/intel-core-ultra-200-series-hx-h-u-processors-laptops-ces-2025">Arrow Lake</a>) and AMD (<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-quietly-announces-ryzen-8000hx-series-dragon-range-refresh-arrives-to-replace-amds-top-laptop-cpus">Dragon Range</a> / <a href="/2025/1/6/24337025/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-fire-range-9955hx3d">Fire Range</a>) chip options, 16GB or 32GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">As Strix laptops are bulky machines (weighing as much as seven pounds in the 18-inch model), they&#8217;re loaded with ports, including HDMI 2.1, ethernet, 3.5mm audio jack, five total USB ports for Intel models (three USB-A, one USB-C, and one Thunderbolt 4), and four total USB ports for AMD configs (two USB-A and two USB4).</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The new Asus TUF Gaming laptops also come in a variety of sizes and flavors, all now equipped with less costly RTX 5060 configurations than just their current RTX 5070 configurations. Like the Strix G models, the TUFs are fairly chunky gaming-focused laptops but they make some sacrifices for the sake of reaching certain price points, like lower 144Hz and 165Hz refresh rates and the TUF A18 having an ancient USB 2.0 plug among its five total USB ports. (Heresy, I know.)</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">At $1,599.99 there&#8217;s the 18-inch TUF A18 and 16-inch TUF F16. The A18 comes with an AMD Ryzen 7 260 (<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-launches-ryzen-ai-300-and-200-series-chips-for-laptops">Hawk Point</a>) CPU and the F16 has an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX (Arrow Lake). The TUF A14 and TUF A16 are next up at $1,699.99, with the 14-inch packing an AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 (the same Krackan Point chip I recently tested on the <a href="/reviews/650608/framework-laptop-13-review-2025-amd-ryzen-ai-300">Framework Laptop 13</a>) and the 16-inch getting the same Ryzen 7 260 as its bigger 18-inch sibling.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The simplest update is for Asus&#8217;s ROG Zephyrus G14 laptop, which is getting a $1,799.99 configuration with RTX 5060 graphics. The Zephyrus is Asus&#8217;s thinner gaming laptop that leans a little more towards the conventional, lending itself to traveling and not looking totally out of place in a cafe or library.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The laptop still looks as it did when the G14 was redesigned back in early 2024, with a 14-inch 2880 x 1800 120Hz OLED display, AMD Ryzen AI 9 270 CPU, 16GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, one USB4, one USB-C, two USB-A, HDMI 2.1, and a 3.5mm audio jack. Just as the recently refreshed models from CES using higher-end RTX 50-series GPUs, its USB-C ports got a tiny upgrade that allows you to use Power Delivery charging on either side. But, of course, if you want to get the most graphics power out of this compact gaming laptop you&#8217;ll have to plug in its hefty charger with reversible proprietary connector.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Since all of these laptops are equipped with the RTX 5060, they&#8217;re compatible with Nvidia&#8217;s DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation. While some models are available now through Asus&#8217;s online store and select retailers, the full availability of all configs is expected through June.</p></div>
