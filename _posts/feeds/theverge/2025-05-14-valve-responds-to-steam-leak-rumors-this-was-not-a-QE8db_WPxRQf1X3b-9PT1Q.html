BleepingComputer looked at 3,000 leaked files and found &#8220;historic SMS text messages with one-time passcodes for Steam, including the recipient&#8217;s phone number.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">While one X user <a href="https://x.com/MellowOnline1/status/1921682082025115818">claimed that there is</a> evidence tying the breach to Twilio, a Twilio spokesperson told BleepingComputer that &#8220;there is no evidence to suggest that Twilio was breached&#8221; and that &#8220;we have reviewed a sampling of the data found online, and see no indication that this data was obtained from Twilio.&#8221; Valve also told the X user that <a href="https://x.com/MellowOnline1/status/1922458687316074640">it does not use Twilio</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;The leak consisted of older text messages that included one-time codes that were only valid for 15-minute time frames and the phone numbers they were sent to,&#8221; Valve says in its post. &#8220;The leaked data did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data. Old text messages cannot be used to breach the security of your Steam account, and whenever a code is used to change your Steam email or password using SMS, you will receive a confirmation via email and/or Steam secure messages.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Valve adds that you don&#8217;t need to change your password or phone number following this leak, though it does recommend setting up the Steam Mobile Authenticator.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The company says it&#8217;s &#8220;still digging into the source of the leak.&#8221;</p></div>
