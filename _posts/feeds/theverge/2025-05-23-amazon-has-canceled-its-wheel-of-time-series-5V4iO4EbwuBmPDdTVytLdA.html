<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">After three seasons, Amazon&#8217;s live-action take on Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson&#8217;s <a href="/2021/11/16/22785109/amazon-wheel-of-time-tv-show-review-rosamund-pike-game-of-thrones">Wheel of Time</a> series is coming to an end.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Though <a href="/2024/12/8/24316339/wheel-of-time-season-3-streaming-premiere-amazon-prime-trailer-release-date">The Wheel of Time&#8217;s third season</a> was hailed by fans as the show&#8217;s strongest chapter yet, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/the-wheel-of-time-canceled-prime-video-1236409657/">Deadline</a> reports that Amazon has decided not to bring it back due to its relatively high production costs and flagging viewership numbers. Similar to Amazon&#8217;s Rings of Power series, The Wheel of Time was clearly a play to produce another Game of Thrones-style hit. When the series first debuted in 2021, it managed to capture an impressively large audience and become one of Amazon&#8217;s most-watched programs. But those numbers dwindled in subsequent seasons, leading Amazon to call it quits.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Speaking to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/wheel-of-time-finale-death-changes-rafe-judkins-interview-1236193225/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> back in April right after The Wheel of Time&#8217;s third season concluded, showrunner Rafe Judkins said that when when he and his team were first shopping the series around to studios, they ultimately chose Amazon as a production partner because it &#8220;felt like a place where they do want to invest in shows for the long term.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;There are not a lot of places doing that anymore,&#8221; Judkins said. &#8220;For Wheel of Time, it&#8217;s really important for us to be somewhere that does want to invest in shows for the long term and not just for the splash and leave.&#8221;</p></div>
