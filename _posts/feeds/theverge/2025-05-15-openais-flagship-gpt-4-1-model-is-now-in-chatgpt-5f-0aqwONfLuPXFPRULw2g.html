<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The latest versions of OpenAI&#8217;s multimodal GPT AI models are now rolling out to ChatGPT. <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1922707554745909391">OpenAI announced on Wednesday</a> that GPT-4.1 will be available across all paid ChatGPT account tiers and can now be accessed by Plus, Pro, or Team users under the model picker dropdown menu. Free users are excluded from the rollout, but OpenAI says that Enterprise and Edu users will get access &#8220;in the coming weeks.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><a href="/2024/7/18/24200714/openai-new-cheaper-smarter-model-gpt-4o-mini">GPT-4o mini</a>, the more affordable and efficiency-focused model that OpenAI launched last year, is also being replaced with GPT-4.1 mini as the default option in ChatGPT for all users, including free accounts. Users on paid accounts will also see GPT-4o mini replaced by GPT-4.1 mini in the model picker options. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"><a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-1/">Both GPT-4.1 and GPT&#8209;4.1 mini</a> are optimized for coding tasks and instruction following, and outperform GPT&#8209;4o and GPT&#8209;4o mini &#8220;across the board,&#8221; according to OpenAI. Both of the new models support a one million context token window &#8212; the amount of text, images, or videos in a prompt that an AI model can process &#8212; that greatly surpasses GPT-4o&#8217;s 128,000-token limit. OpenAI says that speed improvements also make GPT-4.1 more appealing for everyday coding tasks compared to the powerful <a href="/news/649941/openai-o3-o4-mini-model-images-reasoning">OpenAI o3 &amp; o4-mini reasoning models</a> it introduced in April.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1 mini were <a href="/news/647896/openai-chatgpt-gpt-4-1-mini-nano-launch-availability">made available to developers last month</a>, alongside the GPT-4.1 nano model, which OpenAI described as its &#8220;smallest, fastest, and cheapest&#8221; offering to date. GPT-4.1 Nano is absent from this model rollout announcement, and it&#8217;s unclear when &#8212; or if &#8212; it&#8217;ll be generally available in ChatGPT.</p></div>
