Their active noise cancellation comes close to matching the best from Bose and Sony, while their natural-sounding transparency mode makes it easy to stay aware of your surroundings without having to take them off to hear what&#8217;s going on.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">They&#8217;re also built to impress, with a stainless steel and aluminum design that feels as high-end as it looks, and is a step up from the mostly plastic builds of Apple&#8217;s rivals. We especially recommend them for those deeply embedded in Apple&#8217;s ecosystem, as they offer one-touch pairing, automatic device switching, spatial audio with head-tracking, and built-in Find My support &#8211; a combination of features you won&#8217;t find in any other pair of headphones.</p></div>
