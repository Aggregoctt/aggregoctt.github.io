<p>The wait is over — kind of. Apple’s iPhone 16 series is out, including the <em>kinda</em> affordable 16E, and its much-hyped Apple Intelligence has arrived courtesy of iOS 18.1. But if you’re expecting a new kind of iPhone experience, well, I have some bad news for you. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24279804/apple-intelligence-ios-18-1-siri-ai">AI features introduced in iOS 18.1</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24317119/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-chatgpt-genmoji">more</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/639849/apple-ios-18-4-intelligence-priority-notifications">recent</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/665066/ios-18-5-update-out-now-download-iphone-13-satellite">updates</a><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24279804/apple-intelligence-ios-18-1-siri-ai">,</a> including the writing tools and ChatGPT integration, are standard fare at this point. And although Siri has a new coat of paint, it’s basically the same old Siri.</p>
<p>Apple has promised much more, but the Apple Intelligence rollout is going to be a slow burn that lasts well into 2025. This is all to say that if you don’t have any complaints about how your current phone is working, you definitely shouldn’t rush out and get a new one just for Apple Intelligence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content">There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content">The most expensive, souped-up iPhone isn’t automatically the best one for everyone. What I look for is a happy medium — features that will satisfy most people at the best price. Sometimes, that’s last year’s model.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content">Battery performance can vary by a significant margin between current iPhone models, mostly down to the size of the phone. Everyone wants a phone that can last a full day, and these recommendations reflect that.</p>

</div></div>
</div></div>
<p>That’s actually the gist of our phone buying philosophy: hang on to the one you’ve got. If you’re not the type of person to get excited about a new camera button, updated photo processing options, or incremental performance upgrades, then there’s no reason to run out and buy an iPhone 16.</p>
<p>But if you’re questioning whether it’s the year to replace your iPhone 11 or 12 (or you’re concerned about a price increase as a result of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">current tariff situation</a>), then I think the answer is an easy yes. There are real gains this time around, especially in the basic iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, without even considering AI. And if Apple Intelligence turns out to be something special eventually, well, you’ll be ready for it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="27uLV9">The best iPhone for most people</h2>
<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.1-inch, 2556 x 1179 OLED, 60Hz refresh rate / <strong>Processor:</strong> A18 <strong>Cameras:</strong> 48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery: </strong>Not advertised / <strong>Charging:</strong> 27W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe, 15W Qi2, 7.5W Qi / <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> IP68</em></em></p>
<p>Apple’s basic iPhone enjoyed a significant hardware boost this time around, playing an overdue game of catch-up to the Pro series. The iPhone 16 includes the Action Button from last year’s Pro models — handy if there’s an app in your life you want to access at the touch of a button — and the new Camera Control. So if buttons are anything to go by, this phone is <em>two better</em> than the last-gen model.</p>
<p>There’s more going on under the hood, too. The A18 chipset is in the same generation as the processor on the Pro models, which hasn’t been the case for the past couple of years. That bodes well for the 16 series staying on the same update schedule. And there’s extra RAM in this year’s base model, which can only be a good thing.</p>
<img alt="iPhone 16 Plus and iPhone 16" src="/assets/media/I9gjEOnF5SZq7wERgMWPNA-dhb4CuHOh5XxLoAd69EoyQ.webp" title="iPhone 16 Plus and iPhone 16"/>
<p>The iPhone 16 became a much more interesting camera this time around, too. The Camera Control offers a quick way to launch the camera app and adjust settings like exposure compensation. But there’s also a new set of Photographic Style filters this time around, with options to adjust contrast, brightness, and undertones to dial in your preferred rendering of skin tones. You’ll get better low-light performance by stepping up to the 16 Pro models, and other cool tricks like 4K recording at 120 fps. But even without all that, it’s the most customizable camera Apple has offered yet.</p>
<p>Outside of camera performance, there are two major drawbacks to picking the regular 16 over a Pro model: no zoom lens, and no ProMotion screen. Only the Pro has a dedicated 5x lens, which is handy for creative framing. And the standard 60Hz screen on the iPhone 16 will likely only bother you if you’re used to a smoother 120Hz display, though it’s annoying on principle that Apple keeps this feature to its Pro phones when virtually every other high-end phone has one.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dVg1gf">The best high-end iPhone</h2>
<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.3-inch, 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / <strong>Processor:</strong> A18 Pro <strong>Cameras:</strong> 48-megapixel f/1.8 with sensor-shift IS; 12-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery: </strong>Not advertised / <strong>Charging:</strong> 27W wired, 25W MagSafe wireless, 15W Qi2, 7.5W Qi / <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> IP68</em></em></p>
<p>The iPhone 16 Pro gets a small but meaningful upgrade this time around: a bump up to a 5x zoom, which on the 15 series was reserved for the Pro Max. And while the change from a 3x to 5x zoom doesn’t look that impressive on paper, it goes a long way to making the smaller 16 Pro feel like an equal to the 16 Pro Max. For once, you don’t need to get the biggest phone to get the best phone.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>The 16 Pro is roughly the same size as the 15 Pro, but it has a bigger screen: 6.3 inches, up from 6.1 inches. There’s also the new Camera Control, an upgraded 48-megapixel ultrawide on board, and naturally, a new chipset that — naturally — supports Apple Intelligence.</p>

<p>There’s nothing here that makes the 16 Pro an absolute must-upgrade. Still, plenty of people will want the latest device with all the bells and whistles, and the 16 Pro represents an opportunity to get all of those features without having to buy the biggest phone.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="OF6PPh">The iPhone with the best battery life</h2>
<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.7-inch Super Retina OLED / <strong>Processor:</strong> A18 <strong>Cameras:</strong> 48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery: </strong>Not advertised / <strong>Charging:</strong> 27W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe, 15W Qi2, 7.5W Qi / <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> IP68</em></em></p>
<p>The thing about a big phone is that it has a big battery. And while that’s easy enough to understand, it still feels surprising how much more performance you can eke out of the iPhone 16 Plus’ battery. It’ll stretch well into a second day of use, and even if you’re conditioned to charge your phone every night, you’ll be amazed at how much you have left in the tank at the end of each day. It’s a solid antidote to battery anxiety.</p>
<img alt="iPhone 16 in blue and iPhone 16 Plus in pink." src="/assets/media/I9gjEOnF5SZq7wERgMWPNA-tAtMYpTp-bM0n__-TYJcCQ.webp" title="iPhone 16 in blue and iPhone 16 Plus in pink."/>
<p>Naturally, the 16 Plus’ big-ness comes with another bonus: a bigger screen. The benefits are obvious here, too. But something that stands out to me when I use the phone is just how light it feels for its size, especially if you’re comparing it to the 16 Pro Max. If you like a big display but don’t need all of the weight of the Max — metaphorically and physically speaking — then the Plus is the way to go.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="oB7T9T">The best inexpensive-ish iPhone</h2>
<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.1-inch Super Retina XDR / <strong>Processor:</strong> A18 <strong>Cameras:</strong> 48MP Fusion</em></em> with 1x and 2x optical zoom, 12-megapixel selfie<em><em> / <strong>Battery: </strong>Not advertised / <strong>Charging:</strong> 20-watt wired, <em><em>7.5W Qi</em></em></em></em>, no MagSafe<em><em>/ <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> IP68</em></em></p>
<p>This recommendation comes with a heavy sigh. Yes, the 16E is the cheapest new iPhone Apple sells. Yes, it’s a good phone. It has a capable camera, reliable performance, full water resistance, wireless charging, and will be supported with software updates for years to come. But its $599 price tag starts to feel like too much when you consider what it’s missing. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no MagSafe, which you can kind of add by way of a MagSafe case, but it’s a bummer not to have it built in when it has basically become a standard iPhone feature. There’s no ultrawide camera, no Dynamic Island housing timely information, no camera control (not a huge loss, honestly), and no Ultra Wideband for precise object tracking. It does support Apple Intelligence, but that doesn’t feel like much of a consolation, given that it’s very much a work in progress.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The 16E will most likely receive more years of software support than a previous-gen model like the iPhone 14 or 15. And sure, Apple Intelligence might turn into something useful someday. The 16E is a good choice if you want the path of least resistance to blue bubbles and FaceTime at your fingertips. But if you’d like MagSafe, a more advanced camera, and some of the other bells and whistles that got lost on the way to the 16E, then it’s not a bad idea to look at one of the older iPhones.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4PDv5T">What about the iPhone 15?</h2>
<p>Apple still sells <a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/1141873/2154171/7613?subId1=verge100124&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-15"><strong>the iPhone 15</strong></a> new, cutting the price down to $699 with the introduction of the 16 series. There’s a strong argument for buying a 15 rather than the 16E if you don’t care about Apple Intelligence; the 15 Pro runs Apple Intelligence while the regular 15 doesn’t. Compared to the 16E, the iPhone 15 includes MagSafe, the Dynamic Island, an ultra wideband chip for precise item tracking, and an ultrawide camera. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, May 12th: </strong>Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and the rollout of more recent iOS updates.</em></p>
