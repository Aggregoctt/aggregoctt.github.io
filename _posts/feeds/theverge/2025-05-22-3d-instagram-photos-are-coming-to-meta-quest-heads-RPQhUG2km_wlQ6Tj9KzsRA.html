excerpt: Meta is beginning to test showing 3D photos on Instagram if you’re looking
  at your feed on a Meta Quest VR headset. “Thanks to our AI view synthesis algorithms,
  we can transform the existing photos that show up in Instagram feed pixel by pixel
  – no fancy 3D cameras required,” Meta says in a blog [&#8230;]

<div><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Meta is beginning to test showing 3D photos on Instagram if you&#8217;re looking at your feed on a Meta Quest VR headset.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">&#8220;Thanks to our AI view synthesis algorithms, we can transform the existing photos that show up in Instagram feed pixel by pixel &#8211; no fancy 3D cameras required,&#8221; Meta says <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/instagram-3d-photos-spatial-medianavigator-meta-quest-test/">in a blog post</a>. &#8220;That means flat photos that weren&#8217;t originally captured in 3D will automatically be converted into an immersive format that gives 2D images a sense of depth when you view them on Quest.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The test starts this week. &#8220;Not everyone will have access to 3D Instagram photos on Quest &#8211; and even if you&#8217;re in the test group, you may not see it right away,&#8221; Meta says. And it&#8217;s not the first time Meta has dabbled with 3D photos; the company rolled out a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/iphone-app/414295416095269">3D photo feature</a> for Facebook <a href="/2018/10/11/17964686/facebook-3d-photos-dual-camera-depth-pictures-rollout">in 2018</a>. </p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The test of 3D photos in Instagram is being introduced as part of Meta Quest&#8217;s v77 update, which includes a bunch of other features. One notable one, also in testing, is Navigator, which Meta describes as &#8220;a new home for your games and apps, friends, notifications, essential system settings, and more on Quest.&#8221;</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">You&#8217;ll get to the Navigator by pressing the Meta or Oculus button on the right controller. It offers access to recently-used apps, and you can pin up to 10 items to make them easier to get to. Meta has more information about Navigator in a video <a href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/133727602066940/">on its website</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The v77 update also adds experimental support for Bluetooth Low Energy audio devices, lets you select a window that can follow you as you move, and combines the Meta Quest Link, casting, and remote desktop into a single PC app, <a href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/1517439565442928/">Horizon for PC</a>.</p></div>
