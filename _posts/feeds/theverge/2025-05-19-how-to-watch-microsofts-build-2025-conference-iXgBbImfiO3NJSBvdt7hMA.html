Build will be focused on Microsoft&#8217;s latest platform changes for developers, including new AI announcements that are bound to go head-to-head with Google&#8217;s own news.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Microsoft is streaming Build online free of charge and developers, students, and engineers will also be able to attend the in-person event at Seattle&#8217;s conference center. I&#8217;m expecting Microsoft to focus largely on AI this year, with emphasis on its <a href="/2024/5/21/24158030/microsoft-copilot-ai-automation-agents">push for AI agents</a> that Microsoft envisions working alongside humans as digital colleagues.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">We may also get some news on Microsoft&#8217;s plans to host Elon Musk&#8217;s Grok AI model. <a href="/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/659535/microsoft-elon-musk-grok-ai-azure-ai-foundry-notepad">I revealed in my Notepad newsletter</a> earlier this month that Microsoft is in discussions with xAI to host the Grok AI model on its Azure AI Foundry service, with a potential announcement at Build this week.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Perhaps we&#8217;ll also see OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appear at Build, <a href="/2024/5/21/24161734/sam-altman-to-appear-at-microsoft-build">just like he did last year</a>. In Notepad earlier this year I revealed that OpenAI had been planning to <a href="/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/616464/microsoft-prepares-for-openais-gpt-5-model">launch its GPT-5 model in late May</a>, but sources familiar with OpenAI&#8217;s plans tell me that&#8217;s less likely now due to service changes and recent delays affecting the launch of other models. Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella are always keen to show that the partnership between the two companies remains strong &#8212; amid media reports of tensions &#8212; with the pair <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1918014405515853833">posing for a selfie</a> earlier this month.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Nadella will kick off all of Microsoft&#8217;s AI announcements at 9AM PT / 12PM ET on May 19th, followed by a day two technical keynote hosted by Jay Parikh, Charles Lamanna, and Scott Guthrie.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">If you want to attend any sessions, <a href="https://register.build.microsoft.com/">then register for free here</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">The keynote for Microsoft Build 2025 will start at 9AM PT / 12PM ET on May 19th.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Catch the keynote and the sessions <a href="https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/home">here on the Microsoft Build 2025 page</a>.</p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1">Stay tuned to The Verge for all the news coming out of the conference!</p></div>
