excerpt: Microsoft is shutting off access to its Bing Search results for third-party
  developers. The software maker quietly announced the change earlier this week, noting
  that Bing Search APIs will be retired on August 11th and that â€œany existing instances
  of Bing Search APIs will be decommissioned completely, and the product will no longer
  be available [&#8230;]
