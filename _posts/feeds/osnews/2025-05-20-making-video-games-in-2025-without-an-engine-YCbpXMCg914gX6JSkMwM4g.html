excerpt: I genuinely believe making games without a big &#8220;do everything&#8221;
  engine can be easier, more fun, and often less overhead. I am not making a &#8220;do
  everything&#8221; game and I do not need 90% of the features these engines provide.
  I am very particular about how my games feel and look, and how I interact with my
  tools. I often find the default feature implementations in large engines like Unity
  so lacking I end up writing my own anyway. Eventually, my projects end up being
  mostly my own tools and systems, and the engine becomes just a vehicle for a nice
  UI and some rendering&#8230; At which point, why am I using this engine? What is
  it providing me? Why am I letting a tool potentially destroy my ability to work
  when they suddenly make unethical and terrible business decisions? Or push out an
  update that they require to run my game on consoles, that also happens to break
  an entire system in my game, forcing me to rewrite it? Why am I fighting this thing
  daily for what essentially becomes a glorified asset loader and editor UI framework,
  by the time I&#8217;m done working around their default systems? â†« Noel Berry Interesting
  and definitely unique perspective, as I feel most game developers just pick one
  of the existing big engines and work from there. I&#8217;m not saying either option
  is wrong, but I do feel like the dependence on the popular engines can potentially
  harm the game industry as a whole, as it reduced diversity, drains valuable knowledge
  and expertise, and leaves developers &#8211; especially smaller ones &#8211; at
  the mercy of a few big players. Perhaps not every game needs to be made in Unity
  or Unreal.
