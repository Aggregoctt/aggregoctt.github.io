excerpt: I generally don&#8217;t pay attention to the releases of programming languages
  unless they&#8217;re notable for some reason or another, and I think this one qualifies.
  Rust is celebrating its ten year anniversary with a brand new release, Rust 1.87.0.
  This release adds anonymous pipes to the standard library, inline assembly can now
  jump to labeled blocks in Rust code, and support for the i586 Windows target has
  been removed. Considering Windows 7 was the last Windows version to support i586,
  I&#8217;d say this is fair. You can update to the new version using the rustup command,
  or wait until your operating system adds it to its repository if you&#8217;re using
  a modern operating system.
