excerpt: This article isn’t meant to be technical. Instead, it offers a high-level
  view of what happened through the years with GhostBSD, where the project stands
  today, and where we want to take it next. As you may know, GhostBSD is a user-friendly
  desktop BSD operating system built with FreeBSD. Its mission is to deliver a simple,
  stable, and accessible desktop experience for users who want FreeBSD’s power without
  the complexity of manual setup. I started this journey as a non-technical user.
  I dreamed of a BSD that anyone could use. ↫ Eric Turgeon at the FreeBSD Foundation&#8217;s
  website I&#8217;m very glad to see this article published on the website of the
  FreeBSD Foundation. I firmly believe that especially FreeBSD has all the components
  to become an excellent desktop alternative to desktop Linux distributions, especially
  now that the Linux world is moving fast with certain features and components not
  everyone likes. FreeBSD could serve as a valid alternative. GhostBSD plays an important
  role in this. It offers not just an easily installable FreeBSD desktop, but also
  several tools to make managing such an installation easier, like in-house graphical
  user interfaces for managing Wi-Fi and other networks, backups, updates, installing
  software, and more. They also recently moved from UFS to ZFS, and intend to develop
  graphical tools to expose ZFS&#8217;s features to users. GhostBSD can always use
  more contributors, so if you have the skills, interest, and time, do give it a go.
