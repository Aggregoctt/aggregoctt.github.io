excerpt: We&#8217;re looking at an article from 2007 here, but I still think it&#8217;s
  valuable and interesting, especially from a historical perspective. I first started
  working on the UNIX file system with Bill Joy in the late 1970s. I wrote the Fast
  File System, now called UFS, in the early 1980s. In this article, I have written
  a survey of the work that I and others have done to improve the BSD file systems.
  Much of this research has been incorporated into other file systems. â†« Marshall
  Kirk McKusic Variants of UFS are still the default file system in at least NetBSD
  and OpenBSD, and it&#8217;s one of the two default options in FreeBSD (alongside
  ZFS). In other words, this article, and the work described therein, is still relevant
  to this very day.
