excerpt: 'John Siracusa, one third of the excellent ATP podcast, developer of several
  niche Mac utilities, and author of some of the best operating system reviews of
  all time, has called for Apple&#8217;s CEO, Tim Cook, to step down. Now, countless
  people call for Tim Cook to stand down all the time, but when someone like Siracusa,
  an ardent Mac user since the release of the very first Macintosh and a staple of
  the Apple community, makes such a call, it carries a bit more weight. His main argument
  is not particularly surprising to anyone who&#8217;s been keeping tabs on the Apple
  community, and the Apple developer community in particular: Apple seems to no longer
  focus on making great products, but on making money. Every decision made by Apple&#8217;s
  leadership team is focused solely on extracting as much money from consumers and
  developers, instead of on making the best possible products. The best leaders can
  change their minds in response to new information. The best leaders can be persuaded.
  But we’ve had decades of strife, lawsuits, and regulations, and Apple has stubbornly
  dug in its heels even further at every turn. It seems clear that there’s only one
  way to get a different result. In every healthy entity, whether it’s an organization,
  an institution, or an organism, the old is replaced by the new: CEOs, sovereigns,
  or cells. It’s time for new leadership at Apple. The road we’re on now does not
  lead anywhere good for Apple or its customers. It’s springtime, and I’m choosing
  to believe in new life. I swear it’s not too late. ↫ John Siracusa I reached this
  same point with Apple a long, long time ago. I was an ardent Mac user during the
  PowerPC G4 and G5 days, lasting into the early Intel days. However, as the iPhone
  and related services took over as Apple&#8217;s primary source of income, I felt
  that Mac OS X, which I once loved and enjoyed so much, started to languish, and
  it&#8217;s been downhill for Apple&#8217;s desktop operating system ever since.
  Whenever I have to help my parents with their computers &#8211; modern M1 and M2
  Macs &#8211; I am baffled and saddened by just how big of a convoluted, disjointed,
  and unintuitive mess macOS has become. I long ago stopped caring about whatever
  products Apple releases or updates, because I feel like as a user who genuinely
  cares about his computing experience, Apple simply doesn&#8217;t make products for
  me. I&#8217;m not sure replacing Tim Cook with someone else will really change anything
  about Apple&#8217;s priorities; in the end, it&#8217;s a publicly traded corporation
  that thinks it needs to please shareholders, and a focus on great products instead
  of money isn&#8217;t going to help with that. Apple long ago stopped being the beleaguered
  company many of its most ardent fans still seem convinced that it is, and it&#8217;s
  now one of those corporate monoliths that can make billions more overnight by squeezing
  just a bit more out of developers or users, regardless of what that squeezing does
  to the user experience. Apple is still selling more devices than ever, and it&#8217;s
  still raking in more gambling gains through digital slot machines for children,
  and as long as that&#8217;s the case, replacing Tim Cook won&#8217;t do a goddamn
  thing.'
