excerpt: Tuxguitar is a quite powerful application written in a mixture of Java /
  C. It is able to render a score in real time either via Fluidsynth or via pure MIDI.
  The development of Tuxguitar started in 2008 on Sourceforce and after a halt in
  2022, the project restarted on Github and is still actively developed. The goal
  of this article is to try to render a score via Tuxguitar, and various other applications
  connected to Tuxguitar, via Jack or Pipewire-Jack. The score used throughout this
  article will be The Pursuit Of Vikings by the band Amon Amarth. It has 2 guitars,
  a bass and a drum track. â†« Yann Collette at Fedora Magazine If you&#8217;re into
  audio production and are considering using Linux for your audio needs, this article
  is a good starting point.
