excerpt: Jwno is a highly customizable tiling window manager for Windows 10/11, built
  with Janet and ❤️. It brings to your desktop magical parentheses power, which, I
  assure you, is not suspicious at all, and totally controllable. ↫ Jwno documentation
  Yes, it&#8217;s a Lisp system, so open your bag of spare parentheses and start configuring
  and customising it, because you&#8217;re going to need it if you want to use Jwno
  to its fullest. In general, Jwno works as a keyboard driven tiling window manager.
  When a new window shows up, it tries to transform the window so it fits in the layout
  you defined. You can then use customized key bindings to modify the layout or manipulate
  your windows, rather than drag things around using the mouse. But, since a powerful
  generic scripting engine is built-in, you can literally do anything with it. ↫ Jwno
  documentation It&#8217;s incredibly lightweight, comes as a single executable, integrates
  perfectly with Windows&#8217; native virtual desktop and window management features,
  has support for REPL, and much more.
