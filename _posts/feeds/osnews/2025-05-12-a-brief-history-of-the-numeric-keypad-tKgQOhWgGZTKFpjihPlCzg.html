excerpt: The title is a lie. This isn&#8217;t brief at all. Picture the keypad of
  a telephone and calculator side by side. Can you see the subtle difference between
  the two without resorting to your smartphone? Don’t worry if you can’t recall the
  design. Most of us are so used to accepting the common interfaces that we tend to
  overlook the calculator’s inverted key sequence. A calculator has the 7–8–9 buttons
  at the top whereas a phone uses the 1–2–3 format. Subtle, but puzzling since they
  serve the same functional goal — input numbers. There’s no logical reason for the
  inversion if a user operates the interface in the same way. Common sense suggests
  the reason should be technological constraints. Maybe it’s due to a patent battle
  between the inventors. Some people may theorize it’s ergonomics. With no clear explanation,
  I knew history and the evolution of these devices would provide the answer. Which
  device was invented first? Which keypad influenced the other? Most importantly,
  who invented the keypad in the first place? ↫ Francesco Bertelli and Manoel do Amara
  Sometimes, you come across articles that are one-of-a-kind, and this is one of them.
  Very few people would go to this length to document such a particular thing most
  people find utterly insignificant, but luckily for us, Francesco Bertelli and Manoel
  do Amara went all the way with this one. If you want to know anything about the
  history of the numerical pad and its possibly layouts, this is the place to go.
  What I&#8217;ve always found fascinating about numerical pads is how effortless
  the brain can switch between the two most common layouts without really batting
  an eye. Both layouts seem so ingrained in my brain that it feels like there&#8217;s
  barely any context-switching involved, and my fingers just effortlessly flow to
  the correct numbers. Considering numbers tend to confuse me, I wouldn&#8217;t have
  been at all surprised to find myself having issues switching between the two layouts.
  What makes this even more interesting is when I consider the number row on the keyboard
  &#8211; you know, 1 through 0 &#8211; because there I do tend to have a lot of issues
  finding the right numbers. I don&#8217;t mean it takes seconds or anything like
  that, but I definitely experience more hiccups working with the number row than
  with a numerical keypad of either layout.
