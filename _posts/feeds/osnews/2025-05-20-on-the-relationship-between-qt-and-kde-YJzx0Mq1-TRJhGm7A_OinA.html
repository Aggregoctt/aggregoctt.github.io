excerpt: Volker Hilsheimer, chief maintainer of the Qt project, says he has learned
  lessons from the painful Qt 5 to Qt 6 transition, the importance of Qt Bridges for
  using Qt from any language, and the significance of the relationship with the Linux
  KDE desktop. â†« Tim Anderson at Dev Class Qt plays a significant role in the open
  source desktop world in particular, because it&#8217;s the framework KDE uses. Hilsheimer
  notes that KDE&#8217;s role in the Qt community is actually quite important, because
  not only is it a source of people learning how to use Qt and who can thus make contributions
  to the project, KDE also tends to use the latest Qt versions, creating a lot of
  confidence among the wider Qt community to also adopt the latest versions. The relationship
  with KDE and Qt is an interesting one, and sometimes leads to questions about the
  future availability of the open source edition of Qt since the Qt Company licenses
  Qt under a dual-license structure (both open and proprietary). To avoid any uncertainty,
  KDE and Qt have an agreement that covers pretty much every possible scenario and
  which is worded to ensure the availability of Qt as an open source framework. KDE,
  through the KDE Free Qt Foundation, has a number rights and options to ensure the
  availability of Qt as an open source framework. I&#8217;m no lawyer, so I might
  get some of the details wrong, but the main points are that if the Qt Company ever
  decides to discontinue the open source edition of Qt, the KDE Free Qt Foundation
  has the right to release Qt under a BSD-style license within 12 months. The same
  applies to any addition to Qt which are not released as open source; they must be
  released under an open source license within 12 months of initial release. This
  agreement remains valid in the case of buyouts, mergers, or bankruptcies. This agreement
  has existed in one form or another since the late &#8217;90s, and has survived Qt
  being owned by Nokia and Digia, as well as various other organisational changes.
  Despite the issue of Qt&#8217;s ownership coming up every now and then, the agreement
  is pretty airtight, and considering its longevity there&#8217;s no reason to be
  worried about it at all. Still, this structure is clearly more complex and less
  straightforward than, say, the status of GTK and its relationship to GNOME, so it&#8217;s
  not entirely unreasonable the issue comes up every now and then. I wonder if we&#8217;ll
  ever see this situation become less complex, without the need for special agreements.
  While it wouldn&#8217;t make a practical difference, it would make things less&#8230;
  Legalese.
