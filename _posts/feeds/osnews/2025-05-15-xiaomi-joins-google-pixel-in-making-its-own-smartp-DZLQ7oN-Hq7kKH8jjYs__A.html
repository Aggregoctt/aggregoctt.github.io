excerpt: Following rumors, Xiaomi today announced that it will launch its very own
  chip for smartphones later this month. The “XRING 01” is a chip that the company
  has apparently been working on for over 10 years now. Details about the chip are
  scarce so far, but GizmoChina points to recent leaks that suggest the chip is built
  on a 4nm process through TSMC. The chip supposedly has a 1+3+4 layout and should
  lag just a bit behind Snapdragon 8 Elite and Dimensity 9400 in terms of raw horsepower,
  sounding familiar to Google’s work with Tensor chips. ↫ Ben Schoon at 9To5Google
  I like this. Having almost every Android device use Qualcomm&#8217;s chips is not
  good for fostering competition, and weakens Android OEMs&#8217; bargaining position.
  If we have more successful SoC makers, consumers will not only gain access to a
  wider variety of chips that may better suit their needs, it will also force Qualcomm
  to lower its prices, compete better, or both. Everybody wins. Well, except Qualcomm,
  I guess.
