excerpt: About a year ago, we talked about the fact that Android 15 became page size-agnostic,
  supporting both 4 KB and 16 KB page sizes. Google was already pushing developers
  to get their applications ready for 16 KB page sizes, which means recompiling for
  16 KB alignment and testing on a 16 KB version of an Android device or simulator.
  Google is taking the next step now, requiring that every application targeting Android
  15 or higher submitted to Google Play after 1 November 2025 must support a page
  size of 16 KB. This is a key technical requirement to ensure your users can benefit
  from the performance enhancements on newer devices and prepares your apps for the
  platform&#8217;s future direction of improved performance on newer hardware. Without
  recompiling to support 16 KB pages, your app might not function correctly on these
  devices when they become more widely available in future Android releases. â†« Dan
  Brown on the Android Developers Blog This is mostly only relevant for developers
  instead of users, but in the extremely unlikely scenario that one of your favourite
  applications cannot be made to work with 16 KB page sizes for some weird reason,
  or the developer refuses to support it or some even weirder reason, you might have
  to say goodbye to that applications if you use Android 15 or higher. This is absurdly
  unlikely, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it happens to at least one application.
  If that happens, I want to know which application that is, and ask the developer
  for their story.
