excerpt: You want more &#8220;AI&#8221;? No? Well, too damn bad, here&#8217;s &#8220;AI&#8221;
  in your file manager. With AI actions in File Explorer, you can interact more deeply
  with your files by right-clicking to quickly take actions like editing images or
  summarizing documents. Like with Click to Do, AI actions in File Explorer allow
  you to stay in your flow while leveraging the power of AI to take advantage of editing
  tools in apps or Copilot functionality without having to open your file. AI actions
  in File Explorer are easily accessible – to try out AI actions in File Explorer,
  just right-click on a file and you will see a new AI actions entry on the content
  menu that allows you to choose from available options for your file. ↫ Amanda Langowski
  and Brandon LeBlanc at the Windows Blogs What, you don&#8217;t like it? There, &#8220;AI&#8221;
  that reads all your email and sifts through your Google Drive to barf up stunt,
  soulless replies. Gmail’s smart replies, which suggest potential replies to your
  emails, will be able to pull information from your Gmail inbox and from your Google
  Drive and better match your tone and style, all with help from Gemini, the company
  announced at I/O. ↫ Jay Peters at The Verge Ready to submit? No? Your browser now
  has &#8220;AI&#8221; integrated and will do your browsing for usyou. Starting tomorrow,
  Gemini in Chrome will begin rolling out on desktop to Google AI Pro and Google AI
  Ultra subscribers in the U.S. who use English as their Chrome language on Windows
  and macOS. This first version allows you to easily ask Gemini to clarify complex
  information on any webpage you&#8217;re reading or summarize information. In the
  future, Gemini will be able to work across multiple tabs and navigate websites on
  your behalf. ↫ Josh Woodward Mercy? You want mercy? You sure give up easily, but
  we&#8217;re not done yet. We destroyed internet search and now we&#8217;re replacing
  it with &#8220;AI&#8221;, and you will like it. Announced today at Google I/O, AI
  Mode is now available to all US users. The focused version of Google Search distills
  results into AI-generated summaries with links to certain topics. Unlike AI Overviews,
  which appear above traditional search results, AI Mode is a dedicated interface
  where you interact almost exclusively with AI. ↫ Ben Schoon at 9To5Google We&#8217;re
  going to assume control of your phone, too. The technology powering Gemini Live’s
  camera and screen sharing is called Project Astra. It’s available as an Android
  app for trusted testers, and Google today unveiled agentic capabilities for Project
  Astra, including how it can control your Android phone. ↫ Abner Li at 9To5Google
  And just to make sure our &#8220;AI&#8221; can control your phone, we&#8217;ll let
  it instruct developers how to make applications, too. That&#8217;s precisely the
  problem Stitch aims to solve – Stitch is a new experiment from Google Labs that
  allows you to turn simple prompt and image inputs into complex UI designs and frontend
  code in minutes. ↫ Vincent Nallatamby, Arnaud Benard, and Sam El-Husseini You are
  not needed. You will be replaced. Submit.
