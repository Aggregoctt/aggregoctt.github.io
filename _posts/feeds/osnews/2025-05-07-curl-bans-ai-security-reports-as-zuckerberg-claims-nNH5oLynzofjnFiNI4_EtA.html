excerpt: 'Daniel Stenberg, creator and maintainer of curl, has had enough of the neverending
  torrent of &#8220;AI&#8221;-generated security reports the curl project has to deal
  with. That&#8217;s it. I&#8217;ve had it. I&#8217;m putting my foot down on this
  craziness. 1. Every reporter submitting security reports on Hackerone for curl now
  needs to answer this question: &#8220;Did you use an AI to find the problem or generate
  this submission?&#8221; (and if they do select it, they can expect a stream of proof
  of actual intelligence follow-up questions) 2. We now ban every reporter INSTANTLY
  who submits reports we deem AI slop. A threshold has been reached. We are effectively
  being DDoSed. If we could, we would charge them for this waste of our time. We still
  have not seen a single valid security report done with AI help. ↫ Daniel Stenberg
  This is the real impact of &#8220;AI&#8221;: streams of digital trash real humans
  have to clean up. While proponents of &#8220;AI&#8221; keep claiming it will increase
  productivity, actual studies show this not to be the case. Instead, what &#8220;AI&#8221;
  is really doing is create more work for others to deal with by barfing useless garbage
  into other people&#8217;s backyards. It&#8217;s like the digital version of the
  western world sending its trash to third-world countries to deal with. The best
  possible sign that &#8220;AI&#8221; is a toxic trash heap you wouldn&#8217;t want
  to have anything to do with are the people fighting for team &#8220;AI&#8221;. In
  Zuckerberg’s vision for a new digital future, artificial-intelligence friends outnumber
  human companions and chatbot experiences supplant therapists, ad agencies and coders.
  AI will play a central role in the human experience, the Facebook co-founder and
  CEO of Meta Platforms has said in a series of recent podcasts, interviews and public
  appearances. ↫ Meghan Bobrowsky at the WSJ Mark Zuckerberg, who built his empire
  by using people&#8217;s photos without permission so he could rank who was hotter,
  who used Facebook logins to break into journalists&#8217; email accounts because
  they were about to publish a negative story about him, who called Facebook users
  &#8220;dumb fucks&#8221; for entrusting their personal information to him, is on
  the forefront fighting for &#8220;AI&#8221;. If that isn&#8217;t the ultimate proof
  there&#8217;s something deeply wrong and ethically unsound about &#8220;AI&#8221;,
  I don&#8217;t know what is.'
