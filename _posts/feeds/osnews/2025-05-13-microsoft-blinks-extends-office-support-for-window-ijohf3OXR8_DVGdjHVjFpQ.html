excerpt: 'At the start of this year, Microsoft announced that, alongside the end of
  support for Windows 10, it would also end support for Office 365 (it&#8217;s called
  Microsoft 365 now but that makes no sense to me) on Windows 10 around the same time.
  The various Office applications would continue to work on Windows 10, of course,
  but would no longer receive bug fixes, security plugs, and so on. Well, it seems
  Microsoft experienced some pushback on this one, because it just extended this end-of-support
  deadline for Office 365 on Windows 10 by an additional three years. To help maintain
  security while you transition to Windows 11, Microsoft will continue providing security
  updates for Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows 10 for three years after Windows 10 reaches
  end of support. These updates will be delivered through the standard update channels,
  ending on October 10, 2028. â†« Microsoft support article The reality is that the
  vast majority of Windows users are still using Windows 10, and despite countless
  shady shenanigans and promises of &#8220;AI&#8221; bliss, there&#8217;s relatively
  little movement in the breakdown between Windows 10 and Windows 11 users. As such,
  the idea that Microsoft would just stop fixing security issues and bugs in Office
  on Windows 10 a few months from now seemed preposterous from the outset, and that
  seems to have penetrated the walls of Microsoft&#8217;s executives, too. The real
  question now is: will Microsoft extend the same courtesy to Windows 10 itself? The
  clock is ticking, there&#8217;s only a few months left to go before support for
  Windows 10 ends, leaving 60-70% of Windows users without security fixes and updates.
  If they blinked with Office, why wouldn&#8217;t they blink with Windows 10, too?
  Who dares to place a bet?'
