excerpt: 'We are today officially deprecating two installation methods and three legacy
  CPU architectures. We always strive to have Home Assistant run on almost anything,
  but sometimes we must make difficult decisions to keep the project moving forward.
  Though these changes will only affect a small percentage of Home Assistant users,
  we want to do everything in our power to make this easy for those who may need to
  migrate. â†« Franck Nijhof on the Home Assistant blog Home Assistant is quite popular
  among the kind of people who read OSNews, and this news might actually hit our little
  demographic particularly hard. The legacy CPU architectures they&#8217;re removing
  support for won&#8217;t make much of a difference, as we&#8217;re talking 32bit
  x86 and 32bit ARM, although that last one does include version 1 and 2 of the Raspberry
  Pi, which were quite popular at the time. Do check to make sure you&#8217;re not
  running your Home Assistant installation on one of those. The bigger hit is the
  deprecation of two installation methods: Home Assistant Core and Home Assistant&#8217;s
  Supervised installation method. In Core, you&#8217;re running it in a Python environment,
  and with Supervised, you&#8217;re installing the various components that make up
  Home Assistant manually. Supervised is used to install Home Assistant on unsupported
  operating systems, like the various flavours of BSD. What this means is that if
  you are running Home Assistant on, say, OpenBSD, you&#8217;re going to have to migrate
  soon. Apparently, these installation methods are not used very often, and are difficult
  for Home Assistant to support. These changes do not mean you can no longer perform
  these installation methods; it just means they are not supported, will be removed
  from the documentation, and new issues with these methods will not be accepted.
  Of course, anyone is free to take over hosting any documentation and guides, as
  Home Assistant is open source. Home Assistant generally wants you to use Home Assistant
  OS, which is basically a Linux distribution designed to run Home Assistant, either
  on real hardware (which is what I do, on an x86 thin client) or in a container.'
