excerpt: VectorVFS is a lightweight Python package that transforms your Linux filesystem
  into a vector database by leveraging the native VFS (Virtual File System) extended
  attributes. Rather than maintaining a separate index or external database, VectorVFS
  stores vector embeddings directly alongside each file—turning your existing directory
  structure into an efficient and semantically searchable embedding store. VectorVFS
  supports Meta’s Perception Encoders (PE)  which includes image/video encoders for
  vision language understanding, it outperforms InternVL3, Qwen2.5VL and SigLIP2 for
  zero-shot image tasks. We support both CPU and GPU but if you have a large collection
  of images it might take a while in the first time to embed all items if you are
  not using a GPU. ↫ Christian S. Perone It won&#8217;t surprise many of you that
  this goes a bit above my paygrade, but according to my limited understanding, VectorVFS
  stores information about files inside the xattr part of inodes. The information
  being stored is converted into vectors first, and this is the part that breaks my
  brain a bit, because vectors in this context are far too complex for me to understand.
  I vaguely understand the end result here &#8211; making files searchable using vector
  magic without using a dedicated database or separate files by using extended attributes
  in inodes &#8211; but the process is far more complicated to understand. It still
  seems like a very interesting approach, though, and I&#8217;d love for people smarter
  than me to take VectorVFS apart and explain it in easier terms for those of us who
  don&#8217;t fully grasp it.
