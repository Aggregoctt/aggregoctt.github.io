excerpt: I don&#8217;t know anything about hiring processes in Silicon Valley, or
  about hiring processes in general since I&#8217;ve always worked for myself (and
  still do, running OSNews, relying on your generous Patreon and Ko-Fi support), so
  when I ran into this horror story of applying for a position at a Silicon Valley
  startup, I was horrified. Apparently it&#8217;s not unheard of &#8211; it might
  even be common? &#8211; to ask applicants for a coding position to develop a complex
  application, for free, without much guidance beyond some vague, generic instructions?
  In this case, the applicant, Jose Vargas, was applying for a position at Kagi, the
  search startup with the, shall we say, somewhat evangelical fanbase. After applying,
  he was asked to develop a complete e-mail client, either as a TUI/CLI or a web application
  that can view and send emails, using a fake or a real backend, which can display
  at least plaintext e-mails. None of this was going to be paid labour, of course.
  Vargas started out by sending in a detailed proposal of what he was planning to
  create, ending with the obvious question what kind of response he&#8217;d get if
  he actually implemented the detailed proposal. He got a generic response in return,
  without an answer to that question, but he set out to work regardless. In the end,
  it took him about a week to complete the project and send it in. He eventually received
  a canned rejection notice in response, and after asking for clarification the hiring
  manager told him they wanted something &#8220;simpler and stronger&#8221;, so he
  didn&#8217;t make the cut. I&#8217;m not interested in debating whether or not Vargas
  was suited for the position, or if the unpaid work he sent in was any good. What
  I do want to talk about, though, is the insane amount of unpaid labour applicants
  are apparently asked to do in Silicon Valley, the utter lack of clear and detailed
  instructions, and how the hiring manager didn&#8217;t answer the question Vargas
  sent in alongside his detailed proposal. After all, the hiring manager could&#8217;ve
  saved everyone a ton of time by letting Vargas know upfront the proposal wasn&#8217;t
  what Kagi was looking for. Everything about this feels completely asinine to me.
  As a (former) translator, I&#8217;m no stranger to having to do some work to give
  a potential client an idea of what my work looks like, but more than half a page
  of text to translate was incredibly rare. Only on a few rare occasions did a prospective
  client want me to translate more than that, and in those cases it was always as
  paid labour, at the normal, regular rate. For context, half a page of text is less
  than half an hour of work &#8211; a far cry from a week&#8217;s worth of unpaid
  labour. I&#8217;ve read a ton of online discourse about this particular story, and
  there&#8217;s no clear consensus on whether or not Vargas&#8217; feelings are justified.
  Personally, I find the instructions given by Kagi overly broad and vague, the task
  of creating an email client to be overly demanding, and the canned (&#8220;AI&#8221;?)
  responses by the hiring manager insulting &#8211; after sending in such a detailed
  proposal, it should&#8217;ve been easy for a halfway decent hiring manager to realise
  Vargas might not be a good fit for the role, and tell him so before he started doing
  any work. Kagi is fully within its right to determine who is and is not a good fit
  for the company, and who they hire is entirely up to them. If such stringent, demanding
  hiring practices are par for the course in Silicon Valley, I also can&#8217;t really
  fault them for toeing the industry line. The hiring manager&#8217;s behaviour seems
  problematic, but everyone makes mistakes and nobody&#8217;s perfect. In short, I&#8217;m
  not even really mad at Kagi specifically here. However, if such hiring practices
  are indeed the norm, can I, as an outsider, just state the obvious? What on earth
  are you people doing to each other over there in Silicon Valley? Is this really
  how you want to treat potential applicants, and how you, yourself, want to be treated?
  Imagine if a someone applies to be a retail clerk at a local supermarket, and the
  supermarket&#8217;s hiring manager asks the applicant to work an entire week in
  the store, stocking shelves and helping shoppers, without paying the person any
  wages, only to deny their application after the week of free labour is over? You
  all realise how insane that sounds, right? Why not look at a person&#8217;s previous
  work, hosted on GitHub or any of its alternatives? Why not contact their previous
  employers and ask about their performance there, as happens in so many other industries?
  Why, instead of asking someone to craft an entire email client, don&#8217;t you
  just give them a few interesting bugs to look at that won&#8217;t take an entire
  week of work? Why not, you know, pay for their labour if you demand a week&#8217;s
  worth of work? I&#8217;m so utterly baffled by all of this. Y&#8217;all developers
  need a union.
