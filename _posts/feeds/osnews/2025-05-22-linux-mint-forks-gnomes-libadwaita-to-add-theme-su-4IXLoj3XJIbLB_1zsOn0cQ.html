excerpt: 'On numerous occasions, we&#8217;ve talked about the issue facing non-GNOME
  GTK desktops, like Xfce, MATE, and Cinnamon: the popularity of Libadwaita. With
  more and more application developers opting for GNOME&#8217;s Libadwaita because
  of the desktop environment&#8217;s popularity, many popular GTK applications now
  look like GNOME applications instead of GTK applications, and they just don&#8217;t
  mesh well with traditional GTK desktops. Since Libadwaita is not themeable, applications
  that use it can&#8217;t really be made to feel at home on non-GNOME GTK desktops,
  unless said desktops adopt the entire GNOME design language, handing over control
  ovr their GUI design to outsiders in the process. The developers of Libadwaita,
  as well as the people behind GNOME, have made it very clear they do not intend to
  make Libadwaita themeable, and they are well within their rights to make that decision.
  I think it&#8217;s a bad decision &#8211; themeing is a crucial accessibility feature
  &#8211; but it&#8217;s their project, their code, and their time, and I fully respect
  their decision, since it&#8217;s really not up to GNOME to worry about the other
  GTK desktops. So, what are the developers of Xfce, MATE, and Cinnamon supposed to
  do? Well, how about taking matters into their own hands? Clement Lefebvre, the lead
  developer of Linux Mint and its Cinnamon desktop environment, has soft-forked Libadwaita
  to add theme support to the library. They&#8217;re calling it LibAdapta. libAdapta
  is libAdwaita with theme support and a few extra. It provides the same features
  and the same look as libAdwaita by default. In desktop environments which provide
  theme selection, libAdapta apps follow the theme and use the proper window controls.
  ↫ LibAdapta&#8217;s GitHub page The reason they consider libAdapta a &#8220;soft-fork&#8221;
  is that all it does is add theme support; they do not intended to deviate from Libadwaita
  in any other way, and will follow Libadwaita&#8217;s releases. It will use the current
  GTK3 theme, and will fallback to the default Libadwaita look and feel if the GTK3
  theme in question doesn&#8217;t have a libadapta-1.0 directory. This seems like
  a transparent and smart way to handle it. I doubt it will be long before libAdapta
  becomes a default part of a lot of user instructions online, GTK theme developers
  will probably add support for it pretty quickly, and perhaps even of a lot of non-GNOME
  GTK desktop environments will add it by default. It will make it a lot easier for,
  say, the developers of MATE to make use of the latest Libadwaita applications, without
  having to either accept a disjointed, inconsistent user experience, or adopt the
  GNOME design language hook, line, and sinker and lose all control over the user
  experience they wish to offer to their users. I&#8217;m glad this exists now, and
  hope it will prove to be popular. I appreciate the pragmatic approach taken here
  &#8211; a relatively simple fork that doesn&#8217;t burden upstream, without long
  feature request threads where everybody is shouting at each other that needlessly
  spill over onto Fedi. This is how open source is supposed to work.'
