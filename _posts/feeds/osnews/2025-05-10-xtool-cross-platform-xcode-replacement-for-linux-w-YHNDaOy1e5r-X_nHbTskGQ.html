excerpt: A few months ago I shared my Swift SDK for Darwin, which allows you to build
  iOS Swift Packages on Linux, amongst other things. I mentioned that a lot of work
  still needed to be done, such as handling codesigning, packaging, and bundling.
  I&#8217;m super excited to share that we&#8217;ve finally reached the point where
  all of these things are now possible with cross-platform, open source software.
  Enter, xtool!  This means it&#8217;s finally possible to build and deploy iOS apps
  from Linux and Windows (WSL). At the same time, xtool is SwiftPM-based and fully
  declarative, which means you can also use it to replace Xcode on macOS for building
  iOS software! â†« kabiroberai While this is obviously an impressive piece of engineering
  that&#8217;s taken countless years to fully put together, the issue this doesn&#8217;t
  address are Apple&#8217;s licensing terms when it comes to Xcode and development
  for Apple&#8217;s platforms. The Apple Developer Program License Agreement clearly
  forbids installing Xcode and the Apple SDK on non-Apple branded devices, and as
  this new xtool requires you download Xcode.xip and use it, it seems it violates
  these terms. Now, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, these terms are idiotic and should
  be 100% illegal, but if you&#8217;re an Apple developer who relies on your Apple
  developer account to make money, using a tool like this definitely has the potential
  to put your developer account at risk. For experimentation, sure, this is great,
  but for any official work I would be quite weary until Apple makes some sort of
  statement about the matter, which is highly unlikely to happen. Perhaps the courts
  can, at some point, have a say here &#8211; especially in the EU &#8211; but even
  then, Apple can always find or manufacture some reason to terminate your account
  if they really want to. If you want to develop on your own terms, perhaps developing
  for Apple platforms is not what you should be doing.
