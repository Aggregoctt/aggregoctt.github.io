excerpt: 'You may not have heard of the &#8220;Transparency &#38; Consent Framework&#8221;,
  but you&#8217;ve most likely interacted with it, probably on a daily basis. The
  TCF is used by 80% of the internet to obtain &#8220;consent&#8221; from users to
  collect their data and share it among advertisers &#8211; you know, the cookie popups.
  In a landmark EU ruling yesterday, the TCF has been declared to violate the GDPR,
  making it illegal. For seven years, the tracking industry has used the TCF as a
  legal cover for Real-Time Bidding (RTB), the vast advertising auction system that
  operates behind the scenes on websites and apps. RTB tracks what Internet users
  look at and where they go in the real world. It then continuously broadcasts this
  data to a host of companies, enabling them to keep dossiers on every Internet user.
  Because there is no security in the RTB system it is impossible to know what then
  happens to the data. As a result, it is also impossible to provide the necessary
  information that must accompany a consent request. ↫ Irish Council for Civil Liberties
  It&#8217;s no secret that cookie consent popups do not actually comply with the
  GDPR, and that they are not even necessary if you simply don&#8217;t do any cross-site
  sharing of personal information. It seems that this ruling confirms this in a legal
  sense, forcing the advertising industry to come up with a new, better system. On
  top of that, every individual company that participated in this scheme is now liable
  for fines and damages. Complaints coordinated by Johnny Ryan, Director of Enforce
  at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, prompted the ruling. He said: Today&#8217;s
  court&#8217;s decision shows that the consent system used by Google, Amazon, X,
  Microsoft, deceives hundreds of millions of Europeans. The tech industry has sought
  to hide its vast data breach behind sham consent popups. Tech companies turned the
  GDPR into a daily nuisance rather than a shield for people. ↫ Irish Council for
  Civil Liberties The problem here is not so much the clarity of applicable laws and
  regulations, but the cost and effectiveness of enforcement. If it takes years of
  expensive and complex legal proceedings to bring a company that violates the GDPR
  to heel, is it really an effective legal framework? Especially when you take into
  account just how many companies, big and small, there are that violate the GDPR?
  OSNews uses a cookie popup and displays advertising, something we have to do to
  gain a little bit of extra income &#8211; but I&#8217;m not happy about it. Our
  ads don&#8217;t provide us with much income, perhaps about €150-200, but that&#8217;s
  still a decent enough chunk of our income pie that we need it. I would greatly prefer
  we turn off these ads altogether, but in order to be able to afford that, we&#8217;d
  need to up our Patreon income. OSNews Patreons get an ad-free version of OSNews.
  That&#8217;s a long and slow process, especially with the current economic uncertainty
  making people reconsider their expenses. Disabling our ads altogether for everyone
  once we&#8217;re fully reader-funded is still my end goal, but until the world around
  us settles down a bit, that&#8217;s a little while off. If you want to speed this
  process up &#8211; you can become an OSNews Patreon and enjoy an ad-free OSNews
  today.'
