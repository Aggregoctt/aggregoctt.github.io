excerpt: 'The openSUSE team has decided to remove the Deepin Desktop Environment from
  openSUSE, after the project&#8217;s packager for openSUSE was found to have added
  workaround specifically to bypass various security requirements openSUSE has in
  place for RPM packages. Recently we noticed a policy violation in the packaging
  of the Deepin desktop environment in openSUSE. To get around security review requirements,
  our Deepin community packager implemented a workaround which bypasses the regular
  RPM packaging mechanisms to install restricted assets. As a result of this violation,
  and in the light of the difficult history we have with Deepin code reviews, we will
  be removing the Deepin Desktop packages from openSUSE distributions for the time
  being. â†« Matthias Gerstner Matthias Gerstner goes into great detail to lay out every
  single time the openSUSE team found massive, glaring security issues in Deepin,
  and the complete lack of adequate responses from the Deepin upstream team over the
  past 8 or so years. It&#8217;s absolutely shocking to see how utterly lax the Deepin
  developers have been regarding the security of their desktop environment and its
  dependencies, and the openSUSE team could really only come to one harsh conclusion:
  Deepin has no security culture whatsoever, and it&#8217;s extremely likely that
  every corner of the Deepin code is riddled with very serious security issues. As
  such, despite the relatively large number of Deepin users on openSUSE, the team
  has decided to remove Deepin from openSUSE entirely, instead pointing users to a
  third-party repository if they desire to keep using Deepin. I think this is the
  best possible option in this situation, but it&#8217;s not exactly ideal. After
  reading this entire saga, however, I don&#8217;t think anyone who cares about security
  should be using Deepin. Of course, I doubt this will be the end of the story. What
  about all the other Linux distributions out there? The security issues in Deepin
  itself are most likely also present in Debian, Fedora, and other distributions who
  have the Deepin Desktop Environment in their repositories, but what about the workaround
  to bypass packaging security practices? Does that exist elsewhere as well? I think
  we&#8217;re about to find out.'
