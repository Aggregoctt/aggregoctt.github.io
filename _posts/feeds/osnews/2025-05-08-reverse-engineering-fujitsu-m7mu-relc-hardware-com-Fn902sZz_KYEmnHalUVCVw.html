excerpt: This is a follow-up to the Samsung NX mini (M7MU) firmware reverse-engineering
  series. This part is about the proprietary LZSS compression used for the code sections
  in the firmware of Samsung NX mini, NX3000/NX3300 and Galaxy K Zoom. The post is
  documenting the step-by-step discovery process, in order to show how an unknown
  compression algorithm can be analyzed. The discovery process was supported by Igor
  Skochinsky and Tedd Sterr, and by writing the ideas out on encode.su. â†« Georg Lukas
  It&#8217;s not weekend quite yet, but here&#8217;s some light reading ahead of time.
