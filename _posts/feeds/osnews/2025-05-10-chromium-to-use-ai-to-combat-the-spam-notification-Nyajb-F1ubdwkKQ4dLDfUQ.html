excerpt: Notifications in Chrome are a useful feature to keep up with updates from
  your favorite sites. However, we know that some notifications may be spammy or even
  deceptive. We’ve received reports of notifications diverting you to download suspicious
  software, tricking you into sharing personal information or asking you to make purchases
  on potentially fraudulent online store fronts. To defend against these threats,
  Chrome is launching warnings of unwanted notifications on Android. This new feature
  uses on-device machine learning to detect and warn you about potentially deceptive
  or spammy notifications, giving you an extra level of control over the information
  displayed on your device. ↫ Hannah Buonomo and Sarah Krakowiak Criel on the Chromium
  Blog So first web browser makers introduce notifications, a feature nobody asked
  for and everybody hates, and now they&#8217;re using &#8220;AI&#8221; to combat
  the spam they themselves enabled and forced onto everyone? Don&#8217;t we have a
  name for a business model where you purport to protect your clients from threats
  you yourself pose? Turning off notifications is one of the first things I do after
  installing a browser. I do not ever want any website sending me a notification,
  nor do I want any of them to ask me for permission to do so. They&#8217;re such
  an obvious annoyance and massive security threat, and it&#8217;s absolutely mindboggling
  to me we just accept them as a feature we have to live with. I genuinely wish browsers
  like Firefox, which claim to protect your privacy, would just have the guts to be
  opinionated and rip shit features like this straight out of their browser. Using
  &#8220;AI&#8221; to combat spam notifications instead of just turning notifications
  off is peak techbro.
