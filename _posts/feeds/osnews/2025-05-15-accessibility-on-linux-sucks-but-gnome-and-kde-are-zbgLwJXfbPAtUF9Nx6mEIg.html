excerpt: Accessibility in the software world is a problem in general, but it&#8217;s
  an even bigger problem on open source desktops, as painfully highlighted by this
  excellent article detailing the utterly broken state of accessibility on Linux.
  Reading the article is soul-crushing as it starts to dawn on you just how bad the
  situation really is for those among us who require accessibility features, making
  it virtually impossible for them to switch to Linux. This obviously has to change,
  and it just so happens that both on the GTK/GNOME and KDE side, recent work on accessibility
  has delivered some valuable results. Starting with GTK and GNOME, the framework
  has recently merged the AccessKit backend with GTK 4.18, which enables accessibility
  features when running GTK applications on Windows and macOS. On Linux, GTK still
  defaults to at-spi, but I&#8217;m sure this will change eventually too. Another
  major improvement are the special keyboard shortcuts normally provided by the screen
  reader Orca. Support for these was in the works for a while but incomplete, but
  now this work has been completed, and the new shortcuts ship as part of GNOME 48.
  Accessibility support for GNOME Web has been greatly improved as well, and Elevado
  is a new tool that shows you what applications expose on the a11y bus. There&#8217;s
  a ton additional, smaller changes too. On the KDE side, a number of accessibility
  improvements have been implemented as part of the project&#8217;s goal to improving
  input handling. You can now use the numerical pad&#8217;s arrow keys to move the
  mouse cursor, there&#8217;s a new 3-finger gesture to invoke the desktop zoom accessibility
  feature, keyboard navigation in general has been improved in a wide variety of places
  in KDE, and a whole bunch more improvements. In addition, a number of financial
  grants have been given to developers working on accessibility in KDE, such as a
  project to make file management-related features &#8211; think open/save dialogs,
  Dolphin, and so on &#8211; fully accessibly, and projects to make touchpad and screen
  gestures fully customisable. Accessibility is never really &#8220;done&#8221; or
  &#8220;perfect&#8221;, but there&#8217;s definitely an increasing awareness among
  the two major open source desktops of just how important it is. A few confounding
  factors &#8211; like the switch to Wayland or the complicated history of audio on
  Linux &#8211; have actually hurt accessibility, and it&#8217;s only now that things
  are starting to look up again. However, as anyone with reduced vision or auditory
  problems can tell you, Linux and the open source desktop still has a very long way
  to go.
