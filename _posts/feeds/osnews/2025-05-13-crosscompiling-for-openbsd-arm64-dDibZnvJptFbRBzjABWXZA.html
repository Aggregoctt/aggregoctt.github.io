excerpt: Following on from OpenBSD/arm64 on QEMU, it’s not always practical to compile
  userland software or a new kernel on some systems, particularly small SoCs with
  limited space and memory &#8211; or indeed QEMU, in fear of melting your CPU. There
  are two scenarios here &#8211; the first, if you are looking for a standard cross-compiler
  for Aarch64, and the second if you want an OpenBSD-specific environment. ↫ Daniel
  Nechtan Exactly what it says on the tin.
