excerpt: 'How do you get email to the folks without computers? What if the Post Office
  printed out email, stamped it, dropped it in folks’ mailboxes along with the rest
  of their mail, and saved the USPS once and for all? And so in 1982 E-COM was born—and,
  inadvertently, helped coin the term “e-mail.” ↫ Justin Duke The implementation of
  E-COM was awesome. You&#8217;d enter the messages on your computer, send it to the
  post office using a TTY or IBM 2780/3789 terminals, to Sperry Rand Univac 1108 computer
  systems at one of 25 post offices. Postal staff would print the messages and send
  them through the regular postal system to their recipients. The USPS actually tried
  to get a legal monopoly on this concept, but the FCC fought them in court and won
  out. E-COM wasn&#8217;t the breakout success the USPS had hoped for, but it did
  catch on in one, unpleasant way: spam. The official-looking E-COM enevelopes from
  the USPS were very attractive to junk mail companies, and it was estimated that
  about six companies made up 70% of the total E-COM volume of 15 million messages
  in its second year of operation. The entire article is definitely recommended reading,
  as it contains a ton more information about E-COM and some of the other attempts
  by USPS to ride the coattails of the computer and internet revolution, including
  the idea to give every US resident an @.us e-mail address. Wild.'
