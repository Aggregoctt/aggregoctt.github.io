excerpt: I&#8217;ve &#8220;launched&#8221; the Mac Themes Garden! It is a website
  showcasing more than 3,000 (and counting) Kaleidoscope from the Classic Mac era,
  ready to be seen, downloaded and explored! Check it out! Oh, and there also is an
  RSS feed you can subscribe to see themes as they are added/updated! â†« Damien Erambert
  If you&#8217;ve spent any time on retrocomputing-related social media channels,
  you&#8217;ve definitely seen the old classic Mac OS themes in your timeline. They
  are exquisitely beautiful artifacts of a bygone era, and the work Damien Erambert
  has been doing to make these easily available and shareable, entirely in his free
  time, is awesome and a massive service to the retrocomputing community. The process
  to get these themes loaded up onto the website is actually a lot more involved than
  you might imagine. It involves a classic Mac OS virtual machine, applying themes,
  taking screenshots, collecting creator information, and adding everything to a database.
  This process is mostly manual, and Erambart estimates he&#8217;s about halfway done.
  If you have classic Mac OS running somewhere, on real hardware or in a virtual machine,
  you can now easily theme it at your heart&#8217;s content.
