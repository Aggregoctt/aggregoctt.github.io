excerpt: I think one of the more controversial parts of Windows 11 &#8211; aside from
  its system requirements, privacy issues, crapware, and &#8220;AI&#8221; nonsense
  &#8211; is its Start menu. I&#8217;ve heard so many complaints about how it&#8217;s
  organised, its performance, the lack of customisation, and so on. Microsoft heard
  those complaints, and has unveiled the new Start menu that&#8217;ll be shipping
  to Windows 11 soon &#8211; and I have to say, there&#8217;s a ton of genuine improvements
  here that I think many of you will be happy with. First and foremost, the &#8220;all
  applications&#8221; view, that until now has been hidden behind a button, will be
  at the top level, and you can choose between a category view, a grid view, and a
  list view. This alone makes the Windows 11 Start menu so much more usable, and will
  be more than enough to make a lot of users want to upgrade, I&#8217;m sure. Second,
  customisation is taken a lot more seriously in this new incarnation of the Start
  menu. You can actually shrink or remove completely sections you&#8217;re not using.
  If you&#8217;re not interested in those recommendations, you can just remove that
  section. Don&#8217;t want to use the feature where you pin applications to the Start
  menu? Remove that section. This, too, seems to address common complaints, and I&#8217;m
  glad Microsoft is fixing this. Then there&#8217;s the rest. Microsoft is promising
  this new Start menu will perform better, which better be true because I&#8217;ve
  seen some serious lag and delays on incredibly powerful hardware. The recommendations
  have been improved as well, in case you care about those, and there&#8217;s a new
  optional mobile panel that you can slide out, which contains everything related
  to your phone. Personally, I&#8217;m a classic Start menu kind of person &#8211;
  on all my machines (which all run Fedora KDE), I use a classic, very traditional
  cascading menu that contains nothing but application categories and their respective
  applications, and nothing more. Still, were I forced to use Windows, these improvements
  are welcome, and they seem genuine.
