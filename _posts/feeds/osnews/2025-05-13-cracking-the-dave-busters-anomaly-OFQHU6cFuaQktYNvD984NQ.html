excerpt: 'Let&#8217;s dive into a peculiar bug in iOS. And by that I mean, let&#8217;s
  follow along as Guilherme Rambo dives into a peculiar bug in iOS. The bug is that,
  if you try to send an audio message using the Messages app to someone who’s also
  using the Messages app, and that message happens to include the name “Dave and Buster’s”,
  the message will never be received. ↫ Guilherme Rambo As I read this first description
  of the bug, I had no idea what could possibly be causing this. However, once Rambo
  explained that every audio messages is transcribed by Apple into a text version,
  I immediately assumed what was going on: that &#8220;and&#8221; is throwing up problems
  because the actual name of the brand is stylised with an ampersand, isn&#8217;t
  it? It&#8217;s always DNS HTML, isn&#8217;t it? Yes. Yes it is. MessagesBlastDoorService
  uses MBDXMLParserContext (via MBDHTMLToSuperParserContext) to parse XHTML for the
  audio message. Ampersands have special meaning in XML/HTML and must be escaped,
  so the correct way to represent the transcription in HTML would have been "Dave
  &#38;amp;amp; Buster''s". Apple&#8217;s transcription system is not doing that,
  causing the parser to attempt to detect a special code after the ampersand, and
  since there&#8217;s no valid special code nor semicolon terminating what it thinks
  is an HTML entity, it detects an error and stops parsing the content. ↫ Guilherme
  Rambo It must be somewhat of a relief to programmers and developers the world over
  that even a company as large and filled with talented people as Apple can run into
  bugs like this.'
