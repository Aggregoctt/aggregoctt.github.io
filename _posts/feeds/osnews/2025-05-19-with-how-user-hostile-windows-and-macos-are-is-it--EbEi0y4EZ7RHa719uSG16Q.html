excerpt: Every so often people yearn for a lost (1980s or so) era of &#8216;single
  user computers&#8217;, whether these are simple personal computers or high end things
  like Lisp machines and Smalltalk workstations. It&#8217;s my view that the whole
  idea of a 1980s style &#8220;single user computer&#8221; is not what we actually
  want and has some significant flaws in practice. ↫ Chris Siebenmann I think the
  premise of this entire article is flawed, and borders on being a strawman argument.
  I honestly don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s many people out there who genuinely and
  seriously want to use an &#8217;80s home computer for all their computing tasks,
  but this article seems to think that there are. Virtually every single person expressing
  interest in and a desire for classic computers does so from a point of nostalgia,
  as a learning experience, or as a hobby. They&#8217;re definitely not interested
  in using any of those &#8217;80s machine to do their banking or to collaborate with
  their colleagues. Additionally, the problems and issues people have with modern
  computing platforms is not that they are too complex, but that they are no longer
  designed with the user in mind. Windows, macOS, iOS; they&#8217;re all first and
  foremost designed to extract money from you through ads, upsells, nag screens, and
  similar anti-user features, and it&#8217;s those things that people are sick of.
  Coincidentally, they are all things we didn&#8217;t have to deal with back in the
  &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s. In other words, remove the user-hostility from modern
  operating systems, and people wouldn&#8217;t complain about them so much. Which
  seems rather obvious, doesn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s why using a Linux desktop like
  Fedora is such a breath of fresh air. There&#8217;s no upsells for cloud storage
  or streaming services, no restrictions on what I can and cannot install to protect
  some multitrillion euro company&#8217;s revenue streams, no ads and nag screens
  infesting my operating system &#8211; it&#8217;s just an operating system waiting
  for me to tell it what it do, and then it does it. It&#8217;s wild how increasingly
  revolutionary that&#8217;s becoming. Whenever I am forced to interact with Windows
  11 or whatever the current version of macOS is, I feel such a profound and deep
  sadness for what they&#8217;ve become, and it seems only natural to me that this
  sadness is fueling a longing for back when these systems weren&#8217;t so user-hostile.

  computers from the ’80s and ’90s?
