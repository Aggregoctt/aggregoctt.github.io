excerpt: Last time, we looked at the legacy icons in progman.exe. But what about moricons.dll?
  Here’s a table of the icons that were present in the original Windows 3.1 moricons.dll
  file (in file order) and the programs that Windows used the icons for. As with the
  icons in progman.exe, these icons are mapped from executables according to the information
  in the APPS.INF file. ↫ Raymond Chen These icons age like a fine wine. They&#8217;re
  clear, well-designed, easy to read, and make extraordinary good use of the limited
  amount of available pixels. Icons from Mac OS, BeOS, OS/2, and a few others from
  the same era also look timeless, and I wish modern designers learned a thing or
  two from these.
