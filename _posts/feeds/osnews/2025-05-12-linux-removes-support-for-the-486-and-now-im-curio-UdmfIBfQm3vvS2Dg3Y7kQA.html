excerpt: 'I had to dig through our extensive archive &#8211; OSNews was founded in
  2007, after all &#8211; to see if we reported on it at the time, but it turns out
  we didn&#8217;t: in 2006, Intel announced that in 2007, it would cease production
  of a range of old chips, including the 386 and 486. In Product Change Notification
  106013-01, Intel proclaimed these chips dead. Intel Corporation has been manufacturing
  its MCS 51, MCS 251 and MCS 96 Microcontroller Product Lines for over 25 years now,
  and the Intel 186 Processor Families, the Intel 386 Processor Families and the Intel
  486 Processor Families for over 15 years now. Additionally, we have been manufacturing
  the i960 32 Bit RISC Processor Families for over 15 years. However, at this time,
  the forecasted volumes for these product lines are now too low to continue production
  of these products beyond the year 2007. Therefore, Intel will cease manufacturing
  silicon wafers for our 6&#8243; based processes in 2007. Affected products include
  Intel&#8217;s MCS 51, MCS 251, MCS 96, 80X18X, 80X38X, 80X486DXX, the i960 Family
  of Microcomputers, in addition to the 82371SB, 82439TX and the 82439HX Chipsets.
  Intel has no choice but to issue a Product Discontinuance Notice (PDN) effective
  3/30/06. Last time orders will be accepted till 3/30/07 with last time ship dates
  of 9/28/07. ↫ Intel Product Change Notification 106013-01 Considering the 386, 486,
  and i960 families of processors were only used for niche embedded at very low volumes
  at that point in time, it made sense to call it quits. We&#8217;re 18 years down
  the line now, and I don&#8217;t think anyone really mourns the end of production
  for these processors. Windows ended support for these chips well before the 2007
  end of production date, with Windows 2000 being the last Windows version that would
  run on a 486, albeit only barely, since it officially required a Pentium processor.
  Linux, though, continued to support the 486, but that, too, is now coming to an
  end. In a patch submitted to the LKML, Ingo Molnár, support for a variety of &#8220;complicated
  hardware emulation facilities&#8221; for x86-32 will be removed, effectively ending
  support for 486 and very early 586 processors, by increasing the minimum kernel
  support features to include TSC and CX8 (CMPXCHG8B) hardware support. Linus Torvalds
  has expressed interest in removing support for the 486 back in 2022, so this move
  doesn&#8217;t come as a huge surprise. While most tech news outlets leave it at
  that, as I was reading this news, I immediately thought of the Vortex86 line of
  processors and what this would mean for Linux support for those processors. In case
  you&#8217;re unaware, the Vortex86 is a line of x86-32-compatible processors, originating
  at SiS, but now developed and produced by DMP Electronics in Taiwain. The last two
  variants were the Vortex86DX3, a dual-core chip running at 1Ghz, and the Vortex86EX2,
  a chip with two asymmetrical cores that can run two operating systems at once. Their
  platform support documents for Windows and Linux are from 2021, so we can&#8217;t
  rely on those for more information. Digging through some of the documentation from
  ICOP, who sell industrial PCs based on the latest Vortex86DX3, I think support in
  modern kernels is very much hit and miss even before this news. All Vortex86 processors
  are supposedly i586 (with later variants being i686, even), but some of the earlier
  versions were compatible with the 486SX. On top of that, Linux 4.14 seems to be
  the last kernel that supports any of these chips out-of-the-box based on the documentation
  by DMP &#8211; but then, if you go back to ICOP, you&#8217;ll find news items about
  Linux 5.16 adding better support for Vortex86, so I&#8217;m definitely confused.
  My uneducated guess is that the DX3 and EX2 will probably work even after these
  changes to the Linux kernel, but earlier models might have more problems. Even on
  the LKML I can find messages from the kind of people who know their stuff who don&#8217;t
  know all the ins and outs of these Vortex86 processors, and which instructions they
  actually support. It won&#8217;t matter much for people relying on Vortex86 processors
  in industrial and commercial settings, though, since they tend to use custom stacks
  built by the vendor, so they&#8217;re going to be just fine. What&#8217;s more interesting
  is the what I assume is a small enthusiast market using Vortex86 processors who
  might want to run modern Linux kernels on them. I have a feeling these code removals
  might lead to some issues on especially the earlier models, meaning you&#8217;ll
  have to use older kernels. I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by the Vortex86 line
  of processors, and on numerous occasions I&#8217;ve hovered over the buy button
  on some industrial PC using the VortexDX3 (or earlier) processor. Let me know if
  you&#8217;re interested in seeing what this chip can do, and if there&#8217;s enough
  interest, I can see if I can set a Ko-Fi goal to buy one these and mess around with
  Windows Embedded/CE, Linux, and god knows what else these things can be made to
  run.'
