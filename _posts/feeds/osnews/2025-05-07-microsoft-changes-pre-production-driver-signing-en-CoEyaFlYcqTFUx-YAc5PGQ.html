excerpt: As the headline suggests, we&#8217;re going to be talking about some very
  dry Windows stuff that only affects a relatively small number of people, but for
  those people this is a big deal they need to address. If you&#8217;re working on
  pre-production drivers that need to be signed, this is important to you. The Windows
  Hardware Program supports partners signing drivers for use in pre-production environments.
  The CA that is used to sign the binaries for use in pre-production environments
  on the Windows Hardware Program is set to expire in July 2025, following which a
  new CA will be used to sign the preproduction content starting June 9, 2025. â†« Hardware
  Dev Center Alongside the new CA come a bunch of changes to the rules. First and
  foremost, expiry of signed drivers will no longer be tied to the expiry of the underlying
  CA, so any driver signed with the new CA will not expire, regardless of what happens
  to the CA. In addition, on April 22, May 13, and June 10, 2025, Windows servicing
  releases (4D/5B/6B) will be shipped to Windows versions (down to Windows Server
  2008) to replace the old CAs with the new ones. As such, if you&#8217;re working
  on pre-production drivers, you need to install those Latest Cumulative updates.
  On a very much related note, Microsoft has announced it&#8217;s retiring device
  metadata and the Windows Metadata and Internet Services (WMIS). This is what allowed
  OEMs and device makers to include things like device names, custom device icons,
  and other information in the form of an XML file. While OEMs can no longer create
  new device metadata this way, existing metadata already installed on Windows clients
  will remain functional. As a replacement for this functionality, Microsoft points
  to the driver&#8217;s INF files, where such information and icons can also be included.
  Riveting stuff.
