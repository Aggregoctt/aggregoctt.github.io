excerpt: 'The Amiga, a once-dominant force in the personal computer world, continues
  to hold a special place in the hearts of many. But with limited next-gen hardware
  available and dwindling AmigaOS4 support, the future of this beloved platform seemed
  uncertain. That is, until four Dutch passionate individuals, Dave, Harald, Paul,
  and Marco, decided to take matters into their own hands. Driven by a shared love
  for the Amiga and a desire to see it thrive, they embarked on an ambitious project:
  to create a new, low-cost next-gen Amiga mainboard. â†« Mirari&#8217;s Our Story page
  Experience has taught me to be&#8230; Careful of news of new hardware from the Amiga
  world, but for once I have strong reasons to believe this one is actually the real
  deal. The development story &#8211; from the initial KiCad renders to the first
  five, fully functional prototype boards &#8211; seems to be on track, software support
  for Amiga OS is in development, Linux is working great already, and since today,
  MorphOS also boots on the board. It&#8217;s called the Mirari, and it&#8217;s very
  Dutch. So, what are we looking at here? The Mirari is a micro-ATX board, sporting
  either a PowerPC T10x2 processor (2-4 e5500 cores) up to 1.5GHz or a PowerPC T2081
  processor (4 dual-threaded e6500 cores with Altivec 2.0) up to 1.8GHz, both designed
  by NXP in The Netherlands. It supports DDR3 memory, PCIe 2.0 (3.0 for the 4x slot
  when using the T2081), SATA and NVMe, the usual array of USB 2.0 and 3.2 ports,
  audio jacks, Ethernet, and so on. No, this is not a massive powerhouse that can
  take on the latest x86 or ARM machines, but it&#8217;s more than enough to power
  Amiga OS 4 or MorphOS, and aims to be actually affordable. Being at the prototype
  stage means they&#8217;re not for sale quite yet, but the fact they have a 100%
  yield so far and are comfortable enough to send one of the prototypes to a MorphOS
  developer, who then got MorphOS booting rather quickly, is a good sign. I also like
  the focus on affordability, which is often a problem in the Amiga world. I hope
  they make it to production, because I want one real bad.'
