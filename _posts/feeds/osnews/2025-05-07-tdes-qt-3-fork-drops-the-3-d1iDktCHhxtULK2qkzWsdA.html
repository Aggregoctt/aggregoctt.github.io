excerpt: The Trinity Desktop Environment, the continuation of the final KDE 3.x release
  updated and maintained for modern times, consists of more than just the KDE bits
  you may think of. The project also maintains a fork of Qt 3 called TQt3, which it
  obviously needs to be able to work on and improve TDE itself, which is based on
  it. In the beginning, this fork consisted mainly of renaming things, but in recent
  years, more substantial changes meant that the code diverged considerably from the
  original Qt 3. As such, a small name change is in order. TQt3 was born as a fork
  of Qt3 and for many years it was little more than a mere renaming effort. Over the
  past few years, many changes were made and the code has significantly diverged from
  the original Qt3, although still sharing the same roots. With more changes planned
  ahead and with the intention of better highlighting such difference, the TDE team
  has decided to drop the &#8216;3&#8217; from the repository name, which is now simply
  called &#8216;TQt&#8216;. ↫ TDE on Mastodon The effect this has on users is rather
  minimal &#8211; users of the current 14.1.x release branch will still see 3s around
  in file paths and package names, but in future 14.2.x releases, all of these will
  have been removed, completing the transition. This seems like a small change, and
  that&#8217;s because it is, but it&#8217;s interesting simply because it highlights
  that a project that seems relatively straightforward on the outside &#8211; maintain
  and carefully modernise the final KDE 3.x release &#8211; encompasses a lot more
  than that. Maintaining an entire Qt 3 fork certainly isn&#8217;t a small feat, but
  it&#8217;s kind of required to keep a project like TDE going.
