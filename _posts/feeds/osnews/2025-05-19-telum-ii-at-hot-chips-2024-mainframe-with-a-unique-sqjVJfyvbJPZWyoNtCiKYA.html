excerpt: Mainframes still play a vital role in today, providing extremely high uptime
  and low latency for financial transactions. Telum II is IBM’s latest mainframe processor,
  and is designed unlike any other server CPU. It only has eight cores, but runs them
  at a very high 5.5 GHz and feeds them with 360 MB of on-chip cache. IBM also includes
  a DPU for accelerating IO, along with an on-board AI accelerator. Telum II is implemented
  on Samsung’s leading edge 5 nm process node. IBM’s presentation has already been
  covered by other outlets. Therefore I’ll focus on what I feel like is Telum (II)’s
  most interesting features. DRAM latency and bandwidth limitations often mean good
  caching is critical to performance, and IBM has a often deployed interesting caching
  solutions. Telum II is no exception, carrying forward a virtual L3 and virtual L4
  strategy from prior IBM chips. ↫ Chester Lam at Chips and Cheese If you&#8217;ve
  been keeping track, you can possibly deduce that I&#8217;m bit of a sucker for IBM&#8217;s
  mainframes and big POWER machines. These Telum II processors are absolutely wild.
