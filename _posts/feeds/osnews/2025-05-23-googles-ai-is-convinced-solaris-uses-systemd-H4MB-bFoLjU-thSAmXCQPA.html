excerpt: Who doesn&#8217;t love a bug bounty program? Fix some bugs, get some money
  &#8211; you scratch my back, I pay you for it. The CycloneDX Rust (Cargo) Plugin
  decided to run one, funded by the Bug Resilience Program run by the Sovereign Tech
  Fund. That is, until &#8220;AI&#8221; killed it. We received almost entirely AI
  slop reports that are irrelevant to our tool. It&#8217;s a library and most reporters
  didn&#8217;t even bother to read the rules or even look at what the intended purpose
  of the tool is/was. This caused a lot of extra work which is why we decided to abandon
  the program. Thanks AI. ↫ Lars Francke On a slightly related note, I had to do search
  the web today because I&#8217;m having some issues getting OpenIndiana to boot properly
  on my mini PC. For whatever reason, starting LightDM fails when booting the live
  USB, and LightDM&#8217;s log is giving some helpful error messages. So, I searched
  for "failed to get list of logind seats" openindiana, and Google&#8217;s automatic
  &#8220;AI Overview&#8221; &#8216;feature&#8217;, which takes up everything above
  the fold so is impossible to miss, confidently told me to check the status of the
  logind service&#8230; With systemctl. We&#8217;ve automated stupidity.
