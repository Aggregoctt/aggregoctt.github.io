  <p>Justin Bieber’s awkward caption on a post about wife Hailey’s <em>Vogue</em>
  cover has fans questioning his timing and intentions.</p>

  target="_blank">Hailey Bieber</a>’s first <em>Vogue</em> cover should have been
  an easy win. The model and Rhode beauty founder stunned in the feature, cementing
  her spot at the center of fashion’s minimalist moment. However, what should’ve been
  a celebration quickly turned sideways, thanks to her husband, Justin Bieber.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In what some on social media called a "cringe" move, Justin posted a congratulatory
  message that quickly veered into overshare territory. Rather than simply praising
  Hailey’s achievement, he recalled a fight from early in their relationship.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Yo this reminds me [of] when Hailey and I got into a huge fight," he wrote in
  his Instagram caption. "I told hails that she would never be on the cover of <em>Vogue</em>.
  Yikes I know, so mean.”</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While he later apologized in the same caption, admitting his words were hurtful
  and rooted in feeling "disrespected," the damage had been done. Many fans felt the
  post pulled focus away from Hailey’s moment. Instead of centering her success, the
  caption centered on Justin’s own past regret.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Unsurprisingly, the internet had strong reactions. "Justin 😭 idk if this is how
  you say congrats to your wife lol," one commenter wrote. Another chimed in, "Take
  this down! You oughta be ashamed embarrassing this lady."&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Some fans even questioned the health of their relationship, with one person on
  X, formerly Twitter, writing, "heterosexual relationships are scary because why
  is your husband your biggest opp." Another added, "who needs enemies when you have
  a husband who secretly hates you."</p>

  <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Tweet that reads, &quot;When
  you see Justin going to Hailey’s events wearing sweats and Crocs, it’s not because
  that’s his style. it’s because he doesn’t see those events as important. He appears

  <p>Although a few defended him for being honest, the overwhelming reaction skewed
  critical. As one fan noted, "This caption is not it… but congrats to @haileybieber."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Many more were quite critical, however. "The power and aura she would gain if
  she just spontenously dumped his ass cannot be overstated," wrote <a href="https://x.com/Mod_Charissa/status/1924885130574692363"

  <p>Eventually, Justin appeared to walk back the post''s caption. By late afternoon
  on May 20, the original caption was replaced with a string of emojis: 🤷🫵🏻🫶🏼🥹, a
  shrugging man, a pointing finger, heart hands, and a tearing up and smiling emoji.
  The majority of folks in the comments called his edit a "cop-out" and scoffed at
  what they considered a very basic, simple caption change to cover up his true feelings.</p>

  landed poorly for many. His reflection, though seemingly sincere, felt oddly timed
