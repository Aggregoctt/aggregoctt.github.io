  <p>A syringe of facial filler, which can add volume to areas of the face that appear
  sunken, can cost over $1,000 at a licensed provider. Now, some people are skipping
  the professionals by injecting themselves to save money on the popular beauty treatment.</p>

  <p>In the comments of Grace''s video, many viewers warn that DIY-ing injectables
  can be dangerous.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Hi so maybe… don’t? Please go to the doctor''s office to paralyze parts of your

  <p><a href="https://www.shaferplasticsurgery.com/">Dr. David Shafer</a>, a New York-based
  plastic surgeon, recently spoke to the Daily Dot about the <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/pop-culture/fake-botox-how-to-spot-it/">dangers
  of at-home injectables</a> and fake Botox, saying, “Patients often don’t know what
  is being injected into them. So, they don’t know if they were injected with fake
  Botox.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), these counterfeit injectables
  can cause side effects like blurred vision, incontinence, shortness of breath, and
  weakness.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Dr. Shafer also shared the <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/pop-culture/fake-botox-how-to-spot-it/">symptoms
  to look out for</a> from his perspective with the Daily Dot: </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Worrisome symptoms would be trouble breathing, weakness, vomiting, fatigue,
  change in vision, difficulty swallowing, and pain in areas such as the abdomen. These
  could be signs of Botulism poisoning, which could occur if fake Botox was administered
  in exponentially wrong doses. Other signs would be no effect, as the fake Botox
  may not even contain Botulinum toxin, which is the active ingredient of Botox.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The FDA warns consumers not to use fillers and Botox sold directly to customers.
  Instead, they suggest seeking out a licensed medical professional for their beauty
  treatments.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“If the price is too good to be true, then it’s not genuine Botox Cosmetic,”
  Dr. Shafer <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/pop-culture/fake-botox-how-to-spot-it/">concluded</a>.</p>
