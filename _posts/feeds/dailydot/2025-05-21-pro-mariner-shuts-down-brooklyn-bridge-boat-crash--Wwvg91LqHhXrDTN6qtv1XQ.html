  <p>After the Mexican Navy training ship Cuauhtémoc collided with New York City''s
  Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday Night, speculation quickly veered into conspiracy theories.
  However, one seasoned mariner, known on TikTok as Captain Boomies (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@captainboomies/video/7506188098619903262"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">@captainboomies</a>), stepped in to offer
  a sobering, experience-based analysis of what likely went wrong.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In her breakdown, she dismissed shady theories and explained the tall ship wasn''t
  actually trying to pass under the bridge at all. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The Cuauhtémoc, she explains, met strong currents and a possible mechanical issue
  trying to back out of the South Street Seaport, a tragedy that resulted in two cadet
  deaths (América Sánchez and Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos) and 19 injuries of the 277
  people on board.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Immediately shutting down viral theories, @captainboomies began, "I need to cut
  off some conspiracy theories real quick." With 25 years of maritime experience,
  much of it in New York Harbor, she explained the ship never intended to pass beneath
  the bridge at all. Instead, it had been backing out of its slip at the South Street
  Seaport.</p>

  <p>Importantly, tall ships like the one involved have very limited options when
  docking in <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/new-york-city/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">New York City</a>. "If they’re gonna visit New York,"
  she said, "that’s kind of it." South Street Seaport is one of the few viable locations
  available, even though it’s uncomfortably close to the bridge.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She suspected that the ship became stuck in reverse while attempting to leave.
  A docking tug boat was present, but such tugs typically help with orientation during
  departure, not with full-scale towing. This minor detail made a major difference
  when strong currents got involved.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-perfect-storm-of-tide-current-and-delay">A
  perfect storm of tide, current, and delay</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Conditions on the East River are notoriously difficult. "The East River is gnarly
  when there’s a lot of current," she noted. After checking tide charts, she confirmed
  that the current could have reached speeds of up to three knots during the incident.
  That is enough to shove a vessel into the bridge, even if it wasn’t under power.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Meanwhile, many questioned why crewmembers didn’t climb down from the spars sooner.
  That, too, had a simple answer. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Descending from a <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/ships/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">tall ship</a>’s rigging isn’t quick. "You have to shimmy
  along little toe ropes literally meant for your toes to be on and clip in and out
  as you go and get down," she explained. In emergencies, that process could take
  longer than the window between realizing something’s wrong and hitting the bridge.</p>

  <p>The ship that hit the Brooklyn Bridge probably had a combination of things working

  <p>Tragically, that delay may have cost the crew the chance to clear the rigging
  in time. Yet even amid the aftermath, @captainboomies emphasized that the maritime
  community treats these events seriously. "Anytime something like this happens… You
  bet we revaluate how we do things and why we''re doing them."</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/tiktok/" rel="noreferrer noopener"

  just a complex collision of navigational challenges, mechanical issues, and tough
