  <p>Most gardeners know black coffee can <a href="https://www.almanac.com/coffee-grounds-for-plants">revitalize</a>
  a dying plant, providing nutrients and deterring pests. Can sugary coffee do the
  same thing? One man swears by this old family secret after using an iced brown sugar
  shaken espresso <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/folgers-coffee-around-house/">coffee</a>
  from Dunkin’ on two dying trees in his yard.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>“This is borderline black magic. I don''t even know if I should be telling you
  this,” gardener Jesse (@brickbybricks) tells his 1.6 million viewers. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He shows a tree that has visible signs that it''s dying: browning leaves. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“If you have a tree looking like it’s about to die, like this guy, all you need
  is a very sugary, espresso-filled drink, and it will bring them back,” he explains,
  holding a medium iced brown sugar shaken espresso from Dunkin’. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“I found that these brown sugar shaken espressos work really well. This is like
  the Sabrina one?” he says, referring to Dunkin''s collab with the pop star. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The creator then dumps the coffee onto the leaves instead of the roots. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Pop this open, get some at the roots,” he says. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Afterward, Jesse turns his attention to another withered tree with completely
  discolored leaves. “This one is, like, dead-dead, so we’re gonna do this one, too.
  We’re gonna pit this one more at the base,” he adds, pouring the rest of the drink’s
  contents at the bottom of the tree. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He is adamant that this trick works. “I think you guys are under the impression
  that I’m very much not joking. Check back with me in two months. They’re both gonna
  be green and healthy. Mark my words,” he concludes.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Old family secret,” he shares in the caption.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The Daily Dot reached out to Jesse via TikTok comment and direct message.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“How much did Dunkin pay to start this rumor?” one viewer asked.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“I feel like I''ve heard of people using used coffee grounds for plants, but
  I don''t know,” another stated.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“In order for us to believe you, you have to make this a series, you have to
  report back at least weekly,” a third remarked.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“So you’re gonna replace them.. GOT IT,” a fourth said.</p>

  <p>Contrary to what Jesse is proclaiming, different outlets advised against this.
