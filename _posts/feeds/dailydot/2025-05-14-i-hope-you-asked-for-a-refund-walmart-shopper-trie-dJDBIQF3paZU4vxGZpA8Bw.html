  <p>A <strong>Walmart </strong>worker shared that stores experienced an overwhelming
  demand for the cupcake bouquets after they went viral, leading to some supply issues
  on Mother''s Day weekend.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-walmart-cupcake-bouquet-and-why-did-it-go-viral">What
  is the Walmart cupcake bouquet, and why did it go viral? </h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Walmart''s bakery offers colorful "flower bouquets" made up of 12 cupcakes for
  special occasions, like Valentine''s Day. The cupcake flowers sit on top of a piece
  of decorative cardboard that is made to look like a vase. The vase structure gives
  the bouquet a three-dimensional effect, creating the illusion that it is a real
  bouquet. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Several Walmart workers and customers with large followings have <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/walmart-cupcake-flower-bouqet/">posted
  videos featuring these elaborate bouquets to TikTok</a>. The bouquets are not just
  beautiful, but they are pretty affordable at $20. Those two factors, coupled with
  the fact that Mother''s Day weekend was May 9 through May 11, led to them recently
  going viral. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-substitution">Substitution</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Walmart clearly wasn''t expecting for them to go as viral as they did. Stores
  struggled to keep up with an influx of orders Mother''s Day weekend. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>One customer who was impacted by this showed in a viral TikTok the substitution
  she received after ordering a cupcake bouquet for Mother''s Day. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She ordered a pink, orange, yellow, and red bouquet for pick up on May 10. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As it turns out, her Walmart ran out of the supplies to create these bouquets—namely,
  the cardboard vase—and had to improvise. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The customer said in a TikTok comment that she received a call from a Walmart
  worker who filled her in on their dilemma and gave her a few options: They could
  cancel the order and issue her a refund or make do with what they had on hand. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The customer chose the latter option, and she shared what the bakery worker came
  up with in the second part of her slideshow. The result is a more cake-like-looking
  bouquet, featuring 11 cupcakes glued down to a cake box in the shape of the bouquet.
  The worker got creative, making the flower''s stems out of frosting. They still
  managed to add a bow to the design, "tying" together the flower''s stems. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The color scheme is exactly what the customer initially ordered—pink, orange,
  yellow, and magenta. And the bakery worker completed their creation with a few cake
  toppers—two butterflies and one that reads "Happy Mother''s Day."  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>@jhernandez180 was pleased with the final product and appreciated the effort
  that went into crafting it. "They honestly did an amazing job," she wrote. </p>

  </h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A Walmart worker offered further insights on her own TikTok account about some
  of the supply issues. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"If you get a text message from Walmart this weekend saying your order''s been
  canceled for the cupcake bouquet, it''s literally because we don''t have the boxes,"
  she shared. "It''s out of our control. There''s no way to get any more."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The worker claimed that one store alone had to cancel 75 orders. "So if you happen
  to get a text message or an email, it''s nothing personal. I wish we could do every
  order that''s come through, but unfortunately we''ve had to cancel a lot," she said.
  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She added that Walmart was "not prepared" for the virality of the bouquets and
  subsequent influx of orders. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I know it''s Mother''s Day weekend, but we literally can''t do nothing about
  it. So, hope everybody has a happy Mother''s Day. To the ones that did get their
  bouquets. Congratulations," she said. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As of Tuesday, the cupcake bouquets were no longer available to order on Walmart''s
  site. </p>
