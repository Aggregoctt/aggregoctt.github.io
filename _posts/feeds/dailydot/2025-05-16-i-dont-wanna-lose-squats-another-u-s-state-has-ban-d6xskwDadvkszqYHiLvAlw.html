  <p><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/arkansas/">Arkansas</a> recently joined
  a growing number of states cracking down on squatted <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/trucks/">trucks</a>.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Known for their jacked-up front ends and lowered rear ends, these trucks are
  easy to spot—and now illegal on Arkansas roads.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As of April 13, it’s officially against the law in Arkansas to raise the front
  bumper of a vehicle more than four inches higher than the rear.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The ban specifically calls out suspension, chassis, and frame modifications,
  and it comes with penalties: a $250 fine for the first offense, $500 for the second,
  and a one-year license suspension after the third.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-are-squatted-trucks-so-controversial"><strong>Why
  are squatted trucks so controversial?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Critics cite <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/safety/">safety</a> as the
  primary reason. Raising the front too high can block the driver’s vision, mess with
  balance, and increase braking distance. There’s also the issue of blinding headlights
  aimed at oncoming cars.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-online-reactions-are-mixed"><strong>Online reactions
  are mixed</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/tiktok/">TikTok</a>, one of the more
  popular videos about the ban comes from @brett.michealss, a mother-son duo known
  for their truck content.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The video, which has over 747,000 views, shows the mom jokingly narrating her
  son’s efforts to "unsquat" his truck before the ban takes effect.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“He tried to hide it from me,” she says in the video. “We’re putting a tracker
  in the truck so he doesn’t leave the driveway. We’re taking his keys. We’re even
  kicking him off the insurance.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She adds, “Oh, I’m so happy they’re banning these trucks.”</p>

  <p>Viewers, however, were divided in the comments.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Everywhere should ban squatted trucks,” one person said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Finally, he can’t say he’s country ‘cause he got the squat a truck now,” another
  joked.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But not everyone agreed: “Nooooooo I don’t wanna lose squats,” someone else wrote.</p>
