  <p>The ACE Family''s Catherine McBroom has accidentally inspired a new meme known
  as the Catherine Method after her ex-husband revealed a series of bizarre messages
  she sent.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-is-catherine-mcbroom">Who is Catherine McBroom?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Catherine McBroom was best known for her role in the ACE Family, a wildly popular
  YouTube channel she ran with her now ex-husband, Austin McBroom. Together, they
  built a controversial influencer empire based on picture-perfect family content
  with plenty of drama brewing under the surface.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The two <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/194ex4h/catherine_from_the_youtube_channel_ace_family/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> in 2024 that the seemingly
  happy couple had "mutually agreed to a divorce"¬† less than four years after officially
  getting married. The ACE Family has been back in the spotlight recently after <a
  href="https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/1921705047219442141" rel="noreferrer noopener"
  target="_blank">pages</a> allegedly from Catherine''s upcoming book leaked online
  and revealed her ex-husband''s infidelity‚Äîsomething he confirmed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oNahybyna8"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">via Snapchat</a> in May.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-did-the-catherine-method-come-from">Where
  did the Catherine Method come from?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As part of Austin''s response to his infidelity being outed, he shared that Catherine
  had started <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/austin-mcbroom-accuses-catherine-paiz/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">regularly doing ayahuasca</a>. He further
  claimed that this "spiritual journey" had caused hallucinations that included thinking
  Austin was a mermaid and that Catherine herself was the reincarnated Virgin Mary.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"You guys put yourself in my shoes, and if your significant other told you that
  they were the Virgin Mary and that they no longer wanted to have sex with you, what
  would you do?" he asked.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This led to him showing viewers a message Catherine allegedly sent to someone
  she met on one of these ayahuasca retreats that was nothing more than a series of
  strange images.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"What does that mean? What type of language is that?" Austin asked in a clip
  of the video that was ultimately reposted to TikTok and became the basis for the
  <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/memes/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">meme</a>.</p>

  Catherine Method meme?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Although Austin was looking for sympathy and understanding in sharing his side
  of his infidelity story, viewers took something else from the whole thing‚Äîespecially
  when it came to that viral clip.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"i also had an ex so horrible i went into spiritual psychosis," reads one of
  the top comments.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>It didn''t take long for that snippet to inspire what has since been dubbed the
  "Catherine Method," which involves sending someone a series of seemingly random,
  strange photos. The sender then shares the results with TikTok, often with the audio
  of Austin sounding confused laid over it.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p>Mostly, the Catherine Method seems to be used in good fun‚Äîa playful way to see
  how a significant other might respond to something that makes little to no sense,
  or to try to reel in a crush with absolute chaos.</p>
