  <p>That food you''re eating may not be what it seems—and that''s exactly how the
  companies want it. An advertising worker broke down what it means when foods say
  they are made "with 100%" beef or chicken.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Many people find food in the U.S. questionable. From ultra-processed snacks designed
  to be addictive to chicken breast that is suspiciously large, it''s hard to navigate
  the grocery aisle with a level of confidence in what you''re buying (not to mention
  how <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/shrinkflation/">shrinkflation</a> has
  chipped away at quantity while prices go up).</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Labels like <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/misleading-nature-of-natural-labels-on-food-7499305">"natural"</a>
  and <a href="https://www.newrootsinstitute.org/articles/how-cage-free-egg-claims-may-be-deceptive">"cage-free"</a>
  can be misleading. While the government technically regulates food safety, its oversight
  is fragmented and full of loopholes. <span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The
  FDA lets food manufacturers determine what ingredients are "generally recognized
  as safe" (GRAs) and decide whether or not to disclose an ingredient''s underlying
  safety data, <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/august/legal-loophole-unsafe-ingredients.html"
  target="_blank">NYU reported</a>.</span></p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On top of that, the U.S. allows additives, preservatives, and dyes that are banned
  in Europe and other countries.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But advertising worker Luke (@lukegreatguy) is here to reveal a trick you can
  use to understand what a food label is really saying.</p>

  <p>His video has more than 407,000 views. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I learned something that now I can never unsee," Luke says in his video.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While eating a bag of beef jerky, Luke noticed it said "Made with 100% beef."
  He says it reminded him of a tidbit he learned a while ago.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Luke explains that he works in advertising. He says he was once on a project
  with McDonald''s that revealed so much about food labels.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">He points out that "made with" is a
  "funny twist of words," because it means the product was made <em>with </em>100%
  beef, not<em> </em>100% beef.</span></p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>With McDonald''s, he says it claimed its chicken nuggets were made with 100%
  chicken. But there''s more in those nuggets than that, according to the ingredients
  list on the McDonald''s site. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"There''s a lot of other stuff in there, and some of it might not be 100% chicken.
  But it''s made with 100%," he says. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Still tastes good," Luke adds as he pops a piece of jerky in his mouth.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

  <li><strong>Titanium Dioxide</strong>: a food coloring found in candy, soups, and
  baked goods, it often appears on a label as “artificial color." Studies have found
  it can have cancerous effects. (Though in 2023, the World Health Organization and
  United Nations group stated it doesn''t pose a health risk.)</li>

  <p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

  <li><strong>Food dyes (Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Red No. 40)</strong>: These can

  <p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

  <li><strong>Potassium Bromate</strong>: This is used in foods like flour, bread,
