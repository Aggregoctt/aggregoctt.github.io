  <p>A woman was devastated to learn her "emo" <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/apple/">Apple</a>
  profile picture was being emailed to employers. And in an 8-second <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/en/">TikTok</a>
  video that garnered over 8.8 million views, she detailed the distress she felt as
  a result of this discovery.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Louise (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lou.igi">@lou.igi</a>) records herself
  looking down at her phone with her hand over her mouth. Additionally, her eyes are
  opened wide in a bulging display of shock as she presumably stares down at her device.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Next, her video transitions to displaying the profile picture in question. The
  man in her photo has mascara on, and he''s rocking a mass of long black hair. Adorning
  the top of his crown is a <a href="https://funender.com/lifestyle/how-long-is-medium-length-hair-in-emo-style.html">side-swept
  </a>style, and it appears he has some purple dye mixed into his black-tinted follicle
  aesthetic.</p>

  <p>The TikToker writes in a text overlay of her video, "I didn''t realize my Apple
  pfp was visible to others. I''ve been emailing employers with this picture." To
  make matters worse, she shows off what appears to be the email application on an
  iOS device. Inside the application and beside one of her messages, is indeed the
  emo profile picture in question.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apple-profile-picture-and-how-to-change-it">Apple
  profile picture—and how to change it</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Furthermore, it seems other folks who use products manufactured by the Cupertino-based
  tech company also have this issue.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In an Apple community forum, one user <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253650131?sortBy=rank">recently
  penned</a> that they wish "local user account photo[s]" weren''t connected to Apple
  ID photos. Additionally, they stated an Apple Store employee "confirmed" other customers
  had this same issue.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Moreover, if you''re interested in changing your Apple profile picture, the company
  recommends <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/change-your-photo-mm362334de5e/icloud">the
  following steps</a>. Users should head to <a href="http://icloud.com/settings">iCloud.com/settings</a>,
  and then input their username and password if they aren''t already logged in.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Following this, users need to head to iCloud settings and click/tap on Change
  Apple Account Photo. Next, they should simply drag and drop the new desired picture
  into the photo field. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Also, users can tap/click "browse your device for a new image." This will direct
  them to different file directories where they can select a new image. After they''ve
  picked their new profile photo, all they have to do is click save to avoid the same
  aforementioned scenario Louise experienced.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-embarrassing-emails-to-employers">Embarrassing
  emails to employers</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this inadvertent phenomenon has occurred to many folks whilst
  sending emails. One Samsung Galaxy S3 user stated that they "noticed (with horror)"
  they''ve been sending emails with what is presumably an embarrassing profile photo.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The picture, they noted, was tied to <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/unauthorisedunwanted-profile-photo-appearing-on-my/1604f867-7baf-4f05-ab92-a10cb75bac54">Microsoft''s
  Live service</a>, but they didn''t remember setting it as such. Moreover, it appears
  that their phone automatically tethered whatever avatar they selected on their Galaxy
  phone to their Microsoft Live account.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Additionally, <em><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/embarrassing-work-email-mistakes_n_5beefe74e4b0b052597a59a9">HuffPost</a></em>
  published a list of different email gaffes sent out to folks in a professional environment.
  Like this US embassy worker in Australia who "sent out a cat photo instead of a
  meeting invite."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Then there was this employee who, thanks to a cut-and-paste gaffe, ended up writing
  an unsavory phrase into a work email: </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another worker mistakenly shared their love for UB40''s track "Red Red Wine"
  <a href="https://twitter.com/CleverTitleTK/status/1047097049857101825">with a colleague</a>.
  Yet another person shared a meme instead of sending <a href="https://twitter.com/__apf__/status/923763522869149696">building
  plans to a contractor</a>.</p>

  pic woes</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On the legal side of things, there was an employee who was miffed that management
  demanded they have a profile picture. They asked if it was all right for their online
  presence to be represented by the company''s logo. So they shared their concerns
  on an <em><a href="https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/can-an-employer-force-you-to-have-a-photograph-tak-1939430.html">Avvo</a></em>
  forum, where a lawyer informed them "terms of employment can change."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Consequently, the concerned worker''s supervisor could indeed mandate that they
  have a professional work photo taken and attached to their corporate profile.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Moreover, this <em><a href="https://www.inc.com/jt-odonnell/my-boss-told-me-my-profile-picture-is-embarrassing.html">Inc.</a></em>
  column piece featured an employee who was told their company''s profile picture
  was "embarrassing." According to the worker, their boss reached out to them after
  Human Resources expressed concern over their LinkedIn headshot. The HR rep stated
  the image made the worker look "childish" and demanded that they change it to a
  more professional-looking one.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On the flip side, the same article comes at the issue from a manager''s perspective.
  They stated that while they could understand the worker is trying to look "funny"
  in their picture, they saw HR''s point regarding professionalism. Additionally,
  they said that while a job can''t force an employee to change their social media
  pictures, it ultimately isn''t a good look.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-commenters-react">Commenters react</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>With regards to Louise''s post, however, numerous folks couldn''t help but giggle
  at her gaffe. "This genuinely made me laugh so hard," one said. Another echoed,
  "I can''t stop laughing."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Whereas someone else said that if they saw an email come in with this profile
  picture attached, it''d leave a good impression. "I’d hire yon ON THE SPOT," they
  penned.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>There were other users who shared their own embarrassing employer email missteps.
  Like this person who said, "If it makes you feel better, I got hired with my email
  name as ''biggie cheese.'' And not once have any of my coworkers inquired about
  it..I WORK AT A HOSPITAL," they wrote.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But there was at least one commenter who wondered why Louise was unaware that
  her Apple profile picture wasn''t public, asking, "Why would your pfp NOT be visible
  to others?"</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>And someone else found the comedy in seeing a full-blown resume rocking this
  profile picture. "Imagine a full, serious resume with this profile picture."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The Daily Dot has reached out to Louise via TikTok comment for further information.</p>
