  <p>A <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/pregnancy/">pregnant woman</a> got angry
  with her brother after he baked her a <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/gender-reveal/">gender
  reveal</a> cake. The problem? It was missing the whole gender reveal part. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Redditor @MilktheAlgorithm is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ki8455/aita_for_making_my_sisters_gender_reveal_cake/">the
  baker in question</a>. He explains why he was forced to go with the genderless dessert
  in the r/AmItheAsshole subreddit on Thursday. </p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-a-gender-reveal-cake">What is a gender
  reveal cake? </h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A gender reveal cake, once cut into, should feature a color that indicates what
  the gender of the baby is. It''s become a fun and simple way for loved ones or even
  the expectant parents to find out the gender of the baby. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>For example, if parents chow down on a cupcake, and it''s filled with pink sprinkles,
  frosting, or even the cake sponge itself, they can assume they are having a girl.
  The outside of the cake should not feature pink or blue so that the element of surprise
  is maintained. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The results of the ultrasound are usually folded up and given to whoever is in
  charge of baking or coordinating the cake. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>At least, that''s what @MilktheAlgorithm thought. The problem is, however, he
  says that he never received the information. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He says he loves baking "as a hobby." But, he says, he''s gotten so good at it
  that he makes cash doing so. "I get paid under the table for weddings and baby showers,"
  he writes.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-familial-request">Familial request</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>After OP''s sister became pregnant, he says she messaged him asking if he could
  whip her up a gender reveal cake. He says this wasn''t an issue, and all she had
  to do was send him the information indicating the gender. This was so he could "prep
  the inside-classic pink or blue filling."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>His sister, he says, informed him that she "want[ed] to be surprised too." OP
  thought that this was a strange request, but his sister explained that she wanted
  a "neutral" cake, he says. Following this, she told him that someone would send
  him the information at a later time.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, OP says "that someone never did." OP then says that a few days before
  the gender reveal, he asked his sister "if the info had been sent." He says she
  assured him that "someone''s taking care of it." He never received the gender reveal
  info.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This put him in a position where he needed to either "go full improv" and guess
  the gender or make a neutral cake. OP chose the latter and ended up making a cake
  that "tasted great, but visually [looked] "grim as hell."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-grey">The grey</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As OP puts it, the cake ended up giving "full on cement vibes." And coupled with
  his sister''s request for a neutral cake, he says he made it all grey. The exterior
  frosting was grey. Its cream on the inside was grey. Although he did concede that
  he "added little fondant clouds for effect."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Upon unboxing the cake, his sister upset, and "her husband [was] confused," he
  recalls. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She assumed his decision was "passive-aggressive," he continues. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He says he informed her that despite asking her more than once about the gender
  information, he never received it. That didn''t seem to make matters better between
  him and his sister. And their mom also told him that she thought he "should''ve
  tried harder" and that he ended up embarrassing his sister "in front of the family."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Toward the end of his post, he wanted other Redditors on the r/AITA post to chime
  in on the incident. Was he in the wrong "for making the most neutral reveal cake
  in history?"</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-commenters-divided">Commenters divided</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>One user on the application asked him if he had followed up, and the Redditor
  clarified again that he indeed did. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I figured it was handled. I didn''t want to pester her since she seemed chill
  about it at the time," he says. OP then adds that if his sister "really wanted the
  gender in the cake, she could''ve double-checked too." </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Furthermore, he states that he "was relying on the system that she set up." Unfortunately,
  he adds, that system "just didn''t come through."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, someone else thought that making the cake grey was indeed a "passive
  aggressive" move. Instead, they said he could''ve opted for any other neutral color,
  such as white. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Others thought "a sad cement vibes prison looking cake" was a mean move to pull
  on his sister. Someone else echoed this sentiment, writing he "could''ve used any
  other bright fun color under the sun."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While a grey cake may set a stark tone for a gender reveal, others online are
  arguably worse. Like this one dad who <a href="https://cafemom.com/parenting/dad-punching-baby-bump-in-strange-gender-reveal">repeatedly
  punched mitts</a> held by his pregnant wife. Instead of a light tapping resulting
  in a cloud of pink- or blue-colored smoke, he had to slam the mitts forcefully a
  few times. Subjecting a visibly pregnant woman to getting struck in the hand a couple
  of times, which made viewers uncomfortable.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>And then there was this couple who decided to use the explosive <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/explosion-hampshire-quarry-latest-gender-reveal-stunt-wrong/story?id=77276836">compound
  tannerite in their gender reveal</a>. While starting anything "out with a bang"
  is generally considered a good thing, this wasn''t the case. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That''s because it appears that too much of the compound was used. Consequently,
  the surrounding area, including at least one person''s home, was purportedly damaged
  due to the reveal.</p>
