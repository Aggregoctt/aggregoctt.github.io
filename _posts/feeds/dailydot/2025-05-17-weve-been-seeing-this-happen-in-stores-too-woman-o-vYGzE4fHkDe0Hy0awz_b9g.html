  <p>There was something <strong>deeply wrong</strong> with this woman''s <strong>Lululemon</strong>
  order. Commenters think they know what happened.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Love it or hate it, Lululemon has solidly cemented itself as one of the most
  recognizable names in athleisure, growing from a niche yoga-wear company to a global
  powerhouse with a cult following.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Known for its high prices, great leggings, and creative marketing, <a href="http://dailydot.com/tags/lululemon">Lululemon</a>
  has become more than a clothing brand. It''s a class and lifestyle symbol associated
  with well-off, wellness-obsessed millennials and Gen Zers.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But with popularity comes scrutiny. Lululemon has faced its fair share of controversies,
  from <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/businessmain/lululemon-complaints-stretch-beyond-quality-customer-service-8c11514726">quality
  control</a> issues to <a href="https://prismreports.org/2021/04/08/lululemon-talks-the-talk-but-doesnt-walk-the-walk-on-fighting-anti-asian-racism/">racist</a>
  leadership.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>And here''s one more thing to add to the list.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lululemon-set-catches-fire">Lululemon set catches
  fire?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a viral video with more than 4.3 million views, content creator Darian Kaia
  (@dariankaia) showed how shocked she was by her Lululemon order, and not in a good
  way. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Kaia explained that before her wedding, her husband gifted her an all-white Lululemon
  that she could sport ahead of the wedding. She loved the idea so much that she ordered
  he same thing for her little sister, who''s getting married in less than two months,
  and wanted to give it to her for her upcoming bridal shower.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But when she went to grab the package at the door, her once excited face dropped,
  and she looked visibly confused.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Oh my gosh, is it on fire?" Kaia exclaimed when she saw the package.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"No, no, no, no, no, no," she went on as she picked it up.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The plastic bag in which the items came had a huge hole in it that looked like
  it had melted off.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As she examined it further, Kaia''s heart sank. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"The jacket''s ruined too," she said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>When she brought the item up to the camera, a large grey mark with two holes
  appeared on the pristine white fabric.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Kaia said the situation made her want to cry, especially since it''s a bit of
  a hassle to acquire Lululemon because there isn''t a store nearby, so all orders
  have to be placed online. On top of that, Kaia had been waiting for the item to
  restock. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I do not know what I''m gonna do now. I guess I''m just gonna have to give her
  mine," Kaia said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-lululemon-address-the-situation">Did Lululemon
  address the situation?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a follow-up video, Kaia explained that after a day and a half, she was able
  to get in contact with "the sweetest" customer service rep in Florida, who got the
  item replaced and shipped out. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-was-it-really-burnt">Was it really burnt?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a comment, Kaia said that she found out the damage likely came from the package
  getting stuck on a conveyor belt in the shipping facility or getting stuck in the
  delivery truck door.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While the item didn''t get burned in the traditional sense, it could be a friction
  burn.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-commenters-react">Commenters react </h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"If you gift her yours (until hers arrives) it can be her something borrowed,"
  a top comment read.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"The fact that we spend that much money with a company and they can‚Äôt figure
  out a better packaging is absolutely ridiculous!" a person said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I work for UPS and packages like this get stuck in belts ALL THE TIME. it‚Äôs
  crazy companies like this don‚Äôt have better packaging," another wrote.</p>
