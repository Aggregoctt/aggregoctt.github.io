  <p>One woman has a simple hack for all white car drivers who find their vehicle
  more scuffed up than they''d like. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Ashley (@sasshlleeyy) shared her newly discovered method for getting rid of scratches
  on her white Toyota Rav 4 in a trending TikTok. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Her secret weapon? A Mr. Clean Magic Eraser. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Her video has garnered over 2,000 views since she posted the clip on Sunday.
  However, many commenters were wary of her method.  </p>

  white cars the hardest to keep clean?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I have a PSA for all my girlies with white cars," Ashley says in the video.
  "If somebody has dinged your door a little bit and left marks—I just feel like my
  car accumulates marks so easily."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Many people think white cars show the most imperfections and are hardest to keep
  clean. However, several experts <a href="https://zappysautowashes.com/blogs/news/what-are-the-easiest-and-hardest-car-colors-to-keep-clean#:~:text=The%20easiest%20car%20colors%20to,they%20show%20stains%20very%20easily.">argue</a>
  that white cars may be the easiest, depending on where you live. Take 5 <a href="https://www.take5.com/blog/these-are-the-best-car-colors-to-hide-dirt-and-other-imperfections/">notes</a>
  that white vehicles'' reflective nature causes scratches, scuffs, and other blemishes
  to be less visible to the human eye. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Still, scuffs can still be a nuisance for white car drivers like Ashley. And
  she found a solution that''s sitting in many people''s cleaning cabinets. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"A Magic Eraser will get rid of this," Ashley says as she scrubs a dark gray
  scratch off her vehicle''s door with the Mr. Clean product. "And I don''t know how
  I didn''t know this sooner, but it literally works wonders. Brand new. Insane."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-magic-erasers-work">How do Magic Erasers
  work?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The main ingredient in Mr. Clean Magic Erasers is melamine foam, a sponge-like
  structure made from melamine and formaldehyde. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While Magic Erasers may appear to be a simple sponge, they''re more complex than
  the eye can see. And that complexity is why they''re so effective at cleaning. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The microstructure of melamine resin in foam form is incredibly hard, almost
  as hard as glass. As Jessika Toothman <a href="https://home.howstuffworks.com/magic-eraser.htm#pt1">explains</a>
  for How Stuff Works, this leads a melamine sponge, like the Magic Eraser, to operate
  more like very fine sandpaper than a sponge. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Believe it or not, the "magic" removal of stains isn''t magic at all. Rather,
  the stains are simply being scrubbed away by the fine grit of the foam. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, the science of melamine sponges led many commenters to warn Ashley about
  using a Magic Eraser on her car''s paint. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Melamine is just a high grit sandpaper, it’ll get the job done but you’re risking
  the paint when you remove the clear coat. Just rub it off with a cloth and water
  lol," one viewer commented.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Your just scratching the scratch even deeper and removing the color the first
  scratch left," another wrote. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Ashley responded, "Somehow I think I’ll live. It did what I needed it to do [shrug
  emoji]."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-a-magic-eraser-safe-to-use-on-your-car">Is
  a Magic Eraser safe to use on your car?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Magic Erasers can be used on vehicles, but only if they''re used carefully. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Applying too much pressure on a car with a melamine sponge can cause damage to
  the vehicle''s paint or clear coat. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"It is pretty difficult to damage something with a Magic Eraser, assuming you''re
  using it with a little bit of common sense," Luke Wilson of Wilson Auto Detailing
  explains. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a YouTube <a href="https://youtu.be/2Foi1juG6tI?si=_A6t0M2owyacZQbU">video</a>,
  he shows the cloudy abrasion to a car''s paint that overuse of a Magic Eraser can
  cause. It''s a result of "micro-scratches" to the clear coat, he says. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, Wilson also shows how to fix the scratches left behind, in case you''ve
  taken a melamine sponge to your vehicle one too many times. </p>

  <p>In the same clip, Wilson takes a bit of polish and a microfiber towel to the
  Magic Eraser damage. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He works the polish into the blemish by hand with quick circles for about 45
  seconds. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"It''s totally finished, totally gone," Wilson says, showing off the car, which
  no longer has the cloudy abrasion spot. </p>
