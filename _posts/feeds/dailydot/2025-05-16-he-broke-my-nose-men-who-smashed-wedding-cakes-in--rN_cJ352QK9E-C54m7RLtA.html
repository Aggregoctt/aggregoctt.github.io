  <p>An Ask Reddit post may close the debate on whether it''s a good idea to smash
  wedding cake into your new spouse''s face at the reception. Long a subject of viral
  videos, this newlywed <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/pranks/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">prank</a> could predict future divorce, if the comments
  are any indicator.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Although the headline may draw divorced people more than those who are happily
  married, the strong majority of responses suggest that the cake smash prank is a
  bad idea.</p>

  target="_blank">Reddit</a> user invited cake face smashers and their victims to
  a post on May 11, 2025, over 3,700 commenters came forward to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1kkholl/people_who_smashed_the_wedding_cake_into_your_new/"

  <p>According to <em><a href="https://www.rd.com/article/history-of-wedding-cakes/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Reader''s Digest</a></em>, the tradition
  of newlyweds feeding each other began in Ancient Rome. Eating just a few crumbs

  acts as a married couple."</p>
