  <p>President Donald Trump''s plan to accept a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar
  has triggered unexpected backlash from within his own base. Prominent MAGA personalities
  like <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/laura-loomer/" rel="noreferrer noopener"
  target="_blank">Laura Loomer</a> and <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/ben-shapiro/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Ben Shapiro</a> are denouncing the plan,
  citing concerns about Qatar''s ties to groups like Hamas and its broader relationship
  with Iran, alongside other national security risks.  </p>

  <p>Lesser-known <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/donald-trump/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">Trump</a> fans spoke up on X, with a few expressing concerns
  about the President''s safety. Others opposed accepting the gift not on any constitutional
  grounds, but because they''re not fans of Qatar.</p>

  <p>Qatar is an Iranian ally and allowed senior Hamas officials in the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/qatar-hamas-doha-us-request/index.html"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">capital of Doha</a> until November 2024.
  They don''t tend to count fans among pro-Israel Trump supporters. Fox News host
  Mark Levin agreed with Loomer, quote-tweeting her post with the word "Ditto." He
  may have gone against <a href="https://x.com/FoxNews/status/1921975996481187965"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">his network</a> in doing so, considering
  the network''s X account repeatedly posted President Trump''s denials of wrongdoing.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Daily Wire host Ben Shapiro dedicated an episode of his podcast to
  opposing Trump''s plan. Right-wing political commentator Ian Miles Cheong posted
  a clip from this episode without offering his own opinion.</p>

  <p>"Taking sacks of goodies from people who support Hamas, Muslim Brotherhood, Al

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The big names weren''t the only ones feeling a strain on the limits of their
  loyalty to Trump. While crowds of MAGA accounts defended the President, a few expressed
  that they are not 100 percent on board. Most of this dissent centered on their distrust
  of Qatar, leaning more into the national security concerns than the constitutional
  ones.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I don’t trust Iran and I don’t trust Hamas," wrote <a href="https://x.com/jessalanfields/status/1921731661940568260"

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Some fans can''t get their heads around this particular contradiction. One MAGA
  user pointed to Rep. Ilhan Omar''s (D-MN) acceptance of a <a href="https://www.startribune.com/financial-disclosure-shows-ilhan-omar-trip-to-world-cup-funded-by-qatar-government/600298940"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">trip to Qatar</a> in 2023 to attend the
  World Cup, which led some conservatives to claim that Omar alone must be a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2786184/ilhan-omar-a-qatari-asset-who-passed-secrets-to-iran-florida-court-told/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Qatari asset</a>.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Why would Qatar both fund Ilhan Omar and gift a $400 million plane to President
  Trump?" asked <a href="https://x.com/EYakoby/status/1921651641620590942" rel="noreferrer

  <p>Some might remember the hullabaloo over the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/emoluments-clause-trump-jet-qatar-56f995acb57eb741b0214aba5e7e8220"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Emoluments Clause</a> of the U.S. Constitution
  during Trump''s first term. Back then, Democrats were outraged that he was profiting
  by hosting world leaders in his hotels. Those profits likely added up to less than
  $400 million and were not a direct gift like the sky palace would be.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This part of the Constitution prohibits federal officials from accepting anything
  of value from foreign governments without the approval of Congress. The current
  Congress has not approved of accepting the plane, and Trump''s defense for accepting
  it anyway boiled down to, "Why not?"</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer," he said to reporters.
  "I mean, I could be a stupid person say, ‘No, we don’t want a free, very expensive
  airplane.’ But it was—I thought it was a great gesture."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He further claimed that the gift would be to the U.S. Department of Defense,
  not to him personally. This may be undermined by his additional claim that it would
  be decommissioned and given to a presidential library after his second term is up.
  Constitutional scholars do not appear satisfied by Trump''s explanations.</p>

  <p>“This is a classic example of what the founders worried about,” University of
