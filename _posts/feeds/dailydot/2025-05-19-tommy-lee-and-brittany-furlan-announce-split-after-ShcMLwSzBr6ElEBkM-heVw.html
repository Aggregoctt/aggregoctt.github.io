  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee and influencer Brittany Furlan have ended their
  marriage after six years amid a bizarre catfishing scandal.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The couple, who married on Valentine’s Day in 2019, had reportedly been facing
  issues for some time. Last week, Furlan checked into a hotel, signaling that something
  serious was going on behind the scenes. On May 15, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/05/15/tommy-lee-and-brittany-furlan-break-up-source-says-his-drinking-the-issue/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>TMZ </em>reported</a> that the couple
  had split, citing Lee’s struggles with sobriety as the reason, according to a source
  close to the pair.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, things took a strange turn just one day later.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tommy-lee-s-cryptic-instagram-post-sparked-speculation">Tommy
  Lee’s cryptic Instagram post sparked speculation</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On May 16, Tommy Lee posted a vague Instagram post that read, "Who’s been catfished?"
  Fans were immediately confused, but that post opened the floodgates for what came
  next.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Ronnie Radke, the lead singer of Falling in Reverse, took to his Instagram Story
  to clarify that he had never communicated with Brittany Furlan. Instead, he claimed
  she had been messaging a <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/catfishing/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">catfish </a>pretending to be him, and it had gone far
  beyond a few innocent DMs.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Radke shared screenshots showing that Brittany had liked his shirtless photos
  and had messaged him back in March. He also posted proof that he never responded.
  Things escalated when, allegedly, Furlan showed up at his home and even contacted
  his attorney. According to Radke, she messaged his ex-girlfriend and followed him
  to a medspa, where she supposedly had no appointment. His Stories were recorded
  and shared by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJvDWSwoAX9/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">@someinamillion</a>. </p>

  <p>In his own words, Radke called the situation "weird" and said he believed Furlan
  was being dishonest about her intentions and involvement. Radke posted a video showing
  his app purchase history from 2017, revealing he''d never downloaded Snapchat. “I
  don’t have a Snapchat,” he said. “I’ve never had a Snapchat guys.”</p>

  <p>Understandably, Tommy Lee was not pleased. Radke claimed Lee had reached out
  in anger, thinking his wife was having an affair with the singer. After learning
  the truth, Radke suspected that Furlan might have leaked the drinking story to <em>TMZ
  </em>as a distraction.</p>

  <p>On May 17, Brittany Furlan broke her silence with a seven-minute TikTok video.
  In it, she admitted to messaging a fake Ronnie and confessed that she had been talking

  <p>"Because I’m a good person. I mean, I’m not a good person for talking to someone
