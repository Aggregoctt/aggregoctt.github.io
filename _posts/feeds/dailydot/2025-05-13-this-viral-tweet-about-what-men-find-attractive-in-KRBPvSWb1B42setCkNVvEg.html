  <p>A tweet from <a href="https://x.com/meghaverma_art" rel="noreferrer noopener"
  target="_blank">@meghaverma_art</a> claiming a certain style of dress is "actually
  attractive to men" has lit up the platform and launched days of discourse, largely
  because it turned into women either gassing up or poking fun at their husbands''
  replies. "I asked my husband to send me a dress he found attractive and received
  this" has become a phrasal template on the app, derailing the original premise and
  turning it into a meme.</p>

  <p>The dresses in the tweet—which racked up nearly 15 million views and 10,000 likes—are
  feminine and modest, below-the-knee-length powder pink and blue, with princess silhouettes,
  drapery, and tulle. (Though the account does not outwardly label itself as tradwife,
  <a href="https://x.com/meghaverma_art/status/1921850054798696856" rel="noreferrer

  and <a href="https://x.com/meghaverma_art/status/1921772540122550723" rel="noreferrer

  <p>"These are the kind of dresses that are actually attractive to men. Because they
  accentuate the hip to waist ratio, while being classy and elegant. They are just
  sexy enough to be attractive and flattering, but not crass or cheap looking," reads
  the caption.</p>

  <p>Fairly quickly, folks began putting @meghaverma_art''s thesis to the test. "I
  asked my husband to send me a dress he found attractive and received this," wrote
  <a href="https://x.com/zplerhop/status/1921205602233053334" rel="noreferrer noopener"

  black pleather minidress with a plunging back. Their tweet massively outranked the
  original, amassing over 200K likes. </p>

  <p>Writer <a href="https://x.com/1followernodad" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sophia
  Benoit</a> put it best in a quote-reply to a tweet suggesting men send a photo of
  just a dress, rather than a model wearing it: "I literally cannot imagine living
  a life like this where everything is a minefield for you and you don’t understand
  your partner at all and they also hate you."  </p>
