  <p>Self-proclaimed "boy mom" Jessica Tapscott (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jtapscott"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">@jtapscott</a>) is catching both heat
  and praise after surprising her son at his college bar in a now-viral TikTok video.
  Tapscott, known for sharing family moments on the platform, posted a clip of herself
  partying with her visibly uncomfortable son and his friends. The video quickly racked
  up over 3.7 million views and nearly 4,000 comments of varying opinions. </p>

  <p>The video''s text overlay reads, "The one time I showed up at the club to surprise
  my son at college.” In it, Tapscott gleefully records herself with a drink in hand.
  Meanwhile, her son is sitting nearby with his hood up, avoiding eye contact and
  looking down at his phone.</p>

  <p>Although some viewers assumed the video was staged for laughs, many felt secondhand
  embarrassment for her son. "Boy moms are so scary I swear to god," one commenter
  wrote. Another added, "The secondhand embarrassment I feel for him."</p>

  <p>Despite the hate, a few users defended the mom’s antics. One person argued, "It’s
  so clearly a joke and he’s SO clearly in on it.” Another praised the dynamic: “Y’all
  HATE to see a mom and son who actually enjoy each other’s company—it’s crazy."</p>

  say "boy mom" culture is crossing the line</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While the "boy mom" label started as a simple description for moms of sons, it
  has evolved into a more loaded term. Increasingly, critics accuse the trend of bordering
  on obsessive or inappropriate parenting.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"How are you not embarrassed?! Boy moms are something else for real 😭," wrote
  @ana.jamanka.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Meanwhile, @anaavillalobos noted, "the only positive thing about these videos
  is that they teach me how not to be when I become a boy mom lol."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Ultimately, Tapscott’s <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/tiktok/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">TikTok</a> video added fuel to an already heated discussion.
  While some appreciated the humor and closeness, others viewed it as an uncomfortable
  display of boundary-blurring behavior.</p>

  <p>In a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jtapscott/video/7505017001228651806" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">follow-up video</a>, she posted a lip sync video of herself
  singing, "I know you''re obsessed with me," seemingly poking fun at haters in her
  comments. Some folks defended her, calling what she did a "harmless prank" on her
  son, who was probably just as much of a jokester growing up.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"NEED people to understand that women over 40 can make jokes and, in fact, make
  a funny little video," one commenter pointed out. "Guarantee that if a dad did this
  to his son, these people would understand it’s a harmless prank/joke video. Keep
  being a fun mom!" </p>
