  <p>One small Easter egg in <em>The Paper</em> has reignited fansâ€™ excitement about
  the future of <em>The Office</em> universe.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><em>The Paper</em> <a href="https://ew.com/the-office-spinoff-the-paper-release-date-cast-11733911"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">premieres on Peacock</a> in September.
  It is a mockumentary-style comedy set in a struggling Ohio newsroom. Created by
  Greg Daniels, the original showrunner behind the U.S. version of <em>The Office</em>,
  this new series follows the staff of <em>The Truth Teller</em>, a dying newspaper
  in Toledo, OH.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore lead the cast, with <em>Office</em>
  alum Oscar NuÃ±ez reprising his role as Oscar Martinez. According to the official
  logline, the same documentary crew from Dunder Mifflin has now turned their lens
  on a Midwestern newsroom and its hopeful publisher.</p>

  <p>While early reactions have been cautious, one TikTok user has found a glimmer
  of promise buried in a promotional still, and fans took notice.</p>

  spots subtle <em>The Office </em>callback giving fans hope</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>TikToker Kyle Philippi (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kylephilippi/video/7504510109448473887"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">@kylephilippi</a>) shared a detailed breakdown
  of the first released image from <em>The Paper</em>, highlighting what he called
  "a small detail" that gave him real hope.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"One, you can see the Dunder Mifflin paper box," he noted, referencing a clear
  prop nod to the original series. But something even more subtle got his attention.
  In the background, Oscar Martinez sits at a desk with the same gift Michael Scott
  gave him in his farewell episode.</p>

  <p>"That they are already putting in <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/easter-eggs/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Easter eggs</a> in the very first pictureâ€¦
  optimistically hopeful that this is gonna be good," Philippi said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This kind of attention to continuity has long-time viewers feeling cautiously
  optimistic. After all, Daniels and fellow <em>Office</em> co-creator Ricky Gervais
  are both involved. This suggests a level of care that could elevate the spinoff
  beyond simple nostalgia bait.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fans-on-tiktok-are-feeling-carefully-excited">Fans
  on TikTok are feeling (carefully) excited</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>TikTok users responded enthusiastically to the video, many echoing Philippiâ€™s
  excitement. Several comments mentioned how the callback to Michaelâ€™s gift was a
  touching reminder of <em><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/the-office/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">The Office</a></em>â€™s emotional core.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"The minute I saw that little doll I cackled and said aww ðŸ˜‚," one commenter wrote.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Others were encouraged by the showâ€™s creative team. Still, some expressed measured
  expectations. As Philippi pointed out, "I know itâ€™s not gonna be <em>The Office</em>â€¦
  but I think if itâ€™s successful enough, it will maybe lead to more characters showing
  up."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Basically, this blend of new setting, old faces, and heartfelt callbacks might
  be the formula this spinoff needs. As Philippi put it: "Please be good. Please be
  good. Please be good."</p>
