  <p>There''s nothing quite like watching your favorite artist under the summer sun.
  However, getting the tickets can be a long and arduous journey. Sites like Ticketmaster
  either crash or only sell tickets at an absurdly expensive price. And then comes
  the problem of scalpers, who snag all the best tickets before you can even get a
  look in and resell them at extortionate rates.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Now, Live Nation seems to be fighting back against these issues as the company
  makes summer tickets more accessible than ever. The company''s "30$ Ticket to Summer"
  promotion pretty much does what it says on the tin: offering concert tickets for
  some of your favorite artists at an absolute steal of a price.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Some of the most notable artists included in this deal include Thomas Rhett,
  Avril Lavigne, Billy Idol, Little Big Town, Simple Minds, "Weird Al" Yankovic, Willie
  Nelson, The Black Keys, James Taylor, Cyndi Lauper, Kesha, The Doobie Brothers,
  Toto and Christopher Cross and Men at Work, Halsey, Styx and Kevin Cronin Band,
  The Offspring, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Pantera, Luke Bryan, Nelly, Rod Stewart, and
  Keith Urban, among others.</p>

  <p>The "30$ Ticket to Summer" event starts on May 21 and will continue while stocks
  last. According to TODAY.com, Rakuten and T-Mobile customers will get exclusive
  early access to this deal. They''ll get access from 10am ET on May 20.</p>

  <p>Additionally, while Live Nation''s Lawnie Pass scheme has wound down, pass-holders
  will still be able to get early access to the event. </p>

  <p>From May 21, users will be able to visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.livenation.com/promotion/tickettosummer"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">LiveNation.com/TicketToSummer</a> to see
  the full roster of events and artists. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The first step is to select the event you''re interested in. Next, toggle the
  $30 Ticket to Summer ticket option. Then, it''s just a matter of adding your ticket
  to the basket and checking out. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>If there isn''t a $30 Ticket to Summer ticket option, that means you''ve either
  selected an event that isn''t part of the deal or the event ended up selling out.
  If it''s the latter, it''s worth keeping an eye on the website in case more tickets
  are released.</p>
