  <p>Klarna, the Swedish "buy now, pay later" fintech company, used an AI-generated
  version of its CEO to deliver bad news about customer loan repayment rates.</p>

  aren''t Klarna customers repaying their loans?</h2>

  <p>According to the <a href="https://s205.q4cdn.com/644747736/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-25-Klarna-Earnings-Release.pdf">press
  release</a>, which was accompanied by the AI video, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/klarna/">Klarna</a>
  customer credit losses from failing to repay loans rose to 17% in Q1 of 2025. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The "buy now, pay later" microloan platform allowed customers to purchase everyday
  items from <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/klarna-for-doordash-is-a-bad-idea/">DoorDash</a>,
  Walmart, eBay, and more. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, a <a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/personal/buy-now-pay-later-loan-statistics/">survey
  by LendingTree</a> found that 41% of American customers paid their loans late within
  the last year. </p>

  <p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91337167/klarna-q1-2025-earnings-buy-now-pay-later-ai-ceo-losses">Fast
  Company</a> reported that this drop in repayment may be linked to plummeting consumer
  confidence. Cost of living remained high in Q1, and fears of tariffs continued even
  after the most recent 90-day pause. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Klarna customers may have used the microloans to stretch their budget, making
  repayment less of a priority.</p>

  Klarna customers discussed why they haven''t repaid their "buy now, pay later" loans.
  Many said their defaulted loans haven''t been reported to the credit bureaus.</p>

  <p>"They just have a debt company email you everyday other week lol it doesn''t
  hit your credit," a Redditor claimed.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Used them for years and had to default over a year ago and nothing was ever
  reported," another said.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I''ve had klarna for years and recently couldn''t pay them back it''s been a
