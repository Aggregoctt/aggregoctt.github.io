  <p>The 2025 Pride collection from Levi''s drew concern from some reviewers for its
  emphasis on Holocaust imagery without education. Many of the items on sale this
  year contain the pink triangle that Nazis forced victims to wear to label them as
  queer. While many LGBTQ+ folks appreciated something other than rainbow logos, others
  felt that the symbol warranted a little context.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Levi Strauss &amp; Co. does have a history of supporting the LGBTQ+ community
  and even rejected anti-DEI efforts from the Trump administration this year, but
  a little blurb about what the triangle means would be extra helpful during a difficult
  time for the community.</p>

  very plain, without any hint of <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/pride/" rel="noreferrer

  the Holocaust felt a little weird without any kind of explanation as to where those

  <p>In the video, Connor Clary explains that the pink triangle originates from Nazi
  Germany, which used these symbols to label the approximately 15,000 gay men they
  sent to their concentration camps. Gay rights activists reclaimed it in the 1980s
  during the AIDS crisis to criticize then-President Ronald Reagan for his silence
  on the epidemic.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>With such a bloody history, Clary feels unsettled by the fact that Levi''s used
  the symbol without providing context in the product descriptions.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I would be very hesitant to support a corporation that''s using that iconography
  sans any kind of awareness or education as to why it exists in the first place,"
  he said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Clary points to the "Pride community tee" that reads "united for freedom our
  diversity is our strength" within an upside-down pink triangle. The description
  notes the yearly Levi''s donation to Outright International, but mentions no history.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"If they''re going to use a symbol that has such a heavy and dark history, I
  would love if they would just provide some kind of context as to why it''s there
  or give voice to the people who were impacted by the history of both the Holocaust
  and the AIDS epidemic—survivors of which are still here today."</p>

  <p>Commenters on Clary''s video often agreed that Levi''s should have included this

  company based on recent actions or insisted that people should already know the
  context behind the symbol.</p>

  <p>Clary responded to the latter commenter by saying he grew up in Missouri, where

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I grew up in Missouri and most people in the Midwest don’t really know the history

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-levi-s-chooses-diversity">Levi''s chooses diversity</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Levi''s has a history of supporting the LGBTQ+ community beyond its yearly Pride
  collection, though this underscores questions about why they failed to take any
  steps toward simple education around a symbol they are profiting from.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to <a href="https://sustainabilitymag.com/articles/99-of-levis-shareholders-vote-to-stand-resolute-on-dei"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sustainability Magazine</a>, over 99 percent
  of Levi''s shareholders voted to uphold its DEI programs in the face of pressure
  from the Trump administration. On April 23, 2025, they held the vote in response
  to a request from right-wing think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research
  (NCPPR).</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The tank asked shareholders to "consider abolishing its DEI program, policies,
  department and goals." Levi''s Board of Directors advised a "no" vote, and shareholders
  overwhelmingly complied.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"We''ve been committed to diversity and inclusion for literally decades, and
  it''s the core to who we are," said Levi''s President and CEO Michelle Gass. "So
  our commitment remains unchanged."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“We will do what''s right for our people, for our business. And at the end of
  the day, building a diverse and inclusive workplace helps us deliver stronger results."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The company also partnered with San Francisco–based tattoo artist José Luis Sanabria
  this year to create eight embroidered patches and four stamps, according to <a href="https://sourcingjournal.com/denim/denim-brands/levis-historic-queer-symbols-2025-pride-collection-dei-1234748180/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sourcing Journal</a>. These will be available
