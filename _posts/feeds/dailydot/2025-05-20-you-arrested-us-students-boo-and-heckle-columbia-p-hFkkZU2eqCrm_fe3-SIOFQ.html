  <p>Columbia University has been the scene of many pro-Palestinian demonstrations
  in recent months (and since April 2024), including a sit-in at the school''s main
  Butler Library. Protests came to a head on May 8, 2025, when the New York Police
  Department (NYPD) showed up and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce929l5z2ldo"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reportedly arrested over 70 protestors</a>.</p>

  <p>Student protestors have long been demanding that Columbia financially divest
  from companies with ties to the Israeli government and Israeli companies over its
  actions in Gaza.</p>

  <p>In a clip posted to X by Jessica Schwalb (<a href="https://x.com/jessicaschwalb7/status/1924856186991431725"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">@jessicaschwalb7</a>), students can be
  heard yelling "you arrested us!" at Shipman.</p>

  <p>In another of Schwalb''s videos, students can be heard chanting "FREE MAHMOUD!"
  in reference to Mahmoud Khalil, a student activist leader and green card holder
  who was arrested <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/mahmoud-khalil-protest-trump-tower/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">and remains in detention</a> after being
  taken from his New York City apartment building by Immigration and Customs Enforcement
  (ICE) agents in March 2025.</p>
