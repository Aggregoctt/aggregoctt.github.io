  <p>You''ll never guess who this woman sat next to on her flight. Hint: it''s not
  a celebrity but is someone equally as shocking.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>It''s the luck of the draw who you end up next to on a flight. It may be that
  cute person you were eyeing at the gate (though it rarely is), a chatty Cathy, or
  a stoic business person trying to squeeze in some work on the flight.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Generally, you just hope they''re a good seatmate and don''t have to think much
  of them.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But that wasn''t the case for this woman, who bonded with her flight partner
  after finding out they had more in common than they ever thought.</p>

  discover a strange connection</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a viral video with more than 2.6 million views, content creator Caroline Dunlap
  shared the wild experience she just had on a work flight.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"This is probably one of the craziest things that''s ever happened to me," Dunlap
  said. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the video, Dunlap explained that she was flying back home to New York after
  a work trip. Sitting on the flight scrolling and doing some work tasks, the flight
  kept getting delayed, so Dunlap decided to strike up a conversation with the guy
  next to her, who was about her dad''s age (50s/60s).</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>During the 2.5-hour delay, they chat about everything from what they do for work
  to where they''re from. When the flight attendants deplane them (the aircraft never
  took off), Dunlap and her seatmate chill at the gate a bit longer while they decide
  what to do. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the meantime, he watches her stuff while she goes to the bathroom and even
  brings her snacks during his snack run.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>They do eventually make it back on the plane, and at that point, they''re "homies,"
  as Dunlap put it, and keep the convo going, this time going more into life and politics.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>At one point, he shows her pictures of his family, and Dunlap looks at the pictures,
  shocked.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"You guys ... I know this man," Dunlap said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-how">What?! How?!</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Will and I had a three-month situationship the first summer that I moved to
  D.C. And it did not end well, and not on my end. And I''ll leave it at that."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While Dunlap was a bit hesitant, she ended up revealing to her seatmate that
  she used to see his son but spared him the details about his son as a dating partner.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"We die laughing. Like cracking up," Dunlap said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The dad took a picture and sent it to his son and recounted the story.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Instead of texting Dunlap something lighthearted, the son was abrasive and told
  her to leave his dad alone.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"You never know who you''re sitting next to y''all. You never know who you''re
  gonna meet in the wild," Dunlap said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"TALK TO STRANGERS LMAO," Dunlap.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"It’s so embarrassing when people aren’t as cool as their parents lol," the top
  comment read.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Date his dad. get married. now he’s your stepson," a person urged.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"No cause I''d be texting back ''what an odd thing to say to your future stepmom,''"
  another added.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Leave my dad alone is a crazy response. you dodged a bullet. which is such a
  bummer for the romcom we wanted this to turn into," a commenter wrote.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Plot twist: dad starts inviting you to family functions and not Will," a person
  chimed in.</p>
