  <p>YouTubers <strong>Austin McBroom</strong> and <strong>Catherine Paiz</strong>,
  who ran the channel <strong>ACE Family</strong> before their divorce in 2024, are
  throwing <strong>accusations</strong> at each other following the release of Paiz''s
  memoir.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-did-paiz-write-about-mcbroom-in-her-memoir">What
  did Paiz write about McBroom in her memoir?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a snippet from her memoir, <em>Dolores</em>, Paiz accuses <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/irl/youtube-austin-mcbroom-tiktok-hits-daughter/">McBroom</a>
  of cheating and "emotional betrayal" during their <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/ace-family-accidentally-uploaded-footage/">marriage</a>.
  She recounts the moment she discovered "proof" of McBroom''s affair.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"He''d already broken his vows," she writes. "He''d already been gone from me,
  longer than I had known."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The snippet has garnered sympathy on social media, as rumors of McBroom''s alleged
  infidelity were previously ignited when the couple announced their divorce. However,
  Paiz and McBroom remained private about their divorce and continued what seemed
  like a healthy, co-parenting relationship.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-did-austin-mcbroom-respond-to-the-accusations">How
  did Austin McBroom respond to the accusations?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In <a href="https://x.com/PopCrave/status/1922235439991140638/video/2">a public
  statement</a> recorded after the release of Paiz''s memoir, McBroom attempts to
  clear the air. He claims that he had permission to engage sexually with other women
  and that Paiz was aware of his relationships.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"When it comes to me stepping out of my marriage, I did," he says. "But when
  it comes to her acting like she had no idea what was going on, that''s a complete
  lie."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Beyond pushing back on Paiz''s claims, McBroom accuses his ex-wife of engaging
  in "unlicensed" Ayahuasca ceremonies. Ayahuasca is a psychedelic beverage frequently
  used in spiritual practices in South America. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"It got so bad to the point she was doing it once a month," he claims. "She became
  addicted."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He continues to allege that after their separation, Paiz began hosting ceremonies
  around their children. He alleges that a 12-year-old boy engaged in one of the ceremonies
  at Paiz''s home.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>McBroom says he considered applying for full custody.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Despite McBroom''s accusations, many viewers believe he is "deflecting."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Not him deflecting with ayahuasca when he was busy doing adultery olympics,"
  an X user wrote.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Textbook manipulator move: deflect, distract, and say absolutely nothing," another
  said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Not the deflection-," a third commented.</p>
