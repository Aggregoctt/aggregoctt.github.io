  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The Iced Horchata Oatmilk Shaken Espresso combines the smooth and beloved Starbucks
  Blonde Espresso with oat milk and horchata-flavored syrup. The addition of the syrup
  reportedly produces a sweet vanilla, cinnamon, and lightly nutty flavor.</p>

  <p>The base of the two Summer-Berry Refreshers is "a sweet and summery blend of
  raspberry, blueberry and blackberry flavors shaken with ice and water, poured over
  raspberry flavored pearls." The Summer-Berry Lemonade Refresher contains lemonade
  while the Summer Skies Drink contains coconut milk. </p>
