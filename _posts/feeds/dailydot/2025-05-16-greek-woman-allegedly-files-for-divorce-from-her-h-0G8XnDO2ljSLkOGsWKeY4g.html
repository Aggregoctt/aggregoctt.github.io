  <p>In a bizarre turn of tech meets tradition, a Greek woman trusted ChatGPT to read
  coffee grounds and expose her husband’s alleged affair.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-tasseography-causes-divorce-drama">ChatGPT’s
  ''tasseography'' causes divorce drama</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to reports from <a href="https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/04/26/greek-woman-files-for-divorce-after-chatgpt-reads-husbands-affair-in-coffee-cup/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>Greek City Times</em></a>, the unnamed
  mother of two took a photo of the leftover grounds in her husband’s coffee cup and
  uploaded it to ChatGPT. She asked the AI to analyze the image using tasseography,
  which is a traditional fortune-telling method that interprets patterns in tea leaves
  or coffee grounds.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Though ChatGPT isn’t designed for mysticism, the woman took its response seriously.
  The AI allegedly "read" the coffee remnants and suggested her husband was not only
  thinking of cheating, but already involved with a woman whose name began with "E."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The results had immediate, real-world consequences. Rather than shrug off the
  strange result, the woman reportedly confronted her husband of 12 years. Not only
  that, she told their children they were getting divorced and called a lawyer. All
  based on the AI''s reading.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-husband-speaks-out-this-wasn-t-just-a-phase">Husband
  speaks out: ''This wasn’t just a phase''</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Her husband later appeared on the Greek morning show <em>To Proino</em>, where
  he shared his side of the story. He revealed this wasn’t the first time his wife
  had been influenced by her supernatural beliefs. "A few years ago, she visited an
  astrologer, and it took her a whole year to accept that none of it was real," he
  told the show.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Still, he never expected AI to be the tipping point in their <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/relationships/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">marriage</a>. "I laughed it off as nonsense,
  but she took it seriously. She asked me to leave, told our kids we were getting
  <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/divorce/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">divorced</a>,
  and then I got a call from a lawyer. That''s when I realised this wasn''t just a
  phase."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Despite her demands, the husband refused a mutual separation. However, within
  three days, a lawyer served him with formal divorce papers. His legal team is now
  pushing back, arguing that <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/chatgpt/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>’s claims have no legal basis. They are insisting
  he’s "innocent until proven otherwise."</p>

  <p>The story quickly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/1khqzr8/greek_woman_files_for_divorce_after_chatgpt_reads/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reached Reddit</a>, where users couldn’t
  resist commenting. Many were baffled by the woman''s reliance on AI for fortune-telling.
  One user joked, "Now AI is taking the jobs of [tarot] readers too."</p>
