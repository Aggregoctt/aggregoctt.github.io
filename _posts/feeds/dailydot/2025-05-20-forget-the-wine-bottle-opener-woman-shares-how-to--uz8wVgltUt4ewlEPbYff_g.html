  <p>A surprising viral hack for uncorking wine bottles has caught the internet''s
  attention. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>In a video, <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/using-flat-iron-uncork-wine-195906853.html">reposted
  by Yahoo News</a>, a woman places the top of a corked wine bottle inside a flat
  iron. After a few moments of applied heat, the cork begins to rise slowly—eventually
  popping out gently into her hand.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>“When life gives you wine but no corkscrew, just straighten things out,” the
  text overlay quips.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>The woman appears both shocked and thrilled when the cork finally gives way.
  She never even had to use a wine bottle opener.</p>

  wine bottles trick</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>This is not the first viral clip to showcase the strange yet effective uncorking
  method.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>In a video with over 3.9 million views, TikTok user Hayley (@pop.tart22) also
  demonstrates the trick. In her version, she uses a pink flattening iron to warm
  up the bottle’s neck, gradually forcing the cork out.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>The trick works by using heat to expand the air trapped between the wine and
  the cork. As the air warms, it increases pressure inside the bottle, slowly pushing
  the cork upward. It’s a clever workaround when a corkscrew isn’t on hand—but users
  should take care, as too much heat or rapid pressure change could cause the glass
  to crack or even shatter.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>Many online viewers have praised the hack not just for its ingenuity but for
  how easily it can be done with a common household item.</p>
