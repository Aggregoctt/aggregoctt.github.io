  <p>Polyglot YouTuber Xiaoma, known for speaking dozens of languages with people
  around the world on his channel of over 6.6 million subscribers, is facing backlash
  after giving a high school speech in what he described as "Gen Alpha slang." The
  speech was meant to inspire appreciation for language, but critics called it culturally
  insensitive and appropriated African American Vernacular English (AAVE).</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Many students at the event laughed along with Xiaoma, a 34-year-old millennial,
  as he converted a standard high school graduation style address into a style of
  speaking that pulled words from AAVE. Some of the other students, though, did not
  seem entertained. </p>

  <p>People commented that the speech was a microaggression. The general sentiment
