  <p>Is this woman‚Äôs transparent phone a simple solution for a modern problem? Or
  is it potentially a sign of how technology is destroying society?</p>

  <p>A TikToker<a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/18/lifestyle/internet-baffled-by-bizarre-glass-phone/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> is insanely viral</a> after filming a
  woman in line at a boba shop holding a mysterious, cellphone-shaped piece of glass.
  In the comments, users joked that it‚Äôs a new transparent cellphone.</p>

  <p>As it turns out, there is a much simpler (although maybe still just as odd) explanation
  for the phenomenon. According to the<em><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/18/lifestyle/internet-baffled-by-bizarre-glass-phone/">
  New York Post</a></em>, this is called a methaphone, which is a $25 slab of acrylic
  that is designed as a ‚Äústand-in‚Äù for a cellphone.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The company behind the methaphone, Mindless Toys, describes it as an alternative
  to cellphone use similar to a nicotine patch. ‚ÄúNow you can step down your dependency
  on your mobile device with this,‚Äù the site reads.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>You can basically do everything with the methaphone that you‚Äôd do with a regular
  cellphone: Put it in your pocket, stare blankly at it in line at the tea shop, and
  misplace it. The only thing it lacks is a motherboard.</p>

  <p>This is an art project by New York City engineer and artist <a href="https://grex.nyc/"

  whose projects often contemplate the impact of the internet on human existence.</p>
