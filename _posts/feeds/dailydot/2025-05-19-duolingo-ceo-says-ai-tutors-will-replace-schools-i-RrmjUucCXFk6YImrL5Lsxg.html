  <p><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/duolingo/">Duolingo</a> CEO Luis von Ahn
  is making headlines after suggesting that Artificial Intelligence (<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/ai/">AI</a>)
  will one day replace classroom teachers entirely.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to von Ahn, schools of the future won’t be about <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/education/">education</a>—they’ll
  mostly serve as childcare centers.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He shared his take in a recent <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4qCX9uw3tHBgaAFqMFfrAB">episode</a>
  of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0O65xhqvGVhpgdIrrdlEYk"><em>No Priors</em></a>,
  a podcast hosted by investor Sarah Guo. “Education is going to change,” he said.
  “It’s just a lot more scalable to teach with AI than with teachers.”</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-would-this-future-actually-look-like"><strong>So
  what would this future <em>actually</em> look like?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Von Ahn made it clear that he doesn’t think schools won’t disappear entirely,
  but their main function may shift.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“That doesn’t mean the teachers are going to go away,” he said. “You still need
  people to take care of the students. I also don’t think schools are going to go
  away because you still need childcare.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He pointed to the challenges that come with having one teacher for a room of
  30 or more kids. Meanwhile, AI can tailor lessons on an individual level.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“The computer can know very precisely what you’re good at and bad at—something
  a teacher just can’t track for 30 students at once,” he said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In his view, students in the future might “Duolingo” their way through customized
  lessons, with teachers stepping in as facilitators instead of traditional instructors.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Still, he admitted that this shift might not happen overnight.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Education is slow to change,” he said, citing government red tape, outdated
  systems, and social norms as obstacles.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-online-users-aren-t-exactly-sold-on-the-idea"><strong>Online,
  users aren’t exactly sold on the idea</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/reddit/">Reddit</a>, a post about von
  Ahn’s comments quickly drew backlash, especially from longtime Duolingo fans.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“The more this guy talks, the less I like Duolingo,” one commenter wrote.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another person pointed out the mismatch between Duolingo’s fun, chaotic brand
  and the CEO’s opinions.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Imagine having a social media team that absolutely crushes it… and then having
  a CEO who just throws all that in the trash because he can’t keep his [expletive]
  mouth shut about his trash opinions,” they wrote.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Others were quick to remind readers that this isn’t a new pitch from the tech
  world.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“This has been said by nearly every tech guy in every decade,” one user wrote.
  “They try to roll out some school based on their weird beliefs… it works for a year,
  then starts to fall apart. The students end up worse for the experience and the
  regular schools barely notice.”</p>
