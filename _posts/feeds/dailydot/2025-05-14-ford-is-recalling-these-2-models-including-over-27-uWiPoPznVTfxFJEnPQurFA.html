  <p><strong>Ford</strong> is issuing a major <strong>recall</strong> after a potential
  <strong>brake failure risk</strong> was flagged in two of its popular SUV models.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (<a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2025/RCLRPT-25V314-7594.PDF">NHTSA</a>),
  the issue could lead to a sudden loss of braking power and increase the chance of
  a crash.&nbsp;</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-which-suvs-will-be-affected"><strong>Which SUVs
  will be affected?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/recalls/">recall</a> covers 273,789
  vehicles, specifically certain 2022–2023 <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/ford/">Ford</a>
  Expedition and Lincoln Navigator models.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The problem, according to the regulatory agency, stems from the front brake lines,
  which may rub against the engine air cleaner outlet pipe and eventually get damaged.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That damage could cause brake fluid to leak, leading to reduced braking ability.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-is-ford-addressing-the-issue">How is Ford
  addressing the issue?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As detailed by the recall, Ford dealerships will fix the issue by inspecting
  and replacing the brake lines and the air cleaner outlet pipe if needed, and they''ll
  do it free of charge.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>If your vehicle is included in the recall, you’ll get a notification letter from
  Ford by May 30th, according to the NHTSA.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This latest recall comes just weeks after Ford issued a similar <a href="https://www.livenowfox.com/news/ford-recall-brake-issue-ecoboost-april-2025">separate
  recall </a>affecting over 123,000 vehicles—including 2017–2018 Ford F-150s, Expeditions,
  and Lincoln Navigators—due to brake fluid leaks from the master cylinder, which
  could lead to reduced braking performance and increased stopping distances.</p>
