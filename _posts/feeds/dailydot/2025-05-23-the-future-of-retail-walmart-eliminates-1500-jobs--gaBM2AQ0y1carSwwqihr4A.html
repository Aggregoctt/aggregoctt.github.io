  <p>In recent years, many large companies have chosen to embrace automated intelligence
  to help produce leaner, more efficient operations at the corporate level. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>For the most part, this has mostly occurred in the technology sector at companies
  like <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/microsoft-layoffs-tech-giant-trims-fat-to-feed-ai-growth-6000-jobs-gone-heres-whos-out-whos-safe/articleshow/121284158.cms?from=mdr">Microsoft</a>,
  as well as <a href="https://in.mashable.com/tech/94413/tech-layoffs-2025-from-google-to-microsoft-and-amazon-over-61000-jobs-lost-in-major-tech-companies">Google
  and Amazon</a>. A total of about 61,000 technology sector jobs have been caught
  in the crossfire of layoffs in the wake of companies adopting AI.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But it''s not just tech companies, as retail businesses have entered the chat.
  Even the company known for the smiling faces of its door greeters has fallen to
  AI use. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That''s right—the company known for literal smiley faces as part of its branding
  in the early aughts has announced it will lay off 1,500 of its employees at the
  corporate level. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Most of these positions are concentrated in the Bentonville, Arkansas, and Hoboken,
  New Jersey hubs, as reported by <em><a href="https://www.fingerlakes1.com/2025/05/22/walmart-layoffs-may-2025/#google_vignette">FingerLakes1.com</a></em>.</p>

  is Walmart laying off corporate staff?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to reporting on the issue from <em>FingerLakes</em>, the Bentonville-headquartered
  company is choosing to restructure to "sharpen focus" and embrace automation. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The cuts were described by Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner and Global Chief Technology
  Officer Suresh Kumar in a joint letter to employees as necessary for building the
  "future of retail," <em>FingerLakes</em> reports. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“We are eliminating roles as well as opening some new ones aligned with our business
  priorities and growth strategy,” the memo shared with employees reads.</p>

  other businesses embracing AI? </h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The use of automated intelligence in the retail space has become a hot-button
  issue for many retailers. Just as Walmart has made its intention to use AI in corporate
  roles public, Starbucks has elected to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/starbucks-beef-up-store-staffing-go-slow-automation-rollout-2025-04-30/">"go
  slow"</a> on its rollout of AI and focus on higher staffing.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Notably, Amazon began <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-ai-shopping-features-hear-the-highlights">using
  AI-powered audio product summaries</a> to help shoppers learn more about other customers''
  experiences. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On the customer-facing side of operations, Walmart is also reportedly preparing
  for shoppers to <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2025/walmart-prepares-future-where-ai-shops-rather-than-consumers/">use
  AI to build grocery lists</a> and potentially make purchasing decisions for them.

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-walmart">What''s next for Walmart?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As the company catches heat amid national conversations about tariffs, company
  officials have reportedly confirmed that the retailer will absorb some of the cost
  increase, as well as pass a portion of it to consumers. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Regarding layoffs, impacted employees will receive support in this transition,
  representatives of Walmart said, as reported by <em>FingerLakes</em>. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Despite the cuts, the company said it would likely be adding positions related
  to AI and "digital transformation."</p>
