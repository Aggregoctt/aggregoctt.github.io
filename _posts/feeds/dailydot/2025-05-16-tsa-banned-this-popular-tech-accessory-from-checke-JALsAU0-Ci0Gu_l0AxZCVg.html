  <p>New <strong>rules</strong> from the <strong>Transportation Safety Administration</strong>
  might make packing for your <strong>next trip</strong> just a touch more complicated.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>When it comes to charging your phone, the type of charging method might be an
  afterthought, especially when packing for a flight.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Portable chargers and power banks made with lithium batteries can feel like they''re
  easy to stow in a checked bag. After all, they are usually quite small and do not
  take up much space in a bag. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>For short flights, some folks might choose to pack their charging packs in a
  checked bag. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, a new rule <a href="https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/lithium-batteries">announced
  by the TSA in February</a> might cramp your style: lithium battery-powered portable
  chargers and power banks are no longer allowed to be packed in a checked bag. </p>

  did the TSA change the rules for power banks?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As reported by the <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/14/lifestyle/tsa-just-banned-this-popular-travel-necessity-from-checked-luggage/">New
  York Post</a></em>, lithium-ion and lithium-metal batteries must be prevented from
  short-circuiting, and cannot be stored in the cargo hold, where checked bags end
  up.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"When a carry-on bag is checked at the gate or at planeside, all spare lithium
  batteries and power banks must be removed from the bag and kept with the passenger
  in the aircraft cabin," the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/lithium-batteries">Federal
  Aviation Administration</a> advisory reads. "The battery terminals must be protected
  from short circuit."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This is because they pose a risk of overheating in the cargo hold and consequently
  exploding. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-causes-lithium-batteries-to-catch-fire">What
  causes lithium batteries to catch fire?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Lithium batteries, when overheated, can undergo a process known as thermal runaway.
  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a<a href="https://ul.org/research-updates/what-is-thermal-runaway/"> thermal
  runaway</a>, the lithium-ion battery cell experiences a reaction that causes an
  uncontrollable self-heating state. This can result in the battery exploding, ejecting
  gas and shrapnel, creating severely high temperatures as well as fire and smoke,
  which all pose a risk to other baggage stored in the cargo hold of a plane. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This can happen for several reasons, including when the battery is overheated,
  damaged, overcharged, exposed to water, or due to manufacturing defects.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-other-items-have-lithium-batteries">What
  other items have lithium batteries?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While power banks and portable chargers are the first devices that might come
  to mind, they are not the only commonly used devices that are powered by lithium
  batteries. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As reported by the <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/14/lifestyle/tsa-just-banned-this-popular-travel-necessity-from-checked-luggage/">New
  York Post</a></em>, cameras, laptops, tablets, cell phones, watches, calculators,
  e-cigarettes, and vape pens are also commonly powered by rechargeable lithium batteries.
  This means they are covered by the TSA''s ban on lithium batteries in checked baggage
  and can only be packed in carry-on bags.</p>
