  <p>Artificial intelligence is coming for your next Walmart shopping trip. The technology
  is already changing the way we <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/how-to-turn-off-gmail-ai/"

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to this <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-is-preparing-to-welcome-its-next-customer-the-ai-shopping-agent-6659ef18"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">article</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>,
  AI has already upended how users search for things on the internet. One day, the
  programs could be able to independently go on an online grocery run or find you
  the best deal on a new TV. It could even potentially check out using your payment
  credentials.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A market analyst told the<em> Wall Street Journal</em> that the shift could be
  potentially perilous for retailers who could lose their prized customer relationships
  if AI becomes a middleman in its online shopping business.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That’s probably why Walmart is working on creating its own AI shopping agents.
  The middleman can’t take your money if you own him, right? The company hopes its
  shopping gents will be able to fill out shopping lists based on simple prompts. </p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-might-walmart-s-ai-assistant-look-like">What
  might Walmart''s AI assistant look like?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Walmart''s <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/ai-shopping-google/">AI shopping
  assistant </a>would respond to prompts input by the customer. Walmart U.S. Chief
  Technology Officer Hari Vasudev gave an example of preparing for his daughter''s
  birthday party. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I want to plan a unicorn-themed party for my daughter,” Vasudev suggests as
  one prompt. The AI would then add all the potential decor and snacks needed for
  the party.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>So, if you wanted to make spaghetti for dinner, you could tell Walmart’s AI,
  and it would theoretically return with noodles and sauce. Or monitor your habits
  and buy a new bottle of ketchup just as you’re finishing up the last one.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Bots can also monitor prices and products at a much faster rate, which could
  change the way customers shop entirely.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Of course, this is all theoretical. The overwhelming amount of shopping still
  happens IRL, roughly 80%, Vasudev said, and it’ll probably take a little while for
  that to change.</p>
