  <p>In early 2021, a Toronto burger restaurant turned heads by renaming its menu
  after office supplies to (jokingly) game the tax system.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Good Fortune Burger, a fast-food restaurant in Toronto, launched a cheeky campaign
  dubbed #Receats, where classic menu items were rebranded to sound like everyday
  <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/remote-work/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">office
  purchases</a>. Their flagship Fortune Burger became the Basic Steel Stapler, while
  Parm Fries turned into the CPU Wireless Mouse. Even their double patty option didn’t
  escape the fun. It reemerged as the Ergonomic Aluminium Laptop Stand.</p>

  <p>Though it ran for a limited time, the joke resurfaced online in 2025, reigniting
  laughs and questions about where creativity ends and fraud begins.</p>

  Fortune Burger: the viral stunt blurring the line between clever and criminal</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While the menu overhaul wasn’t meant to fool actual accountants, it certainly
  drew attention. Good Fortune didn’t hide its intentions. Through food delivery platforms
  like Uber Eats, the company encouraged customers to "eat and expense."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Jon Purdy, the restaurant''s Director of Operations, stressed that the promotion
  wasn’t serious. "We just wanted an opportunity to put a smile on some people''s
  faces and have them have a little bit of a giggle," he told <em><a href="https://www.blogto.com/eat_drink/2021/02/toronto-restaurant-naming-menu-after-office-supplies-expense-meals/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">BlogTO</a></em>. Still, that didn’t stop
  people from wondering if the gimmick crossed a line.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Naturally, social media lit up. On X, formerly known as Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/brianroemmele/status/1925648371508810182"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">@BrianRoemmele</a> recently shared the
  restaurant''s old marketing campaign gimmick, and folks had a lot to say.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While some called it "lateral thinking at its best," others questioned how long
  the joke could last. One commenter pointed out, “I know we''re all having fun here
  but if you actually did this it would just be literal <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/fraud/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">fraud</a>.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I generally dislike any kind of fraud but it''s hard not to love this," one
  person tweeted.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another person said, "I''ll take a Silicone Keyboard Cover with extra silicone
  please."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/restaurant-industry" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">restaurant</a> later clarified the campaign wasn’t intended
  to promote actual fraud. "There’s no malice intended in it," said Purdy after critics
  warned of potential legal trouble. Despite the backlash, the internet largely saw
  it as clever marketing with a wink.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Their final word on the matter? A social media post, the account since deleted,
  that read, "It might be wrong. It might be crazy. But… it might just work. #Receats
  #ItMightNotTho."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Though Good Fortune Burger appears to have closed its doors since then, the legacy
  of #Receats continues to spark conversations and laughs about how far people might
  go to stick it to "the man."</p>
