  <p>A <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/homeowner/">homeowner</a> was shocked
  to discover a hidden room in her home—one year after owning it. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Homeowner Zara Braley (@zara_braley) posted a video featuring the mysterious
  space to TikTok, where it has 10.4 million views.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-behind-the-shelves">Behind the shelves</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Braley''s video starts with two bookshelves standing in front of the room in
  question. She writes in a text overlay of her video, "Discovering a hidden room
  in my house that I bought over a year ago."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"OK, so when I bought this house last year, this shelving was left. And I never
  moved it because it goes all the way to the ceiling. Last night it was discovered
  that there is in fact not just a wall, but there''s a hidden door behind the shelving,"
  Braley says. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Braley notes that it seems as if someone went through measures to seal the room,
  as it is "all taped up." </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"So the question is: Do I crack it open? Like, what if there''s, like, squirrels
  or something? Like, I don''t know," she contemplates. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While she didn''t seem too enthused about encountering rodents, she entertained
  a more positive consequence. "But also, what if there''s treasure?" she says, weighing
  the two possibilities.  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-uncovering-the-hidden-room">Uncovering the hidden
  room</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Next, Braley and her brother carefully move the shelves to get a better look
  at the room.  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Shout out to my brother who came over with a head lamp and sense of adventure,"
  she later wrote in the caption of her clip.  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She added that he arrived "to find out what was behind the door in my bedroom."
  Continuing on with the caption, she opined, "perks of having an old house you never
  know what you’ll find on a random Tuesday night."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As her brother inspects the area, he spots something. "There''s another door,"
  he says, smiling, looking back at the camera. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Another ... door? What the [expletive]?" she exclaims.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Next, the man then approaches the door and toggles on a headlamp he has strapped
  above the brim of his hat. He attempts to pull the door open twice, but to no avail.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"It''s locked on the other side, I think," he says before striking the front
  of the door with his palm. After trying the handle and bracing against his frame
  with a free hand to pry it open, it remains shut.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"What the freak?" Braley says. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"This will be above your pantry area?" he asks, before the video cuts to him
  in another portion of the house. With his headlamp still on, he peeks through another
  portion of the house, looking upwards. It appears he''s trying to assess the location
  of the hidden room and, moreover, what it could be used for.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-he-discovers-secret-stairs">He discovers secret
  stairs</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As it turns out, there''s another entry point to getting in the room. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Oh my God. It is a stairwell!" Braley says as her brother inspects the narrow
  staircase. Directly above it is another set of doors that are facing downward.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"There''s a lot of space up here, dude," her brother says as he pushes the doors
  outward. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Unfinished wood planks comprise the ceiling. The space is pretty big. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Her brother calls the space "pretty sweet" and notes that it can be converted
  into a usable space.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Big reveal," Braley says off camera. She highlights the room''s ceilings, commenting
  that she likes their aesthetic. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ghost-room">Ghost room?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a follow-up video, Braley addresses a comment from another TikToker who inquired
  about the house''s previous owners. In their remark, they ask if these former residents
  had any ghostly experiences. Judging by the #ghostgirlies hashtag on her post, it
  appears that the TikToker was asking if these prior owners witnessed any paranormal
  encounters.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the clip, Braley says that she wasn''t made aware of any such phenomena. Additionally,
  in a separate video, Braley claims that there are indeed <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zara_braley/video/7503361690155699498">"ghost
  girlies" who saunter</a> around her home as well.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As for the stairwell that leads to the attic, it appears to be synonymous with
  a staple of Victorian-era homes. Specifically, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bloomfieldfarm/video/7032266783012719878">servant''s
  staircases</a>. Oftentimes, these home fixtures were much narrower than the ones
  found in a house''s foyer or main entrance area.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Furthermore, the small stairwell that leads to the attic area is in line with
  the type of living arrangements a <a href="https://janeaustensworld.com/2011/01/29/the-servants-quarters-in-19th-century-country-houses-like-downton-abbey/">live-in
  maid would have</a>.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Throngs of commenters offered up suggestions as to what she should do with the
  area. "Turn it into a hidden library!" one exclaimed. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Viewers also praised Braley for not dragging out the reveal of the room just
  to get more views. "You''re going to heaven for putting it all in one video," they
  penned.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another person was shocked to see that Braley was more concerned with finding
  squirrels than anything else. "The way squirrels would be my very LAST concern,"
  they penned.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Others were more worried about potential safety concerns. "Please wear a mask
  up there. It was likely covered up because it wouldn''t pass an inspection potentially
  due to hazards. I''m a collateral appraiser and have seen stuff like this before,"
  one said. </p>

  <p>The Daily Dot has reached out to Braley via TikTok comment for further information.</p>
