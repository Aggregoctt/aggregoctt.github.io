  <p><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/toyota/">Toyota</a> is reviving a familiar
  nameplate—but with a completely different engine.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The Toyota C-HR, discontinued in 2022, is <a href="https://www.toyota.com/upcoming-vehicles/c-hr/">making
  a comeback</a> for the 2026 model year as a fully electric subcompact SUV aimed
  at the U.S. market.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Announced on May 14, the all-new 2026 Toyota C-HR BEV ditches its gas-powered
  past in favor of an electric powertrain, coupe-inspired design, and all-wheel drive.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Toyota says the vehicle will have a manufacturer-estimated 290-mile range, and
  it’s expected to be available sometime next year.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-else-has-changed"><strong>What else has
  changed?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to a TikTok video from car reviewer @carconfections, which has already
  racked up over 122,000 views, this new C-HR is “nothing like the old one.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>For starters, the engine is gone, replaced by a high-performance electric setup.
  He adds, “This thing goes 0 to 60 in under 5 seconds.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As for range, he says, “Toyota says 290 miles, and we’re also going to have the
  newest NACS charging infrastructure.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The creator was also impressed with the exterior updates. “I think this thing
  looks fantastic,” noting the “very stylish overall look” and “a two-tone roof.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Inside, he says, “You’re also going to have a very high-tech cabin that’s a lot
  nicer than the previous CH-R.” He pointed out the “really cool suede and SofTex
  leatherette seats,” and a “14-inch screen that’s straight out of a Lexus product.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He also boasts the practicality, saying it has 25 cubic feet of cargo space behind
  the second row of seats.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As for when you’ll be able to get one, he says it will be available sometime
  next year, estimating the price to fall somewhere between $40,000 and $45,000.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Plenty of people online are stuck on the price tag. The <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/toyota/c-hr/2022/">previous
  C-HR</a> had a starting price around $22,500, so the jump into the <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/toyota/c-hr">$40,000+
  range </a>came as a shock.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“How’d it go from 25k to 45k…” one commenter asked.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Lmaooo CHR was supposed to be an affordable class in Toyota,” another added.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“40K+ is ridiculous,” wrote a third. “This was an entry-level vehicle and now
  it’s so expensive.”</p>
