  <p>Walmart said it would <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/walmart-layoffs-price-hikes-tariffs"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">potentially raise prices</a> in response
  to the Trump administration’s new tariffs, and organized shoppers are boycotting
  in protest. Again.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The retailer was already feeling the heat after it announced <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/05/22/walmart-facing-another-round-of-boycotts-in-the-wake-of-dei-rollback-protests/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a rollback of its diversity, equity, and
  inclusion policies</a> late last year. At the time, a group in favor of DEI policies
  fought back with an organized boycott of its stores.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-walmart-boycott">A new Walmart boycott</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Now, a group called the People’s Union USA is doubling down on the action and
  calling on shoppers to avoid Walmart until May 26. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The group''s organizer, John Schwarz, said the company''s decision to raise prices
  is a sign it "doubled down on greed." The boycott includes not just Walmart proper,
  but also its pharmacy, gas stations, and in-home delivery.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>President Donald Trump is also furious at Walmart for its decision. He<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/walmart-responds-donald-trump-eat-tariffs-trade-policy-2075063"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> told the retailer publicly</a> that it
  should “eat” the cost of the tariffs and not pass the increases on to the consumer.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Walmart isn''t the only major U.S. retailer targeted by activists. Target is
  also facing a national boycott after announcing an end to its DEI programs.</p>
