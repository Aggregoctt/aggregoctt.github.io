  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>One woman''s TikTok is reigniting the debate about whether an Amazon Prime membership
  is worth the money. In a video posted on May 20, 2025, Courtney Miller (@co_mill)
  said she’s “doing fine” since she canceled her Amazon Prime membership months ago
  because her packages still are just as fast, sometimes even overnight. </p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@co_mill/video/7506304991053876511" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">video</a> has nearly 9,000 views and over 1000 comments.  </p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-amazon-prime-s-perks-worth-the-price-users-debate">Are
  Amazon Prime''s perks worth the price? Users debate</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Some commenters emphasized Miller’s message. They said that people ordering from
  Amazon will get member-speed shipping if they live in a city or close to an Amazon
  distribution center. Many discussed ethical reasons to forgo Prime membership. Others
  said they simply haven’t missed out on anything since canceling.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But reactions were mixed. People said they don’t care about fast shipping—it’s
  streaming media and credit card benefits that convince them to stay. Those living
  in rural areas where mail is slower shared they rely on Prime memberships for more
  timely deliveries. Other people said they justify using Prime membership benefits
  because they’re on their ‘mom’s account.’</p>

  <p>And plenty of people in the comments expressed that Miller’s take is common knowledge.

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She said deliveries have arrived promptly without the membership fees or extra

  <p>“In fact, sometimes you''ll order a bunch of shit, not pay extra for shipping

  <p>Miller stood in front of her latest Amazon haul—spicy ramen and a 12-pack of

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She urged Prime members to rethink their relationship with Amazon, because “you
