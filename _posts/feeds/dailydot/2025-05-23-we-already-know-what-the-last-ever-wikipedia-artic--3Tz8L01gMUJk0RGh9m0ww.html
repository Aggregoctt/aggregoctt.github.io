  <p>A theory from TikTok creator Lukas (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lukasg007/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">@lukasg007</a>) posits that Wikipedia’s
  final edit is already decided. According to him, there is a long-running prediction
  pool among Wikipedia contributors attempting to guess what the last-ever article
  on the site will be. When that article is eventually published, there is a separate
  pool for the final edit on that final article. Though it''s all in good fun, the
  theory raises questions about the future of the internet''s most valued information
  repository, and the forces that might eventually bring it to an end.</p>

  <p>"We already know what the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Last_edit_topic_pool"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">last edit Wikipedia</a> will ever get
  will be," Lukas states in the video. </p>

  <p>This "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Last_topic_pool" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia: last topic pool</a>" isn’t an official Wikimedia
  event, but it has fascinated editors and readers for years. It''s essentially a
  bet among contributors, guessing what topic will mark the end of Wikipedia’s updates.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Because of this, the article about the pool is destined to be the very last page
  changed, making it a strange, self-referential ending. It’s Wikipedia editing itself
  about Wikipedia’s own end.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While the site could theoretically continue forever, the video touches on real-world
  concerns. Lukas mentioned that Wikipedia’s future depends on many things, like its
  financing model and whether it’s even possible to "cover everything in the world
  eventually, in thousands of years."</p>

  <p>These existential questions resonated with viewers, with his <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/tiktok/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">TikTok</a> video reaching over 331.9K
  views and 31.8K likes. After all, most people take the internet’s most trusted encyclopedia
  for granted.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Moreover, Lukas encouraged his audience to check out the article about the pool,
  calling it "an interesting page read." He highlighted the speculation surrounding
  how, and why, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/wikipedia/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> might eventually stop growing.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Some suggestions on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Last_edit_topic_pool"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> include the website
  going under, interest dwindling "to the point that nobody edits it ever again,"
  the end of the world as we know it, or even simply Wikipedia changing its name,
  thus the "last article" becoming the last one under the old name.</p>

  <p>Even though no one knows exactly how Wikipedia’s story ends, this oddly poetic
  detail suggests it’s already written...or at least predicted.</p>
