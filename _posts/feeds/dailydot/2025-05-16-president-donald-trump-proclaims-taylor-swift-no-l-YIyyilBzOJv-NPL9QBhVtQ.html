  <p>The U.S. President has been beefing with the global superstar since 2018, when
  she endorsed Democrat Phil Bredesen in the Tennessee Senate race and criticized
  Republican Marsha Blackburn. At the time, <a href="https://www.aol.com/president-trump-taylor-swifts-tense-202055038.html"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Trump responded</a> to Swift''s endorsement
  by saying: I''m sure Taylor Swift doesn''t know anything about [Blackburn]. I like
  Taylor’s music about 25% less now, OK?"</p>

  <p>It is unclear why Ms. Swift is catching strays from President Trump on the morning
  of his departure from the Middle East. The singer''s Eras Tour grossed around $2
  billion in ticket sales, according to the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/arts/music/taylor-swift-eras-tour-ticket-sales.html"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">New York Times</a></em>, making it the
  highest-grossing tour in history by a long shot. </p>

  <p>More recently, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/donald-trump/" rel="noreferrer

  she was a supporter <a href="https://time.com/7214111/president-donald-trump-taylor-swift-history-super-bowl-attendance-2025/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">after questioning why</a> she endorsed
  former President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. After she endorsed former Vice
  President Kamala Harris in the 2024 race, Trump posted "I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!" <a

  the Kansas City Chiefs lost the 2025 Super Bowl to the Philadelphia Eagles, sharing
  <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113977124799338323" rel="noreferrer
