  <p>Several independent authors are facing intense backlash after readers discovered
  ChatGPT-generated responses left in their published books. Screenshots circulating
  on Bluesky and Reddit appear to show AI prompt replies embedded in final drafts
  from authors Lena McDonald, K.C. Crowne, and Rania Faris. Two of the accused authors
  responded to the allegations, according to social media posts, with one confirming
  that they used AI but only for "minor edits." It''s not going over well.</p>

  <p>Over on Reddit, users focused their ire on McDonald as they accused her of stealing
  from J Bree, bestselling author of the <em>Moral Fates</em> series. They called
  for each other to review-bomb McDonald''s <em>Darkhollow Academy</em> books, bringing
  the second in the series (the one that allegedly contains the AI response) down
  to a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/229147010-darkhollow-academy"

  <p>"I''ve recently started the practice of using AI to make very minor edits," the
