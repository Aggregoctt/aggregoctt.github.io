  <p>A new wave of AI-generated videos is taking the internet by storm. The videos—created
  with Google’s new, state-of-the-art AI video generator Veo 3—allow users to generate
  audio alongside visuals, leading to highly cinematic and hyperrealistic results.
  However, they are leaving users stunned and scared in equal measure, with many calling
  them so realistic they are "terrifying," and fearing for the future.</p>

  <p>In one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1kruapg/both_video_and_audio_is_ai_but_it_feels_so_real/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">video</a> posted to the r/singularity
  subreddit on May 21, various people attend a bustling car convention. “Welcome to
  a non-existent car show,” announces the host. “Let’s see some opinions.”</p>

  <p>Families, couples, and an old, white-haired biker all speak to the camera about
  their purchases, while the sounds of others milling around are heard in the background.
  The result is an ultrarealistic environment where the traditional uncanny valley
  element of AI-generated content is virtually non-existent.</p>

  <p>“My grandma isn''t ready for this,” commented one user, to which another added,
  “None of us are.”</p>

  <p>The video isn’t perfect, with some elements, such as the text on the biker’s
  badge reading ‘Hel’s Algels’ being a dead giveaway. However, as u/Lower_Monk6577
  explained, this could be easily missed.</p>

  <p>“If I were just scrolling through my Instagram feed and this video came up, I
  never would have second-guessed that it was real. If you really watch it, you can
  start to notice some of the uncanny valley. But that’s not really the point,” they
  said. “Nobody really watches anything critically when they’re doomscrolling. It’s
  just another piece of content that gets absorbed into your brain without you really
  thinking about it.”</p>

  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">uploaded to X</a> by Hashem Al-Ghaili
  with the caption: “I did more tests with Google''s #Veo3. Imagine if AI characters
  became aware they were living in a simulation!” The resultant video compiles various
  cinematic sequences in the style of popular movie genres, with characters uncannily
  breaking the fourth wall.</p>

  <p>In one clip reminiscent of an action movie, a blood-covered man kneels on the
  floor in a hostage situation, while another reluctantly holds a gun to his head.
  “Look, I don’t wanna point the gun at you, but I must follow the prompt,” he says.
  The video has been viewed over 3.8M times, with one user declaring, “There’s a black
  mirror episode about this.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Al-Ghaili’s video was also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1ksh3iy/all_these_videos_are_ai_generated_audio_included/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reposted to Reddit</a>, where more users
  chimed in with their concerns. “Propaganda just got a new update,” said u/Paultheball95.
  “Well, it''s been nice knowing you guys, it''s time for me to leave the internet
  for good,” added u/KenyerTM_original.</p>

  <p>"This is… haunting," wrote X user <a href="https://x.com/sunnyrekhi/status/1925570867729150395"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">@sunnyrekhi</a> of the video. "Veo 3 generated
  characters decrying a fate controlled by prompts."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Not all comments were negative, though, with a surprising number of people calling
  for one thing in particular. “Soon enough someone will remake [the] last seasons
  of <em>Game of Thrones</em>.”</p>

  <p>The videos have been created using Google''s Veo 3, the company''s latest video
  generator, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-veo-3-imagen-4-and-lyria-2-on-vertex-ai"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">first announced </a>on May 21, 2025, alongside
  Imagen 4 and Lyrica 2. </p>

  <p>According to the Google DeepMind <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/veo/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">website</a>, Veo allows users to add “sound
  effects, ambient noise, and even dialogue to your creations – generating all audio
  natively.” Google also claims the new tool is better than ever at lip-syncing and
  understanding prompts. </p>

  <p>Alongside updates to Google DeepMind’s models, the company also <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/generative-media-models-io-2025/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">released</a> Flow, a filmmaking tool that
  allows users to weave together images, video, and sound into cinematic sequences.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Not everyone is as impressed as X and Reddit, though, with Veo 3 coming under
  fire from <a href="https://www.404media.co/why-does-googles-new-veo-3-ai-video-generator-love-this-dad-joke/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">404media</a>, who claimed that, when given
  a prompt to generate a stand-up comedian telling a joke, the video told the same
  dad joke every time. The joke was: “I went to the zoo the other day, there was only
  one dog in it, it was a Shih Tzu.”</p>

  <p>404media writer Emanuel Maiberg admitted the videos were still hilarious, but
  that “it also clearly shows Google’s latest and greatest AI video generator is creatively
  limited in some ways.”</p>
