  <p>A vintage <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/coca-cola/">Coke</a> bottle
  found in a dusty <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/vintage/">antique</a> store
  turned out to be a lot more than a cool old collectible.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CocaColaCollectors/comments/15t67r8/behold_the_greatest_thing_i_have_ever_found/">post</a>
  on Reddit and a follow-up report by <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/coca-cola-1900s-collector-find-2072686">Newsweek</a>,
  one antiques lover may have stumbled across one of the oldest sealed Coca-Cola bottles
  in existence—and he only paid $75 for it.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Reddit user u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/partyjam3/">partyjam3</a>
  first spotted the pre-1916 Coke bottle two years ago while browsing at a vintage
  shop. It was marked at $100, which was out of his price range at the time. Still,
  he snapped a photo before leaving. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Fast-forward to his visit to a Coca-Cola museum. When he showed the picture to
  a museum guide, the reaction was immediate. The guide told him their oldest sealed
  bottle only dated back to the 1940s—and that his find looked even older. So, naturally,
  he rushed back to the shop.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>To his surprise, the bottle was still there. Not only that, but he was able to
  buy it for $75.</p>

  how much is it <em>actually</em> worth?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Two years after securing the item, during which he even considered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Antiques/comments/15s5ozf/the_forbidden_coca_cola_to_drinkor_not_to_drink/">drinking
  it</a>, the collector brought it to an Antiques Roadshow event for an informal appraisal.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He posted an update on <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/reddit/">Reddit</a>’s
  r/Antiques, addressing the doubters first.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Well, the appraisal person said it was most likely not resealed, so I would
  like an apology from all the people doubting me,” he wrote.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As for value? That was a little tricky.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“They had a hard time valuing it since there are no other ones ever sold,” he
  wrote. “They said $1,000 to $2,000, maybe even more.”<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/feed/"></a></p>
