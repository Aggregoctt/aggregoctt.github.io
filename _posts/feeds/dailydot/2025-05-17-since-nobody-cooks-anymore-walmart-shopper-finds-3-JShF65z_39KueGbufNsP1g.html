  <p>It looks like select Walmart locations may be quietly marking down their Blackstone
  products. Two Walmart hidden clearance deal hunters shared how they were able to
  find pricey grills for a fraction of the cost. </p>

  <p>TikToker Brian Deals (@brian.deals) stumbled upon a Blackstone 4-Burner 36-inch
  Griddle Cooking Station with Hard Cover. The grill originally cost $297, and that''s
  what it''s being advertised at in the location Brian found it in. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, when he scans the barcode on the grill''s box with his Walmart app,
  it pops up listed at $106. "Since nobody cooks anymore, Walmart is marking down
  this grill by 70% off," Brian says in his video. </p>

  <p>Another Walmart hidden clearance TikToker went looking for a Blackstone grill
  deal at her own Walmart. There, she found an even better deal. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She found a $697 Blackstone ProSeries 4-Burner 36-inch Propane Griddle with Stainless
  Steel Cabinet and Hood for only $50. That''s according to the price listed on her
  Walmart app after she scanned the box.</p>

  <p>The caveat is that only select stores have these items on "hidden clearance,"
  and the deals may vary.  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>James Rochester, CFO at CashBlog told <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-secret-ways-save-money-180053755.html">Yahoo
  Finance</a> that he recommends Walmart shoppers make sure the location they are
  shopping at in the app matches the store they are physically in before scanning.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“While headquarters orders Walmart locations to decrease a price, it is ultimately
  up to the store manager to decide how much lower to take the price. This indicates
  that clearance pricing [is] not consistent across the board,” he told Yahoo Finance.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The outlet offers some other tips for hidden clearance deal shoppers: </p>

  <ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

  <li>The home section is a good place to start. </li>

  <li>Food products that are damaged or close to their “best by" dates will likely

  <p>Like @brian.deals, @bargainkitsune also directed viewers to her Discord to see
  more hidden clearance deals. Both TikTokers have amassed large followings for sharing
  wild deals at Walmart—like a $458 <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brian.deals/video/7487963266317045035">portable
  A/C unit</a> that''s on clearance for only $1 or a $300 <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bargainkitsune/video/7498915684655648046">Hart
  toolkit</a> that''s been marked down to $10—on their respective platforms. </p>
