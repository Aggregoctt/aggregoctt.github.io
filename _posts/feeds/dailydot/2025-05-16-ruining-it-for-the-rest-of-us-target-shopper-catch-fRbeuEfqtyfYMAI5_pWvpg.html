  <p>Whether they''re flexible or stingy, <strong>return policies</strong> are controversial
  among consumers. But a common concern, especially in online discussions, is how
  customers use them. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Many have taken advantage of Costco''s incredibly lax return policy, whether
  they''re returning a <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/costco-return-5-year-old-couch/">5-year-old
  couch</a> or a <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/costco-mattress-return-5-years-later/">used
  mattress</a>. And now, one Target shopper is side-eyeing a mom who tried to take
  advantage of the retailer''s return policy by returning her daughter''s used clothes.
  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The reason? The clothes didn''t fit anymore.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Despite other shoppers'' dismay at the attempt, she may have been unfairly denied
  a return under the policy.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-denied-target-return">A denied Target return</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Mother and TikTok creator Meg (@the.mama.meg) shared her experience at Target''s
  return desk on Wednesday, where she says she was shocked by another customer''s
  attempt. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I''m just curious if other people think this is as ridiculous as I think it
  is," Meg says in the clip.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The customer tried to return a "Target shopping bag full" of Cat &amp; Jack-branded
  clothes. The reason? Her daughter outgrew them. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"The associate said, ''OK, are they damaged?''" Meg recalls. "And the lady said,
  ''No, my daughter outgrew them.''"</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The Target associate then told the customer that the return policy was "intended"
  for clothing items that were damaged. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"She said any Target brand up to a year," Meg adds. "If they''re damaged, they
  will gladly refund your money." </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Meg says the customer and the associate went back and forth for a while, with
  the customer holding Cat &amp; Jack''s alleged return policy up on her phone. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-target-accept-a-year-old-cat-amp-jack-return">Did
  Target accept a year-old Cat &amp; Jack return?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The tussle ended with the associate informing the customer that they had the
  right to refuse her return. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Meg was stunned by the customer''s behavior. "You think you can return a whole
  lot of clothes because your daughter outgrew them?" she asks. "So you''re essentially
  borrowing that amount of clothes from Target or any store. Like, what in the world?
  That is just wild to me." </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The TikToker added that the clothes were likely pretty worn, due to the simple
  fact that they were children''s clothes. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Kids play hard," she says. "You know, they''re not gonna resell the clothes.
  You just think you can borrow the clothes and get your money back." </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Meg ends the video by asking her viewers their opinions on the matter. Her clip
  has garnered over 83,700 views. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-cat-amp-jack-s-actual-return-policy">What
  is Cat &amp; Jack''s actual return policy?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This shopper isn''t the only parent trying to take advantage of Cat &amp; Jack''s
  generous return policy. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another mom <a href="https://www.sheknows.com/living/articles/2782151/target-cat-and-jack-return-policy/">successfully
  returned</a> $537.80 of Cat &amp; Jack clothes to Target in January, as SheKnows
  reported.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Target''s Cat &amp; Jack webpage says customers can return items up to one year
  after purchase with the receipt. Cat &amp; Jack is a "Target Owned Brand," and all
  of those brands developed exclusively for Target have the same returns policy. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The policy makes no mention of the item''s condition or the reason for return.
  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This appears to vary from Target''s standard return policy, which states that
  unopened items in good condition can be returned within 90 days of purchase. The
  website also states, however, that Target does reserve the right to deny returns,
  like the associate did in this customer''s case.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The Daily Dot has reached out to both Meg and to Target via email for more information.</p>
