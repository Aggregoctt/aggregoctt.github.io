  <p>Car camping offers the perfect blend of comfort and adventure. Having a car lets
  you pack everything you need into your vehicle, making this type of camping particularly
  attractive for beginners or families. But while it’s a flexible way to explore nature
  without leaving behind too many modern-day comforts, there are still some ways things
  can go wrong. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Angelica (@earthy.ang) found this out the hard way on her latest car camping
  trip. A true outdoor enthusiast, Angelica shares highlights from her camping adventures
  on TikTok. These include both the peaceful moments and the unexpected challenges
  of life on the road.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Recently, she went car camping with a friend in her Subaru, but a small mistake
  led to her draining her car battery. Angelica didn’t let that ruin her trip, though—she
  maintained a good attitude and shared the experience on TikTok instead. As she said
  in the comments, “What’s a camping trip without a lesson.”</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-subaru-s-trunk-and-battery-issue">Subaru''s trunk
  and battery issue</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the video of her TikTok post, Angelica is in the process of setting up her
  campsite. She lays a tablecloth over a collapsible table, while her sleeping bag
  and pillows are neatly laid out in the open trunk of her car. The text overlay reveals
  what happens next. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“She doesn’t know it yet, but in a couple hours her car battery will die due
  to leaving the trunk open,” she writes about her Subaru. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the caption, Angelica points out that this seems like a poor design choice
  for a car that is marketed as an adventure vehicle.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“You would think that because this is a car that’s designed to be an adventure
  car this would of been better designed by Subaru,” she says.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-viewers-weigh-in">Viewers weigh in</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Angelica’s video garnered 687,000 views, with many viewers agreeing with her
  that the car’s design flaw was a major issue.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“That such a strange oversight for a brand/model that is so heavily marketed
  towards outdoor activities. I feel like that’s something that could’ve been easily
  caught in actual utility testing,” one person said.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Several people also thanked the TikToker for her post. They admitted that they
  wouldn’t have known about the issue until they ran into it themselves.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Oh wow thank you SOOO much for sharing this! I''m a [car] person and had no
  idea. Love camping and totally would have left this open while setting up and stuff,”
  one grateful person commented.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“As someone with a Subaru, thank you for sharing! I never would’ve known,” another
  remarked.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-the-solution">What’s the solution?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>When a fellow Subaru owner mentioned an upcoming camping trip and expressed concerns
  about encountering the same issue, Angelica offered a solution that was also mentioned
  by several other viewers.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“With a carabiner…push it into the latch and it will trick the car into thinking
  the trunk [is] closed,” she wrote in the comment section of her video.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Other commenters also offered alternative workarounds and solutions for this
  issue. One person suggested Angelica get a <a href="https://halo.acgbrands.com/en_US/?srsltid=AfmBOoo2zt8ef_2kPO_PvWhDIaMoxlfIMhJ15kWA8saMZJqrHwn0AeBw">HALO
  jump starter</a>. This convenient device can not only jump-start a car. It also
  can inflate tires, charge USB- and AC-powered devices, and has a floodlight for
  emergency situations. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another suggested the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/907870253/hatch-catch-rear-lift-gate-battery-saver">Hatch
  Catch</a>. The simple 3-D printed device tricks the vehicle into thinking the rear
  door is closed. This ensures that there is no power drain even when the rear door
  is open.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to a Subaru Forrester forum, the company tried to correct the battery
  drain issue by creating a new rear door control module. The new module supposedly
  stops using battery power after 20 minutes. This feature comes standard on all models
  made after 2021.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, the problem may still persist. According to one Subaru owner on the
  forum, a company spokesperson specified that the power “never completely shuts off
  but goes into a lower power use mode after roughly 20 minutes.” In this case, it
  might be safer using a carabiner or another device like the Hatch Catch. </p>
