  <p>President Donald Trump was met with a custom mobile McDonald''s truck (branded
  in both English and Arabic) upon his first trip to Saudi Arabia since his inauguration
  in January. Trump''s love for the fast-food chain is well documented—during his
  first term, he frequently served McDonald''s at White House banquets, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/06/trump-schiller-russia-2013-244621"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ate Egg McMuffins</a> for breakfast, and
  famously worked the drive-thru <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/donald-trump-mcdonalds-staged/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">for a photo op</a> during his 2024 run.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Besides the double-staircase McDonald''s trailer, Trump was reportedly personally
  greeted at the airport in Riyadh by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) on Tuesday,
  a  gesture <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/saudi-arabia-rolls-out-custom-mobile-mcdonalds-trump-visit-2071591"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Newsweek</a> notes is "reserved for close
  allies." Both acts are presumably meant to butter up the president, who promised
  MBS $142 billion in "<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5297426-trump-saudi-investment-deal"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">state-of-the-art</a>" defense and security
  equipment after securing a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in
  the U.S.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Photos and videos of the food truck quickly spread across social media. Journalist
  <a href="https://x.com/onestpress" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Olga
  Nesterova</a> shared a video of the <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/mcdonalds/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">McDonald''s</a> truck below a caption
  reading, "Saudi Royal Court now has a mobile McDonald’s serving Trump during his
  stay." </p>
