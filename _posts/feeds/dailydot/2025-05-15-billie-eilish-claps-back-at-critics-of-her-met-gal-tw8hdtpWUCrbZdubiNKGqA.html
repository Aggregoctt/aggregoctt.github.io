  <p>Billie Eilish slammed critics of her 2025 "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style"
  Met Gala look‚Ä¶ because she wasn‚Äôt even there.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The 2025 Met Gala delivered its usual mix of jaw-dropping ensembles and dramatic
  fashion discourse. But this year, the internet went so far as to critique an AI-generated
  outfit supposedly worn by Billie Eilish, who didn‚Äôt even attend.</p>

  <p>On social media, fans quickly a striking image of Eilish in a bold blue suit,
  complete with dramatic roses stitched onto the fabric. It certainly seemed in keeping
  with the singer''s style at past Met Galas, but was unfortunately AI-generated.
  Many assumed it was legitimate, especially since Eilish has made major fashion statements
  at previous events.</p>

  <p>Eilish herself set the record straight on May 14 via her Instagram Story. The
  singer said in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/billieeilish/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">Instagram Story</a> while chomping on an ice cream cone,
  "Seeing people talk about what I wore to this year''s <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/met-gala"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Met Gala</a> being trash. I wasn''t there."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>With a disbelieving laugh, she added, "That''s AI. I had a show in Europe that
  night. Let me be! I wasn''t even there!"</p>

  was over 3,000 miles away in Europe</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Despite her history of attending the Met Gala in 2021, 2022, and 2023, Eilish
  skipped this year''s event due to her European tour schedule. While digital <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/billie-eilish/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Billie Eilish</a> strutted the AI-generated
  red carpet, real-life Billie was more than 3,000 miles away. She had back-to-back
  performances on May 4 and 5 in Amsterdam.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Unfortunately, that didn‚Äôt stop AI-generated images from fooling fans into believing
  she had appeared. Once the criticism began, it spread quickly. Some people praised
  her "bold" style choice; others labeled it a fashion fail. Either way, none of it
  was real.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Other fake images of Eilish at the 2025 Met Gala appeared as well.</p>

  <p>"Hard to drag someone for an outfit they didn‚Äôt even wear," wrote one person
  on X, formerly Twitter. "AI really got folks fighting ghosts now."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another tweeted, "It''s funny how much attention Al-genrated stuff gets. Billie.
  Keep rocking those stages. üé§üíö"</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A third commenter pointed out, "She would‚Äôve ate the theme up and then be eaten

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Interestingly, Eilish wasn‚Äôt the only celebrity to be digitally dressed up. AI-generated
  images of Katy Perry also made the rounds for the second year in a row. Perry clapped
  back with her own <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJTlSmeR9Kg/" rel="noreferrer
