  <p>In a clip of the livestream <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/15/world/video/valeria-marquez-tiktok-influencer-shot-dead-mexico-digvid">shared

  <p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexican-beauty-influencer-shot-death-during-tiktok-livestream-2025-05-14/">Reuters</a>,
  Marquez said, "They''re coming." And she quickly muted the livestream seconds before
  a man entered her salon in Zapopan, Mexico, and shot her in the chest and head.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>An unidentified person picked up her phone and ended the livestream after the
  incident.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Viewers said that earlier in her livestream, Marquez noted that someone tried
  to deliver an "expensive gift" to the salon when she wasn''t there. They said Marquez
  appeared concerned and told viewers she wouldn''t wait at the salon for the person
  to return.</p>

  did viewers react to Marquez''s death?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Viewers suggested that Marquez''s tragic death could be linked to high "femicide"
  rates in Mexico. Just days before Marquez was shot, a female mayoral candidate,
  Yesenia Lara Gutiérrez, was also shot during a campaign livestream, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/12/americas/mexico-mayoral-candidate-shot-dead-broadcast-intl-latam">CNN
  reported</a>.</p>

  <p>Femicide is the killing of women because of their gender. Cases frequently involve
  domestic violence, sexual abuse, or gender-based degradation, Reuters reports. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to the <a href="https://www.cepal.org/en/pressreleases/least-11-women-are-victims-femicide-every-day-latin-america-and-caribbean">United
  Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean</a>, Mexico has
  one of the highest rates of femicide on the continent. Across Latin America, 11
  women are believed to be victims of femicide daily. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Reuters reported that Mexican authorities also suspect that the shooting may
  be a femicide. </p>

  <p>"Another femicide. Women aren’t safe, and some imply we don’t need feminism anymore,"
