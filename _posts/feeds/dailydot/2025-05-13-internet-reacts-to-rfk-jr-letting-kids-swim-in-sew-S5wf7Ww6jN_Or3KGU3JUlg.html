  <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is catching flak for taking his young grandchildren into
  a creek known for its infestation of bacteria and pathogens.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On May 11, the Secretary of Health and Human Services reminded us why his appointment
  was so controversial with a post celebrating Mother’s Day.</p>

  <p>"Mother’s Day hike in Dumbarton Oaks Park with Amaryllis, Bobby, Kick, and Jackson,
  and a swim with my grandchildren, Bobcat and Cassius in Rock Creek," he wrote on
  X.</p>

  RFK Jr.''s Rock Creek outing is problematic</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>What was intended by RFK Jr. to be a cute little display of family fun was actually
  concerning to those familiar with Rock Creek.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The added Community Note on the post directs to the National Park Service <a
  href="https://www.nps.gov/rocr/planyourvisit/stay-dry-stay-safe.htm" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">website</a>, which explicitly states that "swimming and
  wading are not allowed" in Rock Creek "due to high bacteria levels." It also warns
  against infectious pathogens and the dangers presented to wildlife in the area if
  humans "scrambling in and out of the creek" erode the banks.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/13/rfk-jr-swim-rock-creek-washington-dc"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, swimming has
  been banned in the creek since 1971 due to how contaminated it is with everything
  from feces to hepatitis to viruses. This is largely because of how the creek is
  hit with runoff from sewage systems when it rains, a result of an archaic design.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Commenters also noted that there are <a href="https://x.com/SatireAP/status/1921940906493522403"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">literally signs</a> around the area warning
  people to stay away, but apparently RFK Jr. couldn’t be bothered with something
  as frivolous as rules or science.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-s-the-health-expertise">Where''s the health
  expertise?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Although his critics were not at all surprised that a man obsessed with health
  while seemingly understanding so little about it would bring kids to a toxic creek
  for a little splash, they still reamed him out on social media in response.</p>
