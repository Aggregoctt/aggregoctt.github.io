  <p>In the past, experts have spoken out about the potential harm TikTok can have
  on young people, and now, it looks like TikTok is finally listening. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The app''s solution to this problem, which was announced in a blog post, is to
  break up the FYPs of users under 18 with a <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/meditation/">meditation</a>
  exercise.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tiktok-s-10pm-meditation-announcement">TikTok''s
  10pm meditation announcement</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This feature, which is known as "Meditation in Sleep Hours," will be available
  to all users, but only those under eighteen will have the feature turned on by default.
  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to TikTok''s <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-expanding-mental-health-education-fund-and-wellbeing-features">official
  announcement</a>, if the first meditation prompt is ignored, a second, full-screen
  "harder to dismiss" prompt will be displayed.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>TikTok also claims that the feature is already proving to be a success, with
  98% of teens choosing to keep the meditation pop-up on. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, this doesn''t necessarily mean that they participated in the meditation.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-it-works">How it works</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Adults wishing to turn on the feature need to visit the "Screen Time" settings
  page and turn on "Sleep Hours."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a video explaining the new feature, child psychologist <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drwilloughjenkins">Dr.
  Willough Jenkins</a> explains, "I want to remind you that your brain needs sleep
  to function at night. When you sleep, you process emotions, you store memories...
  You even clear out waste." </p>

  title="@drwilloughjenkins">@drwilloughjenkins</a> Sleep is one of the most powerful
  tools we have for mental health, especially for teens. But winding down isn’t always
  easy. That’s why I’m loving TikTok’s new Meditation in Sleep Hours feature. It helps
  teens and adults step away from the scroll and into a calmer night with guided meditations,
  soft music, and reminders when it’s time to rest. To turn it on: Go to Settings
  and Privacy &gt; Screen Time &gt; Sleep Hours Set your bedtime, and let the app
  help you unwind. Let’s build better sleep habits, together. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tiktokpartner?refer=embed"

  <p>"It''s like a little nighttime rinse cycle for your brain, but when you''re stuck
  in scroll mode, that doesn''t happen," she continues.</p>

  <p>This isn''t the only change <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/tiktok">TikTok</a>
  has made to promote the well-being of its younger users. Back in March, TikTok introduced
  app limits and parental monitoring tools for teens. This comes amid an ongoing lawsuit
  that claims TikTok is purposely advertising an "addictive algorithm" to young people.</p>

  <p><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">In the blog post, TikTok also announced
