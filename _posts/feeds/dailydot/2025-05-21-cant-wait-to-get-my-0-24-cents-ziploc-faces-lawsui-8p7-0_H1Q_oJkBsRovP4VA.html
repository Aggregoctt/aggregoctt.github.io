  <p>A California resident <a href="https://www.aboutlawsuits.com/wp-content/uploads/20250425_CheslowComplaint.pdf">filed
  a lawsuit</a> against plastic bag brand Ziploc, claiming that the container could
  be leaching harmful microplastics into food items.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Microplastics are small plastic fragments that form as plastic degrades. They
  cause health concerns such as hormone disruption, cancer, and immune system problems,
  per a study in <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9920460/">Nutrients</a>.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Despite the growing concern regarding microplastic exposure, further research
  is needed to determine a definitive link between <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/microplastics-in-body/">microplastics
  and health problems</a>.</p>

  Ziploc bags contaminate food with microplastics?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The lawsuit pointed to specific claims by Ziploc that the bags are microwave-
  and freezer-safe. However, research suggests that heating or freezing plastics could
  release microplastics into the food items within the bag.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Studies found that <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10917744/">plastics
  degrade</a> faster when heated, potentially releasing microplastics faster.</p>

  <p>According to <a href="https://ziploc.com/en-us/products/bags/freezer/large">S.C.
  Johnson &amp; Son, Inc</a>., the maker of Ziploc, its bags are free from two common
  microplastic culprits, BPA and phthalates. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, the company didn''t disclose the material used in its <a href="https://one5c.com/plastic-pollution-136931518/">plastic</a>
  bags.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The lawsuit claimed that Ziploc bags are made with polyethylene and polypropylene,
