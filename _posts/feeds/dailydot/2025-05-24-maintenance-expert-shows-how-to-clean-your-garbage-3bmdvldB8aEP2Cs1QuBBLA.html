  <p>A Jacksonville, Florida-based apartment complex maintenance technician shared
  a simple way to clean your garbage disposal using just two household items you probably
  already have on hand. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The tip was posted by Indigo Isles (@indigoislesjax) on May 14 and already has
  66,000 views. The video stars a maintenance technician named Jayson. According to
  <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@indigoislesjax/video/7504736268144725278">a playful
  post</a> by the complex, Jayson "does it all" for the complex‚Äîfrom the landscaping
  and cleaning the pool to installing and maintaining the community gym equipment.

  <p>In the most viral video on the apartment''s account, Jayson shares his "little
  maintenance tip."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He grabs a few blocks of ice from an ice cube tray and sticks them in the garbage
  disposal. He then runs some hot water over them while sticking a few more cubes
  down the drain. Jayson then pours Mrs. Meyer''s Liquid Dish Soap in the disposal
  as the hot water continues to run. "Put a little dish soap‚Äînot too much," Jayson
  warns. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While the hot water runs, Jayson turns on the disposal. Not only does this leave
  you with a "nice, clean" disposal, according to Jayson, but it also "prevents fruit
  flies and ... sharpens your blades."</p>

  <p>Viewers thanked Jayson for the tip and begged for more content like this. "Aye

  <p>How to clean and unclog drains in the bathroom is a common request in the comments
  section. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Can you do one for unclogging bathroom drains?" one asked. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I need tips for my bathtub drain and bathroom sink they‚Äôre both clogged," another
  said. </p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Apartment Therapy <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/tiktok-garbage-disposal-ice-cleaning-trick-36871965">spoke
  with</a> a plumbing expert while reporting on a similar hack. Paul Abrams, a representative
  from Roto-Rooter Services, told the outlet that this method is actually one he recommends.
  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, he prefers not letting the water run until after the ice cubes are finished
  pulverizing. This will reportedly ensure the ice cubes unlodge all of the debris
  in the disposal first. Then the water sends it to the sewer afterward. When hot
  water is used in tandem with the ice, there is a chance the debris will come back
  up into the sink. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Here are some alternative cleaning agents you can mix with ice if you don''t
  have dish soap on hand: </p>
