  <p>As the biggest YouTuber in the business, Jimmy "MrBeast" Donaldson has his fingers
  in a lot of pies. One such pie is (ironically) in the food business, with the creator
  making a name for himself with products like the Beast Burger, Lunchly, and Feastables.
  One of Donaldson''s newest products is his Peanut Butter Cups, which were announced
  back in March.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Given Hershey is best known for its Reese''s Peanut Butter Cups, there was always
  going to be a little bit of tension between MrBeast and Hershey. However, Donaldson
  took things one step further after publicly calling out the brand on X.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the post, he shared two pictures. One was of his Feastables Peanut Butter
  Cups in its regular cyan and orange packaging. The other? Reese''s Butter Cups,
  which appeared to switch up its usual orange and yellow combo with a color scheme
  identical to Feastables. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"When I search Feastables on Target, I get this Hershey ad that conveniently
  uses our Feastables blue color," Donaldson wrote in the accompanying post. "Stop
  harassing my fans, Hershey, they don''t want you."</p>

  <p>At the time of writing, the post has amassed 1.2 million views. </p>

  <p>In response to the post, opinions were mixed. Some showered Donaldson with praise,
  with one X user <a href="https://x.com/HabibiCapital_/status/1924882670917447982">writing</a>,
  "Thank you for focusing on ethical sourcing of chocolate still with a delicious
  taste and affordable price. U a real one fr."</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another <a href="https://x.com/DirectedbyAlexg/status/1924881218446983168">added</a>,
  "I bought a huge pack at Sam’s Club yesterday, way better than Hershey''s."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But others were more critical of the millionaire.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Bro thinks he owns light blue," one X user <a href="https://x.com/VerneBurn69/status/1924923536730214892">said</a>
  in a post. "They use light blue all the time. During easter, their kiss tags, and
  their cookies and cream bars. Also this is very common practice in advertising.
  We get tired of seeing your face like you get tired of seeing their brand too lil
  bro."</p>

  <p>Elsewhere, a further user <a href="https://x.com/BradleyAlsup/status/1924898376220307684">asked</a>,
  "Didn’t you send Feastable trucks with ads through Hershey Pennsylvania? Or did
  I dream this? They’re just playing the game you set for them Jimmy."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Indeed, back in April, Donaldson sent three giant vans advertising Feastables
  directly to Pennsylvania headquarters. So, is this color switch-up Hershey''s getting
  even? Or is it really just a coincidence? Either way, the war between Beast and
  Hershey''s is far from over. </p>
