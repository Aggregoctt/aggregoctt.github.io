  <p><strong><strong>Update 2:27pm CT, May 14:</strong>¬†</strong>In an email to the
  Daily Dot, an Airbnb spokesperson wrote,<strong> </strong>‚ÄúWe support our guests
  in the rare event that something isn‚Äôt as it should be with a stay. We‚Äôve issued
  a full refund to this guest and are supporting them with rebooking, and are conducting
  a further review of the host''s account.‚Äù Tanya also tweeted an update, <a href="https://x.com/Tanya_Sabrinaaa/status/1922716512650928277"

  <p>An Airbnb guest took to social media after her host told her that hot water is
  an optional amenity. Tanya (<a href="https://x.com/Tanya_Sabrinaaa" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">@Tanya_Sabrinaaa</a>) <a href="https://x.com/Tanya_Sabrinaaa/status/1922311425281687832"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">posted screenshots</a> of the interaction
  on X, formerly known as Twitter. She said, "New entry in @Airbnb being an absolute
  scam."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The Airbnb host told Tanya that there was "a temporary issue with the hot water
  at the property you booked." They added that it was being actively worked on and
  hoped to have the issue resolved quickly. Overall, the message was professional
  and courteous.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Tanya asked if she would be refunded for her stay if it wasn''t resolved before
  her booking date. The Airbnb host responded that they were "unable to offer refunds
  in this situation as hot water was not listed as an included amenity at the time
  of your booking."&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Hot water is typically considered a given unless stated otherwise. Tanya pointed
  this out in her response to the Airbnb host. She wrote, "So you are choosing to
  potentially rip me off because you didn''t list an assumed amenity. You also didn''t
  list windows and doors, if those are missing i guess that''s fine too!"</p>

  an optional amenity?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to another experience similar to Tanya''s, yes, it is. In 2023, a <a
  href="https://abc7news.com/airbnb-host-utilities-customer-service/12833196/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">group of friends</a> went on a ski cabin trip in Tahoe,
  CA. Unfortunately, they ran out of hot water during their stay. When they reached
  out to the host and Airbnb customer service, they discovered that because hot water
  wasn''t a listed amenity, the host wasn''t obligated to provide it.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a <a href="https://abc7news.com/airbnb-host-utilities-customer-service/12833196/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">statement to <em>ABC 7 News</em></a> about
  the 2023 incident, Airbnb said, "We do allow hosts to self-select hot water as an
  amenity, however, this is meant to be used for remote, off-the-grid listings so
  that guests can plan properly. For this particular case, our team did follow up
  with the host to inquire about any amenity issues that may need to be addressed."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>There are many other documented cases of Airbnb guests discovering that hot water
  wasn''t a bare minimum expected amenity. In a post on the <a href="https://community.withairbnb.com/t5/Help/Refund-denied-because-the-hot-water-is-not-included-to-the/m-p/1148835"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Airbnb Community Center forum</a>, a guest
  asked if they had any recourse for needing to book a hotel in Geneva after discovering
  they had no hot water. While some people told them to escalate to a case manager,
  the resounding answer was that unless it''s listed, you shouldn''t expect an <a
  href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/airbnb/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>
  to have it.</p>
