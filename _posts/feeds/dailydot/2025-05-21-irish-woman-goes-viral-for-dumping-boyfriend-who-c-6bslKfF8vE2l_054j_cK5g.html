  <p>A young Irish woman went viral on Reddit’s r/AmIOverreacting after sharing that
  she broke up with her English boyfriend because he called her a "terrorist." In
  her post, which has over 35,000 upvotes and 10,000 comments, 18-year-old u/PhilosophyOwn2169
  described a tense moment at an Irish pub where a patriotic song prompted her 21-year-old
  boyfriend to storm out. She took to the subreddit to ask whether she was overreacting
  for breaking up with him, and commenters replied with a near-unanimous verdict:
  No.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While OP and her English boyfriend were visiting Ireland, a popular Irish song
  with references to anti-RA (Republican Army) sentiments played as they danced at
  the pub with friends. u/PhilosophyOwn2169’s English boyfriend became uncomfortable
  when she and many other Irish people on the dance floor chanted along with the song.
  The boyfriend stormed out of the pub—after calling her a terrorist. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>People responded to u/PhilosophyOwn2169’s query with thoughtful responses unpacking
  political issues, history, and feelings about Irish-English relations. Others just
  found it absurdly funny that a man could refer to his girlfriend as “a terrorist.”
  Most commenters weighing in deemed the breakup, NOR—not overreacting.</p>
