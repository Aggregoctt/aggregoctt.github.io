  <p>A couple urged other homebuyers to seek additional inspections after discovering
  two major issues in their "dream home," just days after moving in.</p>

  <p>In <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@haileyyy_annn/video/7500359853722979630">a
  video</a> with over 2 million views, TikToker Hailey Ann (@haileyyy_annn) walks
  into a room in her new house, zooming in on a termite hive to the left of a window.</p>

  <p>"POV: You closed on your house three days ago," on-screen text reads. In the
  caption, she clarifies that the home received a termite inspection before closing
  on the house.</p>

  <p>The TikToker <a href="https://people.com/couples-new-home-turns-into-horror-story-72-hours-after-closing-exclusive-11731476">told
  <em>People</em></a> that the buying process was "smooth." and prior inspections
  didn''t find any issues with the home. However, on their way to close on the house,
  she said their realtor told her that they discovered termites.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She said the sellers claimed they handled the termites the same day they were
  discovered. But just a few days after moving in, she said she discovered the termites
  in the exact location the realtor said they were before.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Just hours after pest control came to deal with the termites again, Hailey Ann
  said a pipe burst, soaking their floors. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She told <em>People</em> that the events after move-in made her question their
  decision to purchase the home. "Honestly, I’ve been struggling a lot with just feeling
  like we made the right decision, or feeling like this is the right home for us,"
  she said. </p>

  the couple have advice for homebuyers?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Have a really good real estate agent, because our agent has been an advocate
  for us," she told <em>People</em>. "If we didn’t have someone that we trusted and
  knew what they were doing, I think we would have to be paying for this out of pocket.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the comments of the TikTok, viewers shared their own experiences with home-buying.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Always always hire two inspectors from two different areas !!! As a home buyer
  twice trust they always find something different from one another that one missed
  !!!!" one wrote. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I just backed out of house because of termites, mold and raccoon damage in attic,"
  another said. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Read your agreement. if you just signed it, you have days to get out of it,"
  a third suggested.</p>
