  <p>A San Francisco-based TikToker, who posts under the handle cafeconpostre (@cafeconpostre),
  uploaded a video of all the comped food she received after an issue arose at a hotel
  she was staying at.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the video, Queenie explains an incident where someone who worked at the hotel
  unexpectedly came into her room while she was naked. The woman was caught completely
  off guard. And the intrusion led to the hotel offering her compensation for the
  mishap. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She does not go into great detail about what the hotel took care of but suggests
  that the decadent meal in front of her was one of the comps she received. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The TikToker shows off a table laden with steak, broccolini, and mashed potatoes.
  Then she films herself and another, older woman, presumably her mother, as they
  enjoy the food.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the text overlay, the TikToker writes, “Someone walked in on me [naked] in
  my room &amp; they comped us like crazy.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The video from cafeconpostre received 315,000 views. A surprising number of viewers
  said they could relate, sharing that they’d experienced similar situations themselves.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“This happened to me while i was FAKE TANNING in my room before a rehearsal dinner,”
  said one person.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“I walked in on someone once…. I have never been more mortified. But hey we both
  got comped,” another said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“My husband and I got stuck in the hotel elevator for 2 hours, they comped our
  stay and the next day we ordered room service breakfast, comped as well. It was
  the most beautiful breakfast I’d ever seen,” someone else recalled.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A few people pointed out that while accidents happen, how a hotel responds speaks
  volumes about their level of customer service.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“That’s good customer service. Hope y''all left a good reviews. [Stuff] happens
  but it’s all about how they react to it that shows a place''s integrity,” said one
  commenter. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Cheaper than a lawsuit," remarked another. </p>

  <p>It can be unsettling if a hotel staff member accidentally enters your room while
  you’re inside. But there are steps a guest can take to protect their privacy and
  ensure the issue is addressed.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Try to remain calm if this happens. The staff will usually realize their mistake
  and leave right away, but if they do not, ask them to do so. Once they are out of
  the room, secure the door using the deadbolt.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Document the incident as best you can. Note the time when it happened, along
  with any identifying details about the employee. Then, immediately report the incident
  to hotel management by either calling the front desk or going down in person if
  you feel safe to do so.</p>

  <p>Most reputable hotels will take such an incident seriously and will work to immediately
  rectify the situation. This may be accomplished with an apology and an explanation
  of why the mistake happened to begin with. Depending on how serious the incident
  was—like if the guest was in a compromising position, say naked, for example—it
  would be reasonable to ask for compensation like a discount or a room upgrade.</p>
