  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In today''s episode of dystopian capitalism, a <strong>FedEx worker</strong>
  thought she was having a <strong>heart attack</strong> during her shift, but was
  scared she''d get <strong>fired</strong> for going to the hospital.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>No one should have to choose between their <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/health/">health</a>
  and <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/labor/">their job</a>, but it''s a decision
  many Americans make daily.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Some people can''t afford to take time off because they don''t have paid sick
  days, others are pressured to come into work despite symptoms, and others lose their
  health insurance when they <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/fired/">lose their
  job</a>.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>It''s not just an unfair system—it''s dangerous.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fedex-worker-has-a-medical-emergency-on-the-clock">FedEx
  worker has a medical emergency on the clock</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a viral video with more than 800,000 views, FedEx worker Kals (@mxs.kali)
  shared the potential life-or-death decision she had to make in the middle of a delivery
  shift.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"As my manager says, ''Doctors notes don''t deliver packages,''" Kals recalls.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"However, nor does dead people," Kals points out.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">In the video, Kals shows that her Apple
  Watch is aglow, showing her heart rate is at 154 beats per minute, which is on the <a
  href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/target-heart-rates"
  target="_blank">higher end of a normal rate</a> for a person in her age group.</span></p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Kals said that all day it felt like someone was in her chest squeezing her heart,
  and when she breathed in, she got a sensation up her neck and down her shoulder.
  She ruled out dehydration since she''d been drinking water all day and hadn''t been
  out in the heat much.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On top of that, her fingers were tingling and she felt dizzy. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>And while she didn''t want to jump to the conclusion that she was having a heart
  attack at 22 years old, that''s what the symptoms looked like to her, especially
  since it felt nothing like the panic attacks she''s previously experienced. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I''m freakign the [expletive] out," Kals said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-34-more-stops">34 more stops</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>With tears in her eyes, Kals said she "only" had 34 more stops left and was going
  to try to make it to the end of her shift so she could finally go to the emergency
  room.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I''m suffering because I don''t want to get fired. I really think I''m having
  [expletive] medical emergency right now," Kals said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Maybe I''ll just die for FedEx," Kals said. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In an Instagram direct message, Kals shared that whenever she''s had to call
  out, which isn''t often, her manager was "very passive-aggressive." It always seemed
  like her boss was going to fire her, she said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"When i called and let him know about my symptoms, he just said, ''You''re fine
  drink some water,''" she shared. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-she-make-it-to-the-hospital">Did she make
  it to the hospital?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">She ended up making it to the end of
  her shift and was treated in an emergency room, but was just given an aspirin, and
  her symptoms were dismissed as an anxiety attack and dehydration, she&nbsp;<a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/target-heart-rates"
  target="_blank">shared in a follow-up</a>.</span></p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, most of Kals'' symptoms didn''t go away, and she still felt dizzy and
  tingly. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"They gave me no answers," Kals said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-pots">What is POTS?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Kals ended up going to a primary care doctor the next day, who diagnosed her
  with POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome). It''s a condition that affects
  blood flow and the nervous system and impacts heart rate and blood pressure.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>When people with POTS move from lying down to standing, they can have a drop
  in blood pressure and experience many of the symptoms Kals did, plus fainting, brain
  fog, heart palpitations, and fatigue, <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16560-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-pots#:~:text=Postural%20orthostatic%20tachycardia%20syndrome%20(POTS)%20is%20a%20condition%20that%20causes,manage%20the%20symptoms%20of%20POTS.">according
  to the Cleveland Clinic</a>. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>It''s often misdiagnosed and more commonly affects women.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-warnings-abound">Warnings abound</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I work in cardiology. those are CLASSIC signs of a cardiac event, and you need
  to go to the ER NOW," a top comment read.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"As a ER nurse, please call 911," a person said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Don’t be driving like this. you’re putting yourself at risk and putting other
  drivers and families at risk. Not worth it get medical help. Not to mention if something
  does happen this video will be used against you. Just saying," another pointed out.</p>
