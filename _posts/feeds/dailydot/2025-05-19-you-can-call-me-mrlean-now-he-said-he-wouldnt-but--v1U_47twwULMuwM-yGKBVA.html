  <p>After weeks of fan requests, YouTube megastar MrBeast gave in and recreated the
  viral "Hood MrBeast" meme.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Jimmy "MrBeast" Donaldson uploaded an edit of himself decked out in streetwear,
  flashing wads of cash, exactly like the viral <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/memes/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">meme </a>that has been circulating on
  TikTok. Interestingly, he opened the video by saying, "I’m not doing the hood MrBeast
  trend, stop asking," before cutting to a dramatic reveal of himself fully in character.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, he posted a series of stylized images in the same Hood MrBeast
  meme theme to Instagram. In his caption, he added, "You guys can stop asking me
  to recreate the meme now 😭" The post quickly racked up likes and shares, adding
  even more fuel to the already viral trend. Fans of the content creator had clearly
  been waiting for this moment, and <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/mrbeast/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">MrBeast </a>knew exactly how to deliver.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Before going full "Hood MrBeast," the YouTuber dropped subtle hints that he was
  aware of the trend. In a prior post, MrBeast tagged fellow content creator IShowSpeed
  in a meme-style image where their faces were swapped. While the image was bizarre,
  the real twist came from IShowSpeed’s confusion. He even commented on the unexpected
  tag during a stream, which led fans to believe MrBeast had something bigger planned.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Because of these breadcrumbs, some fans suspected the meme recreation was inevitable.
  His recent post confirmed their suspicions.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-internet-reacts-to-hood-mrbeast">The internet
  reacts to Hood MrBeast</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As expected, the internet blew up with commentary after MrBeast finally embraced
  the meme. His Instagram post has over 6 million likes and 75.8K comments. On TikTok,
  fans flooded the comment section with laughter and celebration. One user wrote,
  "HE ACTUALLY DID IT AHHHHHH 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻" Another TikToker said, "idk what i was expecting
  but it wasn’t this LMAO"</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Other people who commented on the video talked about how they always knew that
  MrBeast was attractive, and this clinched it for them.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Over on X, formerly known as Twitter, however, folks were less impressed by MrBeast''s
  Mr Lean Meme look and weren''t afraid to share their opinions about his take on
  the meme.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"They cloned that mf thank God 🙏somebody had to stop him from turning the world
  into a squid game," wrote <a href="https://x.com/2lakil/status/1924221193705468380">@2lakil</a>.</p>

  <p>Another person unimpressed by MrBeast''s meme look tweeted, "Why does it look
  like he has to practice smiling."</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Many people online also compared his Hood MrBeast look to Tony Stark or Doctor
  Strange from the Marvel movies.</p>
