  <p>A Baltimore woman just hit the jackpot, winning a $200,000 prize from a Ravens
  X10 scratch-off ticket. However, she says it wasn’t just luck, it involved research
  and her specific lottery technique.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The retired adult-day care provider, who goes by the alias Blazing Bay, is no
  stranger to the <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/lottery/">lottery</a> world.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She plays scratch-off tickets twice a week and told <a href="https://www.mdlottery.com/homework-is-key-to-200000-ravens-x10-scratch-off-win/">Maryland
  Lottery </a>officials that she’s “had lots of luck with scratch-off tickets.”&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Even with her frequent wins, however, one goal remained. “As grateful as I am
  for $500 wins, I’ve always dreamed about finding a really big winner,” she said.</p>

  her big lottery winning strategy?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Blazing Bay says her technique involves tracking the Maryland Lottery website
  to look for scratch-off games that still have big prizes available.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She spotted that the Ravens X10 ticket still had a $200,000 top prize in play—and
  decided to go for it.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She picked up a ticket from a gas station in <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/baltimore/">Baltimore</a>
  and started scratching.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“I think I stopped breathing when I finished scratching,” the woman recalled.
  “There were matches all over the place.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Alone in the convenience store, she let herself celebrate with a small dance.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“I was so excited about winning that I didn’t even add up all the prizes.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Eventually, she realized just how big her win was. “I needed to take a deep breath
  to start sending out prayers of thanks.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The woman didn’t say what she’ll do with the money, but told officials it “couldn’t
  have come at a better time.”</p>
