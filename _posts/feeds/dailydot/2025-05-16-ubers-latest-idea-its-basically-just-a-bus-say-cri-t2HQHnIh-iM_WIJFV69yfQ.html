  <p>Uber’s latest shuttle service innovation sounds a lot like a rebranded bus system,
  and people online have taken notice.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On May 14, 2025, Uber unveiled Route Share, a new shuttle service that is designed
  to ease the weekday commute. The feature offers fixed-route rides that run every
  20 minutes "along direct routes during morning and evening commute hours" in major
  cities, like NYC and Chicago, according to the <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/route-share/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>. Each vehicle seats
  up to three riders and costs about half the price of an UberX.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/uber/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Uber
  </a>marketed the service as a breakthrough for everyday commuters. However, many
  observers on social media couldn’t help but point out the similarities to a very
  old idea: the public bus.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That being said, the Route Share model doesn’t exactly mirror the standard public
  bus model. It is more expensive than one swipe on the MTA, but also more private,
  with only a couple of other people in the shuttle at a time.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"It’s the perfect way to get to and from work without breaking the bank," the
  company said in a <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/go-get-2025/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>. CEO <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/05/16/uber-route-share-feature-mocked-by-customers-invented-the-bus/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Dara Khosrowshahi added</a> that the feature
  was built with affordability in mind. "The goal for us as we build our products
  is to put people at the center of everything, and right now for us it means making
  things a little easier, a little more predictable, and, above all, just a little
  more—or a lot more—affordable."</p>

  <p>Social media took off, mocking Uber for reinventing the wheel after the Route
  Share announcement.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Uber just invented… the bus," tech founder Marc Seitz quipped in a viral video
  post.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Former healthtech CEO Andy O’Donoghue echoed the sentiment. He wrote on X, formerly
  Twitter, "Uber announced a new type of ride that travels along a set route, comes
  every 20 minutes, includes up to two other passengers, and costs up to 50 percent
  less than an UberX ride. In other words, a bus."</p>

  <p>Others responded more critically. "Saying Uber ''invented'' the bus is as stupid
  as saying FedEx and UPS invented the post office," one commenter noted.</p>

  <p>While the jokes rolled in, others saw a more serious context behind Uber’s move.
  Public transit agencies across the U.S. have been struggling. In cities like Boston,
  fixed-route shuttle services have been shut down due to budget cuts or lack of demand.</p>

  <p>"I can''t believe we live in a society where the mere act of a private company

  <p>Indeed, some users didn’t view Uber’s move as innovation. They saw it as a reaction
