  <p>This is not a false alarm. <strong>Costco</strong> now allows its members to
  use the installment payment app <strong>Affirm</strong> when checking out on its
  website.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Affirm is one of several <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/mortgage-lender-warns-against-afterpay-klarna/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">loan payment apps</a> steadily <a href="https://www.statista.com/insights/consumer/brand-profiles/3/12/affirm/united-states/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">gaining popularity</a> among U.S. consumers.
  The company markets itself as allowing consumers to “<a href="https://www.affirm.com/how-it-works"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">pay on their own terms</a>” by splitting
  a $500-$1,000 purchase into four installments. Shoppers select their terms at checkout,
  and the entire transaction should be interest-free, as long as they pay as agreed.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-costco-s-big-payment-change">Costco''s big payment
  change</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This news might shock some loyal Costco shoppers, because the brand is known
  for a slow-but-steady approach to adding new technologies to its stores.</p>

  <p>According to <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/retail/costco-quietly-makes-payment-change-members-will-love"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The Street</a>, you’ll now be able to
  add $500 worth of items to your Costco.com cart and choose Affirm as your method
  of payment during checkout. You’ll have to fill out a short form and pick a payment
  plan. Remember that the penalties for not following through on your agreement are
  steep. You’ll go from interest-free to anywhere between 10% to 36% overnight.</p>

  <p>But what wouldn’t you do for two of these <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/retail/costco-solves-key-problem-for-parents-"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">inflatable mega water slides</a>? Paid
  off right in time for the holiday season.&nbsp;Depending on how the installment
  plan worked out, parents can potentially be in line to secure another Affirm loan
  to pay off Christmas gifts.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This is one of several changes Costco made recently, including increased gas
  rewards, a new warehouse tool in the app, and increased promotion of its Costco
  Next marketplace.</p>
