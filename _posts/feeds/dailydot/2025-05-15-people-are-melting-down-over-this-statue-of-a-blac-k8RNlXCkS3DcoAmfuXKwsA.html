  <p>Why is a 12-foot statue of a Black woman in Times Square <a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/times-square-statue-thomas-j-price-statue-debate-1234741944/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">angering people</a> on the internet? You
  get three guesses…</p>

  <p>Thomas J Price is a London-based sculptor who is known for both stop-motion animation
  and contemporary bronze sculptures. One of his latest works is <a href="https://www.timessquarenyc.org/tsq-arts-projects/grounded-in-the-stars"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Grounded in the Stars</a>, a 12-foot figurative
  bronze sculpture of a Black woman that is currently on display at Broadway and 46th
  Street in New York City.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The installation started on April 29 and will last until the middle of June.
  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Price aimed to disrupt the traditional ideas around who should be the subject
  of sculpture by depicting a young woman in everyday clothing in a stance reminiscent
  of Michelangelo’s David.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Of course, leave it to social media to take an uplifting message and drag it
  through the mud.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The art work is the subject of vile rants on X, with some even calling it a sign
  of the “death of civilization.” </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>And it’s not just on X. The hateful commentary is on Instagram, too, with one
  white influencer asking sarcastically why the woman deserved recognition.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>And it’s not just on social media. </p>
