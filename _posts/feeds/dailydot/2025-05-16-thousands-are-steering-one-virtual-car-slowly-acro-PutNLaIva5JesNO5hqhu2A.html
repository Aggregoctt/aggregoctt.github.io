  <p>What happens when a thousand people try to steer one car? You get Internet Roadtrip,
  a virtual joyride slowly creeping across America on Google Street View, powered
  entirely by <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/viral/" rel="noreferrer noopener"
  target="_blank">collective chaos</a>.</p>

  <p>Every nine seconds, the site tallies votes from all online participants to decide
  which direction to turn, whether to honk the horn, and what radio station to play.
  Then, the car inches forward a few more feet. A red line on the map marks its meandering
  path, which so far has stretched from Boston to the coast of Maine. At the time
  of writing, they''re heading to Sears Island, Maine.</p>

  the backseat drivers fight over turns.</p>

  plays roadtrip: A crowdsourced joyride through Google Street View</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Neal Agarwal, the developer behind the project, <a href="https://www.404media.co/900-people-are-collectively-driving-an-internet-roadtrip-on-google-street-view/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">told <em>404 Media</em></a> that the idea
  had been on his mind for a while. "I’ve had the idea of ‘Twitch plays self-driving
  car’ for a long time, but that’s probably not street legal, so this is the next
  best thing."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He cited Twitch Plays Pokémon and Reddit’s /r/Place as inspirations. "I think
  communal experiences on the internet are so fun, especially when there’s some shared
  goal," Agarwal added.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Although the car is fictional, the Street View imagery is very real. Users get
  to experience small-town America together, like arguing over detours to towns with
  funny names or "bothering" pedestrians. Someone even convinced the group to pass
  through Woonsocket, Rhode Island, purely for the funny name.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-radio-stations-and-random-detours">Radio stations
  and random detours</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As the car creeps forward at roughly 3 miles per hour, the soundtrack constantly
  changes. The radio pulls from actual streams local to the car’s location. One morning,
  users bailed on Deana Carter’s "Strawberry Wine" and voted to switch to a Maine
  college station playing David Bowie instead.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Chatter from the <a href="https://discord.gg/ZBTWx54Z" rel="noreferrer noopener"
  target="_blank">official Discord server</a> fuels the experience. A side panel on
  the website streams conversations in real time, making it feel like everyone is
  stuffed into the same digital backseat. "We got to see water!!" one person said,
  while others complained about not being let onto Sears Island.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"The internet road trip car has a radio that gets like 5 local stations, wrote

  the car has gotten really into WBOR, a college station in maine. (we''re still in
  maine. we''re going to be in maine for days) they''ve decided to take the car to
  the station but in order to make sure they arrive during the day while the djs are
  on air, they''re killing time by driving around backroads on islands."</p>

  <p>Occasionally, the car even honks when the chat agrees to spam the "honk" command
  enough times. As the backseat drivers left Sears Island behind, they agreed to honk
  goodbye.</p>

  <p>Despite its glacial pace, the <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/community/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">community</a> behind Internet Roadtrip
  is determined. They''re plotting ways to cross the Canadian border and dreaming
  of hitting all 50 states. One user even created a 30-hour timelapse of the car’s
  progress so far.</p>

  <p>A major moment came when a participant called into WMUAx 91.1 FM in Massachusetts
  while the car passed through the area. "This is so cool," one of the DJs said on
  air.</p>

  <p>At this rate, reaching Canada may take a week, or even longer. But with thousands
  of digital passengers sharing the ride, no one seems to mind the detours.</p>
