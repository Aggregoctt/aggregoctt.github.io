  <p>Tens of thousands of Audi vehicles in the United States are <a href="https://unionrayo.com/en/volkswagen-audi-recall-oil-leaks-engine/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">being recalled</a> by parent company Volkswagen
  due to a defect that could make engine fires more likely.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Announced in May, the recall includes more than 89,000 Audi Q5 Quattro and Audi
  Q5 Sportback Quattro due to a mechanical issue that causes oil leaks. Basically,
  the assembly line might’ve improperly installed part of the engine.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-years-are-part-of-the-recall">What years
  are part of the recall?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>If your Audi is a 2022, 2023, or 2024, this is relevant to you. That’s because,
  of course, an oil leak in a car engine can potentially lead to a fire.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>If you’re not sure whether your vehicle is impacted, you can visit the National
  Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">recall page</a>. Its search engine allows you to search
  for safety recalls by VIN or year, make, and model.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>No way to sugar coat it: If your vehicle is included in this recall, it’s bad
  news. However, consumers can at least be reassured that they will get to take their
  vehicle into an Audi dealer to be replaced. That process is expected to start later
  this summer.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Of course, German car brands like Volkswagen and Audi are <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/bmw-audi-volkswagen-mercedes-expensive-to-maintain/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">notoriously expensive</a> and difficult
  to maintain. For instance, a brand-new 2025 Audi Q5 will at least run you $52,000.
  A Reddit mechanic once said German cars are “ridiculously designed” and rarely intuitive
  to service.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“I dislike German cars,” they wrote. “Not because they’re difficult but because
  they’re just so ridiculously designed. They think they’re genius for doing the dumbest
  [expletive]. Some stuff is cool and intuitive but rarely.”</p>
