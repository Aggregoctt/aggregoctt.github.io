  <p>When one man checked his Spotify Wrapped, he didn‚Äôt expect it to unravel his
  entire relationship.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Redditor u/serenologic <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1kn7j3v/i_found_out_my_girlfriend_was_cheating_on_me/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">shared a post</a> in r/confessions titled,
  "I found out my girlfriend was <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/cheating/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">cheating</a> on me through her Spotify
  Wrapped‚Ä¶ and now I can‚Äôt even listen to music anymore." What began as a quirky tradition
  between a couple of sharing their annual Spotify Wrapped turned into a digital trail
  of heartbreak.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Although the event happened back in December, the emotional sting still lingers.
  He wrote, "It still messes with me every time I hear certain songs." The couple
  had lived together and regularly shared music, making their Spotify Wrapped feel
  like a reflection of their <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/relationships/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">relationship</a>. But when last year''s
  Wrapped came out, something felt wrong.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He wrote, "Our top artist was someone I‚Äôd never heard of." The mystery musician
  had fewer than 500 monthly listeners and made raw, emotional indie music, which
  was completely outside their usual shared taste.</p>

  the musician led to a painful realization</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Curious, the Redditor investigated further. "Turns out: local artist. lives in
  our city. follows her on ig. She follows him back," he explained. That alone raised
  suspicions, but what came next confirmed his fears.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>After scrolling through the artist‚Äôs Instagram highlights, he spotted his girlfriend
  in them. The truth was unavoidable: "She had been playing his songs constantly at
  his place‚Ä¶ while I thought she was working late."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He confronted her. At first, she lied. Then she admitted to the affair but downplayed
  it, saying, "It wasn‚Äôt serious." Despite her excuse, the relationship ended a week
  later.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Though he never told her how he found out, the damage was done. What once was
  their favorite app became a constant reminder of the betrayal. "Now I can‚Äôt use
  Spotify without feeling like an idiot," he confessed. "F**k Spotify Wrapped."&nbsp;</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/reddit/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a>
  users flooded the post with support and disbelief. Many expressed heartbreak on
  his behalf. Others were shocked by how something as harmless as Spotify could become
  a betrayal detector.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Several users related to the idea of music being forever tainted by a relationship.&nbsp;</p>

  <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Reddit comment that reads, &quot;It''s
  crazy how that works. I had an ex that it was very similar. Not Spotify though.
  I knew when her music tastes changed to something random that we never, ever listened
  to (not even the same style) that something was amiss. I was right about that.&quot;"

  <p>"Why are you mad at Spotify, it was being your bro! It had your back! If it weren''t

  <p>The OP replied, "True that. Spotify did me dirty, but also saved me from living
