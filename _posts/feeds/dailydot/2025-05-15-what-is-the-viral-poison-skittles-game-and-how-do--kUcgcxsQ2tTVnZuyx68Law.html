  <p>Leave a pair of children alone long enough, and fairly soon you''ll find they
  have created a new game to play. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On TikTok, where digital games like <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.internetmatters.org/hub/news-blogs/what-tiktok-roblox-and-googles-updates-mean-for-childrens-online-safety/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiUsvyolKONAxUVRfEDHX7qL1AQxfQBKAB6BAgQEAE&amp;usg=AOvVaw1kMELgZZx2crBmhMPKA7aI">Roblox</a>
  and Fortnite have gained huge popularity among young children, a new physical game
  is taking over. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The one catch: you need some type of small candy to play the game. Skittles are
  just the most popular option among content creators. Called the "poison Skittles
  game," the new pastime has taken TikTok by storm.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-poison-skittle-game">What is the
  Poison Skittle game?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The simple game requires just two things: luck and small candy. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The "poison" Skittle game, as reported by <em><a href="https://www.indy100.com/tiktok/one-is-poison-game-tiktok-trend-explained">Indy
  100</a>,</em> involves two people playing a game where one person decides a particular
  candy in a batch is the supposed "poison."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This singular candy is laid out with a small group of candies, like a handful
  of Skittles, by one player while the other has their back turned. The two players
  then take turns eating the candies, carefully avoiding the "poisoned" one. With
  each safe candy eaten, each player earns a hypothetical $100,000.</p>

  <p>Despite the name and often <a href="https://eu.seacoastonline.com/story/news/local/2025/05/14/hampton-exeter-nh-schools-sound-alarm-over-dangerous-tiktok-chromebook-challenge/83606131007/"

  that are given life on TikTok, the poison Skittle game does not actually involve
  poison.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The "poisoned" candy is simply one that both players aim to avoid eating, as
  they work through a pile of candies like Skittles, chocolate eggs, gumdrops and
  other sweets—really, whatever candy left over from the Easter holiday around the
  house will likely work for this game.</p>

  <p>One of them ultimately chose the "poison" pink candy at the end of several rounds
  of choosing candies that were safe to eat. </p>
