  <p>It seems Target is in its flop era.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>From cutting diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts to careless design choices,
  the brand just isn''t hitting like it used to.</p>

  this?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a wildly viral video with over 27 million views, content creator Rachel (@rachel8500)
  shared the weird thing she noticed about an item she just got from Target.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"How did Target approve this design?!" Rachel asked in the text overlay.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Rachel picked up a butter dish designed to look like a baguette. "Cute!" she
  probably thought while she added it to her cart.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But when she went to use it, the standard-size butter stick just ended up sandwiched
  between the two parts of the dish, both too long and too wide to fit in the contraption.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The item is listed as a <a href="https://www.target.com/p/baguette-ceramic-butter-dish-bullseye-39-s-playground-8482/-/A-93566482">Baguette
  Ceramic Butter Dish </a>and retails for $5, however, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/376256358633?chn=ps&amp;norover=1&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-117182-37290-0&amp;mkcid=2&amp;mkscid=101&amp;itemid=376256358633&amp;targetid=882300791467&amp;device=c&amp;mktype=pla&amp;googleloc=9004362&amp;poi=&amp;campaignid=1669934603&amp;mkgroupid=65058347419&amp;rlsatarget=pla-882300791467&amp;abcId=1123856&amp;merchantid=548690360&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=1669934603&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD_QDh_D8Xi2Zs22eyhll8NYO5Iw0&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwravBBhBjEiwAIr30VATkEwHt_B0yeJ5BnuJdB65Y73-r1i-ftDyIYcSDXZOllaovkp3h9xoCBeEQAvD_BwE">resellers
  are charging upwards of $15 </a>for the sold-out item.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The butter dish currently has a two-star rating, which suggests that others bought
  the kitchenware item and were disappointed when they tried to use it for its butter-holding
  purpose.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-a-butter-dish">What is a butter dish?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While many people store butter in the fridge to keep it fresh (it is a dairy
  product after all), others prefer to leave it out so it can remain soft for spreading
  on foods like toast.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Salted butter can be left out for several days as its less prone to spoilage
  than unsalted butter, U.S. Dairy <a href="https://www.usdairy.com/news-articles/does-butter-need-to-be-refrigerated">notes</a>.</p>

  <p>Target, once a long-standing corporate leader in diversity, equity, and inclusion,
  ended its commitments to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion earlier this
  year,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/target-ending-diversity-goals-dei-trump/">CBS
  News reported</a>.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>People have been boycotting for the last few months in response, and it''s making
  an impact.</p>

  target="_blank">The Street reported that foot traffic (which can lead to more sales)

  to employ</span>ees acknowledging it''s been "a tough few months."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>When the rollback was first announced, Target stated they would no longer work
  toward hiring more women and members of racial minority groups, end a program established
  to help Black employees build impactful careers, and no longer actively recruit
  diverse suppliers and businesses.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In recent communications, Cornell reiterated the company‚Äôs commitment to ‚Äúinclusivity,

  would take moving forward, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2025/05/08/target-ceo-tries-to-inspire-confidence-in-memo-to-staff-but-it-may-backfire/">Forbes
