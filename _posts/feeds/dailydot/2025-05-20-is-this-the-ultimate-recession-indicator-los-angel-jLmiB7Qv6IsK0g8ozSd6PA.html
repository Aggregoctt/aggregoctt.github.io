  <p>Los Angeles Apparel‚Äîfounded by former <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/american-apparel/">American
  Apparel</a> CEO Dov Charney‚Äîis <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJsoWAppbN3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=">about
  to open</a> its first-ever New York City store.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The new location is set for 480 Broadway in SoHo, right between Broome and Grand
  Streets, taking over the space that once belonged to Topshop.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The brand has only operated <a href="https://losangelesapparel.net/?srsltid=AfmBOorlrM5qxTWrksVzHDbZ8jByuZ436RNxZUJdWy5HPQbzVu3LMPPW">online</a>
  and out of its Los Angeles factory warehouse until now, making this a major shift.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>And while the store isn‚Äôt open yet‚Äîit‚Äôs set to launch this summer, customers
  already have a lot to say about it.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-some-shoppers-are-already-feeling-nostalgic"><strong>Some
  shoppers are already feeling nostalgic</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/tiktok/">TikTok</a> user @sarahfromnewyork
  shared her thoughts about the news in a recent video that‚Äôs now pulled in over 59,900
  views.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>‚ÄúIs this the ultimate recession indicator?‚Äù she asks at the start of the video</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She then went on to explain how impactful American Apparel once was to her own
  teenage years.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>‚ÄúA huge informative part of my adolescence was stopping by American Apparel on
  my way home from school,‚Äù she shares. ‚ÄúI went to middle school in Chelsea, and their
  7th Avenue location was so sick.‚Äù</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Of course, she didn‚Äôt forget the popular ad campaigns.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>‚ÄúAmerican Apparel‚Äôs ad campaigns from the 2010s were entirely formative for so
  many of us,‚Äù she says. One campaign in particular?</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>‚ÄúThe 2011 footwear campaign rewired my brain chemistry and nearly put me in a
  coma when I first saw it,‚Äù she says, stitching a photo of the campaign in the background
  of her video.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>To her, shopping in person brings back a very specific feel. ‚ÄúIt just makes me
  think of Arctic Monkeys and LCD Soundsystem and HBO Girls era in New York,‚Äù she
  shares.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She concludes the video by clarifying a key distinction for viewers: While this
  is Los Angeles Apparel and not American Apparel, the connection between the two
  brands is significant.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>‚ÄúGranted, this is LA Apparel, not American Apparel,‚Äù she states. ‚ÄúBut you know,
  I‚Äôm personally very excited for this store opening.</p>
