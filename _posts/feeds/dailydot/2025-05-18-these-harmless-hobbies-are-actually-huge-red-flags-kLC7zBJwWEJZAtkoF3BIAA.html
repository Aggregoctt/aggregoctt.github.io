  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">asked fellow Redditors</a>, "What is a
  hobby that''s an instant red flag?" The community responded with a mix of humor
  and genuine concern. The thread quickly filled with anecdotes highlighting activities
  that, while some were seemingly innocuous, might hint at deeper issues. </p>

  <p>Examples included child beauty pageants and scrolling on social media. Others
  were more obvious, like finding enjoyment in hurting animals, "pranks" that were
  really bullying, and petty crimes.</p>

  <p>In today''s digital age, social media habits can be telling. One Redditor shared,
  "I had an ex who got mad at me for not having ''interesting hobbies'' and when I
  finally asked her what her hobbies were, this was it. Same girl also got mad at
  me because I had nothing in common with her friends so it was hard to make a good
  conversation with them. Finally one day I asked her what she even talked to them
  about... her answer ''we talk about funny TikTok''s.''"</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Others complained about how some people need everything to be "picture perfect"
  for social media posts. These people, they say, throw fits if you try to eat before
  they get the chance to document everything, curated for Instagram.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While sharing moments online is common, some Redditors highlighted the red flag
  of oversharing. One person described a partner who posted every detail of their
  relationship, turning private moments into public content. Another mentioned breaking
  up with someone who was more engaged with their phone than with real-life interactions.</p>

  <p>Another hobby that <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/reddit/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">Redditors </a>marked as a red flag was some people''s
  obsession with celebrities'' lives.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Redditor u/NarwhalTakeover wrote, "I used to be this. It was weird. It was unhealthy.
  It was escapism and fantasy. I’m glad that I am not like this anymore."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Someone politely asked them how they developed the hobby. They explained that
  it came from "finding comfort and stability in a fantasy."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This obsessive behavior can also be attributed to a number of other topics, including
  fictional characters and serial killers.</p>

  <p>Gambling was another hobby that raised alarms. One user shared that their ex
  lost everything due to gambling. They noted that gambling isn''t just a hobby; it''s
  a house wrecker and a person breaker.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another Redditor shared a story of going on a first date with a woman. While
  he was chatting with the restaurant staff, she was caught red-handed stealing from
  another woman''s purse.</p>

  <p>Another Redditor included debating politics as an annoying red flag hobby they''ve

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Debating/arguing politics. Like to the point where they steer literally every
