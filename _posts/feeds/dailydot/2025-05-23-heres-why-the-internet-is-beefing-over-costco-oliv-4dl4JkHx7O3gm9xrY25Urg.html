  <p>A Reddit post about a bottle of Costco olive oil has morphed into a full-blown
  internet flame war. After one self-proclaimed olive oil expert dismissed "most"
  Costco olive oils as "trash," a debate that began on the r/oliveoil subreddit jumped
  to X, where users questioned his credentials and rallied behind their favorite brands.
  "Extra Virgin Guy" has since gone viral, defending his palate and even considering
  building an olive oil recommendation app to settle the matter once and for all.</p>

  <p>The drama began eight months ago, on Sept. 25, 2024. <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/reddit/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a> user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oliveoil/comments/1fpa7f9/thoughtsfeedback_on_this_brand_new_to_my_costco/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">u/benjiTRAVEL</a> posted a photo of Terra
  Delyssa olive oil at a local Costco and asked for thoughts from the denizens of
  the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oliveoil" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">r/oliveoil</a>
  sub.</p>

  <p>As is often the case on Reddit, opinions were mixed. A couple of the top responders
  claimed it has low polyphenol content, making it bland. Others, however, found it
  to be worth a venture into the vast realms of <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/costco/"

  So Quality and purity are first rate, you don’t end in Costco by accident, they
  have a pretty stringent process to even be considered. As for the taste, these things
  are highly subjective by the types of olives and the longer growing season (Tunisia
  is just below Italy but is in Africa) so the olives stay on the trees longer and
  the resulting flavor profile is considered smooth or smoother than an Italian brand
  which my have that peppery bite. I preach value a lot on these threads and here
  you are getting an organic EVOO for a vey good price. You should enjoy it.&quot;"

  <p>With his credibility solidified, users on both Reddit and X flocked to ask Grunberg
  for his personal olive oil recommendations. While he did shout out a couple brands
  such as Gaia Oliva and Olive Truck, coming up with an answer without any information
  presents a challenge.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a <a href="https://extravirginguy.beehiiv.com/p/extravirginguy-went-viral-559d"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Beehiiv post</a>, Grunberg outlined his
  idea for an olive oil recommendation app. The extra virgin expert seems reluctant
  to do this himself because there are so many factors around what kind of oil is
  right for each individual.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I think I received 15-20 people asking for an oil recommendation today. I guess

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Based on how people organized this list, the app would then produce a list of

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As of May 19, 2025, when he published the post, he wasn''t sure whether he wanted

  or he found a decent way to monetize it.</p>
