  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Wholesale stores like Costco and Sam’s Club allow shoppers to get a discount
  on items by both buying in bulk and paying a membership fee.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>People on the internet are, in general, pretty big fans of this business model.
  Social media is filled with stories of people sharing their Sam’s Club and Costco
  stories, from shoppers recounting <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/costco-dryer-530-dollars/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">positive experiences</a> to others sharing
  tips on <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/sams-club-rotisserie-chicken-hack/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">how to find the freshest items</a> in
  the store.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, not every experience shared on social media about these stores is a
  positive one. For example, a TikTok user says that she was charged over $100 after
  using her friend’s Sam’s Club card.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-did-this-sam-s-club-shopper-end-up-with-a-110-fee"><strong>How
  did this Sam’s Club shopper end up with a $110 fee?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a video with over 558 thousand views, TikTok user Amanda (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@keepingupwithamandaj">@keepingupwithamandaj</a>)
  issues a warning to all viewers with Sam’s Club accounts.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“If you did not know it, they automatically auto renew your account now,” Amanda
  says.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Not only that, but Amanda claims that, rather than the “Club” membership that
  costs $50 per year, Sam’s Club’s auto-renewal automatically subscribes shoppers
  to the “Plus” membership, which costs <a href="https://www.samsclub.com/join" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">$110 annually</a>.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>After being charged a $110 renewal fee, she went to Sam’s Club to try to get
  the renewal refunded, as she only buys the $50 Club membership.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Upon discussing the issue with a worker, she was informed that the renewal was
  not actually for her account, but for a friend’s account.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-issues-using-a-friend-s-card">Issues using a
  friend''s card</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>To summarize, Amanda had gone shopping at Sam’s Club with a friend but forgot
  her card. Her friend then let her use her Sam’s Club card. This saves Amanda’s card
  to her friend’s account, and thus, makes it the card that would charge for the auto-renewal.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@keepingupwithamandaj/video/7498953233453321502"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">follow-up video</a>, Amanda clarifies
  that her friend can’t resolve the situation by paying her the money directly, as
  her friend also says she did not consent to the more expensive membership, only
  the $50/year “Club” membership.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“I''m so freaking pissed, and now, they cannot reimburse me until she comes up
  here, which is inconvenient because it''s on her account, and she has to pay for
  her renewal before they can refund my card, some freaking [expletive],” she concludes.
  “So check your damn accounts because if you didn''t know it, they are auto renewing
  without even asking.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-this-common"><strong>Is this common?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Amanda isn’t the only internet user to complain about Sam’s Club''s auto-renewal.
  On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsclub/">r/SamsClub</a> subreddit, there
  are numerous posts from users complaining about the company’s auto-renewal policy.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Some state that they turn off auto-renew, only to have their membership <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsclub/comments/1dow8v4/comment/lnqgora/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">automatically renew anyway</a>. Others
  claimed they removed cards from their account, then <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsclub/comments/1dow8v4/sams_club_auto_renew/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sam’s Club still charged them</a>. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Regarding Amanda’s specific claim that both she and her friend were bumped up
  to, and charged for, a Plus membership, this does not appear to be a widespread
  issue. We have reached out to Sam’s Club via the Walmart Media Relations contact
  form for additional information.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In response to this, many advised simply turning off auto-renewal. However, as
  Amanda learned, this is often more difficult than expected, as users have reported
  that they needed to either physically go into a store or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsclub/comments/1bghj73/cant_turn_off_membership_auto_renew_online/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">call the company</a> in order to cancel
  the auto-renewal.</p>
