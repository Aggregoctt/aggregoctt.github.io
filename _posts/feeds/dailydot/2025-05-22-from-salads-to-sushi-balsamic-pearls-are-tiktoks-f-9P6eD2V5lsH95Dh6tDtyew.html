  title="@platingqueen">@platingqueen</a> Replying to @BelleMillerWill BALSAMIC PEARLS
  RECIPE ⬇️ Save this for your next dinner party— your guests won’t believe you made
  them yourself!! • Whisk about 1 cup of balsamic vinegar with 1 tablespoon of agar
  powder— eyeballing it is fine • Bring the mixture to a simmer to activate the agar
  • Let it simmer for 1–2 minutes, then remove from the heat Here’s where most people
  mess up: it’s all about the temp. Too hot and it’ll explode out of your squeeze
  bottle. Too cold and it sets into jelly! • Let it cool for 2–4 minutes until it’s
  warm and pourable, but not starting to set • Funnel into a squeeze bottle • Fill
  a glass with ice-cold vegetable oil— 30 minutes in the freezer is perfect • Drop
  it in slowly, one drop at a time, in a circular motion (from a little height!) •
  Strain over a bowl to save the oil, then rinse the pearls under running water •
  Serve with caprese, cheese, or whatever your heart desires ✨ ——— <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foodstyling?refer=embed"

  <p>Viewers drooled over this recipe as the video went viral, and commenters had
  a lot more ideas on the topic. TikTok user @chronic_thickness says that you can
  use cold vegetable oil and a squeeze bottle to make pearls out of more than just
  balsamic vinegar.</p>
