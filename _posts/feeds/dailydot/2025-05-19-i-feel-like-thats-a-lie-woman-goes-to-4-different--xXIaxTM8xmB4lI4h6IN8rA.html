  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Everyone knows that the price one sees at a dealership isn’t always the price
  that they’re going to end up paying.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That’s why the internet is filled with advice about how to properly negotiate
  a car purchase, from revealing which <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/never-answer-3-car-dealership-questions/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">questions you should avoid answering</a>
  to customers discussing the <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/wildest-car-dealership-negotiations/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">unhinged ways</a> they’ve gotten their
  car price down.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But is that really the case? As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/business/trump-auto-parts-tariffs.html"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">car prices rise</a> due to President Trump’s
  tariff plan, some dealerships are saying that they have little wiggle room with
  car prices. This has led to awkward experiences like the one recently had by TikTok
  user Sadie (@s.s.training).</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-wouldn-t-these-dealerships-let-her-negotiate"><strong>Why
  wouldn’t these dealerships let her negotiate?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a video with over 304,000 views, Sadie asks whether it’s “true that car salesmen
  are not allowed to negotiate on the prices of cars anymore.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Because I went to four different car dealerships and all of them said they''re
  not allowed to negotiate,” she continues. “And I feel like that''s a lie. I feel
  like I, maybe, am just getting scammed because they looked at me and saw that I''m
  like a 20-something-year-old girl.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As the video continues, she claims that the dealerships told her that “now, everything
  is listed at, like, the lowest they can go, because everyone can compare to the
  prices online.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While Sadie says this explanation “seemed kind of believable,” she claims she
  still doesn’t believe it, even though “none of them were willing to budge on the
  prices at all. Literally at all.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“This has to be a lie, right?” she concludes.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-were-these-dealerships-lying"><strong>Were these
  dealerships lying?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Sadie was likely right in her assessment of the dealerships. In general, <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/negotiating-101.html"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">most dealerships</a> will let you negotiate
  prices, and <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/how-to-negotiate-without-going-to-dealership/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">experts advise</a> getting multiple offers
  from different dealerships to use as leverage in negotiations.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That said, there are some instances in which a dealership will not accept negotiations.
  For example, some dealerships <a href="https://money.com/haggling-car-dealership-is-disappearing/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">advertise</a> “no-haggle” pricing, though
  they are generally clear about this prior to a customer inquiring about a vehicle.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Additionally, supply chain issues mean that inventory is relatively limited for
  some makes and models of cars. Consequently, some dealerships may not feel the need
  to offer discounts, as they believe it remains likely that they will be able to
  sell the vehicle for the advertised price.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>If one finds themselves in Sadie’s position, they can contact more dealerships
  and compare prices, then use those prices in negotiations.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-if-they-couldn-t-negotiate-then-what-s-their-purpose"><strong>‘If
  they couldn’t negotiate then what’s their purpose?’</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the comments section, many users echoed Sadie’s disbelief, with several questioning
  what the purpose of a car salesman would be if negotiation were off the table.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“What’s the point of a salesman then lol,” wrote a user.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“If it’s taxable, then it’s negotiable,” stated another.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“I went to Ford literally last week- I was able to bring a new car down by 5,000,”
  offered a third. “I say they are lying.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That said, some claimed that the dealerships may have been honest.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“As a female salesperson, can confirm we cannot. Car values are at a standstill,
  there’s not very much room for markup. We literally have to compete with the market.
  We watch other car dealers and always make sure we’re cheaper,” declared a TikToker.
  “Why are car dealerships the only place people feel entitled to ‘negotiate?’ I don’t
  go to the grocery store to do that lol. It’s not the 60s anymore.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“As a 20 yr old women salesperson, my dealerships corporate policy is either
  clear cut pricing for new cars and one priced pre owned for used cars,” explained
  a second. “It’s a thing, and I don’t agree with it but a lot of dealerships are
  going that route!”</p>
