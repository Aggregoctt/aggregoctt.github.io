  <p>Amazon is issuing long-anticipated refunds for some customers. According to <a
  href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/05/21/amazon-refunds-purchases/83776603007/"><em>USA
  Today</em></a>, some customers who had issues with Amazon returns in the past may
  finally get closure.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Per reports, one customer has been waiting for their refund since 2018.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The company offered up details on the move to <em>USA Today</em>.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Following a recent internal review, we identified a very small subset of returns
  where we issued a refund without the payment completing, or where we could not verify
  that the correct item had been sent back to us so no refund was issued," Amazon
  spokesperson Maxine Tagay said in a statement to the newspaper.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Apparently, customers do not need to take any additional steps to get their refunds.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"There is no action required from customers to receive the refunds, and we have
  fixed the payment issue and made process changes to more promptly contact customers
  about unresolved returns going forward," the statement explained.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-many-customers-will-receive-a-refund">How
  many customers will receive a refund?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>It is still unclear how many customers will expect to get funds credited back
  to them.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, first-quarter earnings calls back on May 1 offered some potential insights.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On that call, the company''s CFO, Brian Olsavsky, reported the company took a
  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-20/amazon-gives-refunds-apologizes-for-years-old-returns-issues?embedded-checkout=true">$1.1
  billion </a>hit in a one-time charge. The money was used for "historical customer
  returns" that were unresolved and also plans to stockpile inventory ahead of any
  tariffs.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amazon-customer-reported-1-800-refund">Amazon
  customer reported $1,800 refund</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>An Amazon customer, Steven Pope, allegedly received nearly $2,000 from a refund
  issued by the company.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"WILD - Amazon just refunded me finally for a return in 2018!" he posted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7330386633764102146/">on
  Linkedin</a> on May 20 for a TV set he had purchased in 2018, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/671407/amazon-returns-refunds-old-orders">the
  Verge reported</a>. "$1,798.81 is being credited to me today in 2025 after 7 years."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Amazon returns have also been making other news headlines. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/class-action-lawsuit-accuses-amazon-of-failed-refunds-who-could-qualify/3749019/">potential
  class-action suit alleges</a> several customers were recharged for an item even
  after they returned it.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to Amazon''s policy, the retailer can reverse a refund if an item is
  not returned or is returned in bad condition.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On April 29, a Seattle federal judge denied Amazon''s motion to dismiss the case.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Discovery is ongoing.</p>
