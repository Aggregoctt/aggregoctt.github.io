  <p>An emoji takeover is sweeping YouTube. After content creator John Casterline
  urged his 7.2 million subscribers to start using the <strong>aerial tramway emoji</strong>
  🚡, allegedly the "least-used emoji in the world," comment sections across the platform
  have been flooded with the little yellow icon.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The campaign, which Casterline described as an effort to “make history,” quickly
  went viral, leaving many out of the loop and those in the know proudly declaring
  allegiance to “tram gang.” </p>

  <p>Casterline captioned <a href="https://youtube.com/embed/b_N6dh7rbDQ?si=UKDeg1W1Aprp3aUS"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">his original video</a> “LET''S MAKE HISTORY.”
  In it, he explained his bold plan to viewers. “This is the least-used emoji in the
  world,” he claimed, as he showed the emoji—a suspended aerial tram which can appear
  either red or yellow depending on the site—on screen, alongside its irl counterpart.
  “We’re gonna change that, and I need your help.”</p>

  <p>“And if someone doesn’t know why you’re doing it, don’t tell them,” he clarified
  to over 6.1M viewers.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Commenters were immediately onboard with the campaign. @BubblesVR said “TRAM
  GANG FOREVER! 🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡”, to 1K likes, while @TheCoolStyle commented, “THIS WAS ABSOLUTE
  CINEMA 🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡.”</p>

  <p>The internet caught on quickly, and within 24 hours, John <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/b_N6dh7rbDQ"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">returned to YouTube</a> to thank his audience
  for popularizing the movement.</p>

  <p>“A ton of creators have reached out to me telling me that their comments sections
  are full of these emojis,” he said. The creator posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lQ_z-ZVAP-U"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">further update</a> on May 18, 2025, where
  he speculated that bots were now using the tram in their comments, after picking
  it up from human users during training. He also screenshotted a Russian TikTok,
  which he asked someone to translate in the comments.</p>

  <p>“The russian tiktok says, Americans now have a replacement for the laughing emoji
  which is the aerial tramway” one user explained.</p>

  <p>“Our leader, we won''t falter 🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡🚡” someone else added in praise of
  the tram— a comment which amassed an incredible 22K likes.</p>

  <p>Not everyone was in on the joke, though, with one poster consulting the r/OutofTheLoop
  subreddit to ask about the trend. “What''s going on with 🚡 emoji on a lot of yt
  shorts?” they queried, linking to another, unrelated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Jz81Zs-Lk9w?si=XCVqmm2SlcK5EoJG"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Short</a> by a tech creator that was littered
  with aerial tram emojis in the comments.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While some users forwarded OP to John’s video, some also speculated on why the
  emoji was unpopular in the first place, with user Dagur suggesting this was because
  there were only “8 suspended rails like this in the world.” Others provided deeper
  context on the origins of the movement, which, as it turns out, dates <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-least-popular-emoji-is-the-aerial-tramway/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">back to as early as 2018</a>.</p>

  <p>“Before Twitter API changes, there was a website and Twitter account that would
  track realtime emoji usage across Twitter and tracked how often they would be used.🚡was
  the least used for quite some time and it became a bit of a meme,” u/TropicalBacon
  explained.</p>

  <p>They went on to add that, “Over time, it fell out of the ranking and 🔣 became
  the least used.”</p>

  <p>TropicalBacon also forwarded a link to the website in question, <a href="https://emojitracker.com/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Emojitracker</a>. Although the site is
  now offline, its last update shows the crying laughing face was in the lead with
  3,838,853,523 uses across Twitter. However, the aerial tramway, which had 484,029
  uses, was far from the bottom. (Actually at the bottom? The emoji TropicalBacon
  mentioned, aka "Input symbol for symbols.")</p>

  <p>Reporting on the trend for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17613850/twitter-least-used-emoji-tramway"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The Verge</a> in 2018, Shoshana Wodinsky
  speculated that the tramway emoji was elevated to popularity because it could be
  easily anthropomorphized, unlike some of the other unpopular emojis. She also spoke
  to Emojitracker creator Matthew Rothenberg, who agreed that the little yellow tram
  was “pretty darn cute.”</p>
