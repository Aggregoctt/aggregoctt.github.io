  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A woman has gone viral on TikTok after recounting what she described as an unpleasant—and
  unnecessary—run-in with a Walmart employee.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Tonyse Dionn (@theonlytonysedion) said she was using self-checkout during a recent
  visit to her local Walmart. While there, she said she noticed a worker watching
  her closely.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>To make matters worse, the employee offered to scan Dionn’s items for her at
  the <em>self</em>-checkout station.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Every time I come in there, there’s always some [expletive],” Dionn added, suggesting
  this wasn’t her first frustrating encounter at that location.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As of Sunday, her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theonlytonysedion/video/7504711481322130734">video</a>
  calling out what she saw as poor customer service at Walmart had racked up nearly
  125,700 views.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happened-at-walmart-nbsp"><strong>What happened
  at Walmart?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the caption of her video, Dionn explained she was visiting Walmart on her
  day off. She was hoping for a low-key shopping trip. Instead, she said, the experience
  turned uncomfortable when a worker began to “stalk” her through the self-checkout
  process.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“This young lady here stood behind me as soon as I went to the register,” Dionn
  wrote. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She said she confronted the employee about why she was being watched but didn’t
  get a clear answer. Eventually, Dionn said, the worker stepped in to scan her groceries—something
  Dionn found both unnecessary and intrusive.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“I’ve never had this happen to me at my neighborhood Walmart,” she added, suggesting
  the treatment felt out of the ordinary.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Dionn went on to say she believed she was unfairly singled out—and possibly followed—while
  shopping.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“I most definitely know they would’ve never been following me in the store at
  all,” she said, implying that her casual, off-duty look may have led to her being
  profiled. Had she been in her work clothes or dressed more formally, she suggested,
  the situation might have played out differently.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But was Dionn actually targeted—or was the employee simply being overly helpful?
  Viewers were split.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-viewers-suggest-the-worker-had-good-intentions"><strong>Viewers
  suggest the worker had good intentions</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the comments section of Dionn’s video, some viewers pushed back on her claims.
  They said it’s common for Walmart employees to assist at self-checkout and argued
  the worker, who appeared to be in her 20s, was likely just following instructions
  from a manager.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“She’s forced to do that. It’s part of a CUSTOMER SERVICE initiative,” one TikToker
  wrote. “Believe me, it’s not personal toward you.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“That young lady is only doing her job,” another added. “Whatever happened isn’t
  her fault!”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Y’all do realize her team lead made her do that?” a third viewer said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Others, however, said they’d had similar experiences and felt just as uncomfortable.
  They echoed Dionn’s concerns, saying the worker’s behavior felt more intrusive than
  helpful.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Happened to me. They said it was a requirement,” one woman shared. “After she
  scanned everything, I tried to hand her the cash. She told me it wasn’t her job
  to load the cash… I walked out [of] the store empty-handed and went to Kroger. Wasn’t
  gone stress me out.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“I would’ve let her finish and then walked out,” another proclaimed. “Ain’t no
  way I would’ve paid. I stopped shopping there years ago.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Shopping at Walmart is so hostile and unpleasant, no matter what location,”
  a third TikToker wrote. “I try to avoid at all costs.”</p>

  with Walmart’s self-checkout</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Walmart’s checkout policies have sparked plenty of controversy lately. Some shoppers
  <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/no-more-walmart-self-checkout-2/">have complained</a>
  that self-checkout is being restricted to Walmart+ members at certain stores. Others
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/1ffy1ns/i_refused_to_use_the_self_checkout_today_and_it/">argue
  it’s unfair</a> when self-checkout is the only option—especially if they don’t have
  to do the job of a cashier.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>One shopper <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/walmart-self-checkout-policy-changes/">claimed</a>
  that, similar to Dionn, a worker began scanning her items without her consent.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>At the same time, there have been incidents that flip the script—where customers
  insist on having employees scan their items at the self-checkout. This happens even
  when workers say that goes against policy. In those cases, employees <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/walmart-self-checkout/">said
  it’s frustrating</a> when shoppers refuse to either use a staffed lane or scan items
  themselves.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>All of it suggests Walmart’s policies around checkout vary widely by store. Moreover,
  that inconsistency is annoying customers and employees alike.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
