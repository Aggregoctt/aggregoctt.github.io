  <p>You don’t have to bend the blade in your tape measure anymore. That’s because
  popular TikToker Sidney Raz (@sidneyraz), who shares <strong><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/life-hacks/">life
  hacks</a></strong> he’s learning in his 30s, just shared some very helpful newfound
  knowledge with the masses. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Here''s something I wish I knew before I was in my 30s,” Raz, who has over 4.5
  million followers, kicks off his video. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Tape measures have their length on them,” he exclaims before taking a closer
  look at the case on the tape measure and reading aloud in a strained voice, “3 inches.”&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He then demonstrates how useful this knowledge can be when applied. Raz measures
  the length of a windowsill. He pulls 29 inches of the blade out, and instead of
  bending the blade to get the windowsill’s full measurements, he uses the case to
  measure the rest. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“39 plus 3 is 42,” he says. “That was so much easier.”&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“This makes sense but i''m not happy about it so please let me know that I''m
  not alone,” Raz added in the caption. </p>
