  <p>An investigation into several <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/kroger/">Kroger</a>-owned
  grocery stores found that the brand may be overcharging customers using a sneaky
  mislabeling tactic.</p>

  Kroger mislabeling items to overcharge customers?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/may/14/kroger-supermarket-sales-tactics">the
  <em>Guardian</em></a>, which partnered with Consumer Reports and the Food &amp;
  Environment Reporting Network, several of the brand''s grocery stores routinely
  left up expired sale tags, only to charge customers more at checkout.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The investigation used secret shoppers and union grocery store workers in several
  states, who found that mislabeling resulted in overcharging in 14 out of 26 stores
  across 14 states and Washington, D.C.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A Kroger worker told the <em>Guardian</em> that many employees know about the
  issue and "feel bad" when customers don''t notice the discrepancy at checkout.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"They think that when they took it off the shelf, it was $2.50. They don’t know
  that they’re paying $3.75 for that one item," a scan coordinator told the Guardian
  in an interview.</p>

  <p>This isn''t the first time Kroger has been questioned about pricing practices.
  In August 2024, <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-casey-investigate-krogers-use-of-digital-price-tags-warn-of-grocery-giants-surge-pricing-causing-price-gouging-and-hurting-consumers#:~:text=Washington%2C%20D.C.%20%E2%80%93%20Today%2C%20U.S.,grocery%20prices%20and%20exploit%20consumers.">Kroger
  was investigated</a> by U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bob Casey for allegedly
  using electronic tagging to engage in "surge pricing," or increasing the price during
  busy hours.</p>

  <p>In the comments of a blog by Cele|bitchy, Kroger customers said they also noticed
  pricing discrepancies.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I take pics of the prices as I go. Then I argue. I’m in CO and it’s been ridiculous

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I think these places just count on most people not noticing. I won’t set foot

  another said.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I think this happened to me the other day! The total was more than I was expecting
  based on the listed prices, but I figured I was just remembering wrong," a third
  shared.</p>
