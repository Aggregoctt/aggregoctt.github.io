  <p>If you’ve swiped your card at a <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/dollar-general/">Dollar
  General</a> in northwest <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/iowa/">Iowa</a>
  recently, you might want to check your account.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to the Lyon County Sheriff’s Office, card skimmers were found at two
  Dollar General locations. One was found in George, and another was just 15 minutes
  away in Rock Rapids.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The sheriff’s office is now urging customers to keep an eye out for any suspicious
  transactions.</p>

  the skimmers found?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The investigation started when employees at the George location spotted something
  off with their card reader and called the police.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Officers showed up and confirmed their suspicions: someone had installed a card
  skimmer, a device that <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/scams/">secretly steals</a>
  debit or <a href="https://dailydot.com/tags/credit-cards">credit card</a> info when
  you use a terminal.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Later that same day, staff at the Rock Rapids location noticed something similar.
  Police were called again, and another skimming device was found.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Now, law enforcement is reviewing security footage and trying to figure out who
  installed the devices, when it happened, and how many customers may be affected.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The Lyon County Sheriff’s Office says the investigation is still ongoing. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the meantime, anyone who used a card at either store has been strongly encouraged
  to check their bank accounts and report any unauthorized charges right away.</p>

  post</a> by <a href="https://www.ktiv.com/">KTIV News 4</a>, commenters expressed
  their frustration—and suspicion.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“And every store has cameras at the registers to watch for theft, but no one
  can tell who did this?” one person asked.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another warned others to be more cautious. “Keep your eyes open when swiping
  your cards,” they wrote.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Someone else claimed they may have already been affected. “They should check
  the one in Riverside,” they wrote. “I used it there, and 2 days later had fraud
  on my card.”</p>
