  <p>Comedian Leslie Jones repeatedly insulted Elon Musk during a <em>Daily Show</em>
  segment and got conservatives feeling threatened. On Wednesday''s show, she roasted
  the X owner, President <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/donald-trump/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>, and his administration, calling them
  corrupt, evil, and above all, goofy as hell. Over on Musk''s social media site,
  his fans declared that she literally threatened him, among other even-keeled reactions.</p>

  <p>Jones has long made her name with an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/24/1214464900/how-comic-leslie-jones-went-from-funniest-person-on-campus-to-snl-star"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">uncompromising comedic style</a> that
  includes a lot of swearing and a refusal to hold back her feelings on any subject.
  The right-wing reactions are a bit like if you accused Triumph the Insult Comic
  Dog of threatening to actually poop on someone.</p>

  Jones on Elon Musk: ''I''d give his a** a black eye''</h2>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><em>The Daily Show</em> invited former guest host <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/leslie-jones/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Leslie Jones</a> back on May 14 for a
  segment on the people currently "running" the U.S. government, including DOGE head
  <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/elon-musk/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Elon
  Musk</a>. The comedian focused on what many others have observed about this administration—that
  they''re a bunch of goofy weirdos who <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/crosswalk-hack-elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">can''t get friends</a> without paying
  them.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"It’s not that they’re corrupt. Although, they are," she explained. "It’s not
  that they’re evil. Although, they are. It’s not that they are women-hating, racist,
  unqualified d*ckheads who couldn’t run a Dunkin’ Donuts without burning it down.
  No, my problem is these people are goofy a** motherf*ckers!"</p>

  The comedian dragged him for failing to take matters seriously when he''s responsible

  <p>Ever since social media site owners started their conservative turn, the definition
  of a credible threat seems to shift massively depending on the context. Jones is
  far from the first liberal to be accused of threatening someone to the point that
  some called for her arrest because she targeted an individual within or connected
  to the Trump administration.</p>

  <p>On <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/fox-news/" rel="noreferrer noopener"

  <p>"He knew exactly what that meant … it meant assassination," he said. "It says
