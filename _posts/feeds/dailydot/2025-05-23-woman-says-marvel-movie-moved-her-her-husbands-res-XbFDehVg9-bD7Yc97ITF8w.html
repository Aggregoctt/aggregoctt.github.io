  <p>A TikTok user’s story about an interaction with her husband during a spontaneous
  date night raised red flags for commenters. TikTok user Jenni Maharidge (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jenni.mah"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">@jenni.mah</a>) posted a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jenni.mah/video/7506871841932217642"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">video</a> earlier this week where she
  explained why a response she received from her husband after the couple viewed the
  new Marvel movie <em>Thunderbolts </em>caused her to break down over dinner.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In her video, which has over one million views and has since transcended platforms,
  Maharidge shared that her husband took her to the theater, and even though she knew
  nothing about the story, she loved the film. She was excited to discuss the movie
  over dinner, but felt compelled to stop talking after her husband "looks at me dead
  in my face and says ‘It was just a movie.’”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><em>Thunderbolts</em> is a film about a group of antiheroes forced to collaborate
  on a mission requiring them to confront their pasts. Florence Pugh and Sebastian
  Stan lead the ensemble cast and Julia Louis-Dreyfus stars as the movie''s antagonist,
  Valentina Allegra de Fontaine.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Later on in her video, Maharidge clarified that her husband apologized for his
  remarks during dinner by saying that he loves when she gets excited, but “it’s just
  annoying sometimes.” </p>

  <p>Commenters were thrown by the exchange. @Seriouslyidontbloat wrote “Your happiness

  <p>Maharidge concluded her video by stating that she knows her husband is trying
  to communicate with her. “It’s not an overnight process but it is very painful,”
  she said. “He’s still new to his healing journey so I just have to keep remembering
  that.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The video was cross-posted to <a href="https://x.com/heyjoydoe/status/1925307618987270650">X</a>,
  where folks referenced actress Jenifer Lewis, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shredidiah/video/7173027291738475819"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">who previously talked</a> about breaking
  up with a man who was unable to acknowledge the positive things in life, like a
  beautiful pink tree. More importantly, he had acted annoyed at her joy over this
  simple pleasure.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Jennifer Lewis was right," wrote @heyjoydoe in a quote-retweet of the video
  on X, where it racked up nearly 185,000 likes. "It''s not just the pink trees."</p>

  <p>This emotional epiphany was brought to you by the new movie <em>Thunderbolts</em>.
  It might be "just a movie," but it''s still cheaper than therapy.</p>
