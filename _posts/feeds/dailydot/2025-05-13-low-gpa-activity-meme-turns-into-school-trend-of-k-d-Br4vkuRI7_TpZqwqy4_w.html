  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Videos of kids setting fire to Chromebooks are going viral in a supposed TikTok
  "trend," causing outrage and debate over whether there''s a new wave of classroom
  vandalism spreading, or if we''re seeing another round of internet-fueled moral
  panic. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Though some are cracking jokes, footage of Chromebooks smoking and going up in
  flames has teachers seriously concerned that the trend is spreading and encouraging
  vandalism in schools. Others are drawing comparisons to previous online ‘trends’
  such as <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/what-is-tide-pod-challenge/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">2018’s Tide Pod Challenge</a>. The firestarter method?
  Shoving pencil lead or metal into laptop charging ports.</p>

  the videos show—and what''s really happening</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The videos typically take place in classrooms and show Chromebooks emitting black
  smoke as students watch on and film from nearby. Many are tagged with phrases like
  "anything but work" and "low GPA activity"—the latter of which now shows a content
  warning as of May 13.</p>

  inserting small metal items like pens, pencils and staples into the laptops’ charging

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The video has accumulated over 291K views and thousands of comments, many of

  <p>The videos have also ignited further debate among cultural commentators and news
  outlets. “I feel like this is one of those things where a kid sees it online and
  doesn’t think it’s actually real,” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thegardenstatepodcast/video/7502519148862262558?q=setting%20chromebook%20on%20fire&amp;t=1747136754974"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">said one host</a> on The Garden State
  Podcast, who compared it to the Tide Pod challenge.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-kids-actually-setting-fire-to-chromebooks"><strong>Are
  kids actually setting fire to Chromebooks?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But just like Tide Pods—how much of this is occurring in reality vs online moral
  panic? Teachers flocked to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1kf727r/new_tiktok_trend_starting_fires_with_chromebooks/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recent Reddit post</a> on the r/teachers
  subreddit to share their thoughts on the trend and how widespread it actually was.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Several of my 8th graders were doing it this week. Thankfully nothing major
  happened, but I did write them up,” user Jader9377 confirmed. “Oof, we had the fire
  alarm go off today for this exact reason,” added Heroic00. “I work in a K12 as a
  middle school teacher and sounds like a high schooler did exactly what was described
  above.”&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“What fresh hell is this?” someone added in disbelief.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Others debated over what was causing it. “The genesis of this was in like 2021
  when kids found out that the mask string could saw through most anything”, one commenter
  said—referring to a wave of vandalism-related trends from 2022 dubbed "<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/irl/tiktok-devious-licks-bathrooms/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">devious licks</a>" that involved kids
  sawing through chairs with Covid masks, stealing soap dispensers, and clogging toilets.
  <em>The Washington Post</em> would later report that this was <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/devious-licks-trend-meta-tiktok-campaign/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a deliberate publicity stunt</a> orchestrated
  by Meta, though the company would go on to challenge this. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Regardless of whether or not these videos constitute a trend, their consequences
  are visible. On May 12, Live5news reported that a 15-year-old student <a href="https://www.live5news.com/2025/05/12/15-year-old-charged-high-school-laptop-fire-believed-be-part-tiktok-challenge/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">had been charged with third-degree arson</a>
  after using a mechanical pencil to set a Chromebook on fire at Belleville High School,
  New Jersey.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“The message is ‘Parents, please watch your kids.’ There are serious implications
  for doing something wrong like this,” Belleville Police Chief Mark Minichini told
  Live5News.&nbsp;</p>
