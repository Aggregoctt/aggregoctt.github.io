  <p>Do you shop for household essentials on Amazon? Make sure you immediately stop
  using the following items, which are <a href="https://parade.com/news/amazon-kitchen-bathroom-sink-faucet-brands-lead-warning-may-2025"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">now considered hazardous</a> by U.S. consumer
  protection officials.</p>

  <p>You might be thinking the list involves <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/walmart-beans-recall/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">human</a> or <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/petco-treat-warning/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">pet</a> food, but it doesn’t. In this
  case, the health hazard involves several kitchen and bathroom faucets, according
  to a May 14 <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cpsc-warns-consumers-to-stop-using-certain-chinese-made-faucets-sold-on-amazoncom-infants-young-children-and-pregnant-women-at-risk-of-dangerous-lead-exposure-302455917.html"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">statement</a> from the U.S. Consumer Product
  Safety Commission.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The faucets in question are all made by different Chinese manufacturers and range
  in price from $30-$50. The models include:</p>

  <ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

  <li>VESLA HOME Kitchen Faucet by VESLA HOME</li>

  <li>KZH Bathroom Faucet by Yajie Sanitaryware</li>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to the commission, the faucets can potentially leach lead into drinking
  water. That is, of course, extremely dangerous to humans. “Lead ingestion can cause
  harmful neurological effects on infants, young children, and pregnant women, including
  attention-related behavioral problems, decreased cognitive performance, and lower
  IQ,” the statement reads.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Stop using these products immediately and replace them with another product as
  soon as possible. If you have one of the faucets and can’t immediately replace it,
  make sure to run the water for 15 seconds before consuming. When you run the water,
  it has less time to come into contact with lead in the plumbing system.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>It’s important to note that boiling water does not remove lead from water. However,
  you should regularly clean your faucet to remove built up sediment and particles.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The commission is reportedly going to announce enforcement actions against the
  companies sometime soon.</p>
