  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>27-year-old <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/mrbeast/">MrBeast</a>, whose
  real name is Jimmy Donaldson, started making philanthropic challenge videos on <a
  href="https://dailydot.com/tags/youtube">YouTube</a>, such as giving away large
  sums of money to charities, generously tipping service workers, and raising money
  to plant 20 million trees.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Since then, MrBeast has partnered with other platforms like Amazon Prime to produce
  <em><a href="https://passionfru.it/beast-games-commissioned-two-more-seasons-163236/">Beast
  Games</a></em>, a game show where 1,000 participants compete for $5,000,000. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The deal with Amazon paid MrBeast around $100 million. In January, MrBeast offered
  to buy TikTok to avoid the United States'' ban on the popular social media app.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He was asked in a February 2025 episode of Steven Bartlett''s Diary of a CEO
  if he''s a billionaire. MrBeast <a href="https://x.com/DramaAlert/status/1892812523155374149">replied</a>,
  "On paper, yeah, but I mean, in my actual bank account, I have less than a million
  dollars."</p>

  <p>A recent report by <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/producers/jimmy-donaldson-aka-mrbeast-net-worth/">Celebrity
  Net Worth</a> seemingly confirms that MrBeast now has a net worth of $1 billion,
  raking in nearly $50 million a month from various projects.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In 2024, he topped the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2024/10/28/top-creators-2024-the-influencers-turning-buzz-into-billions/">Forbes

  <p>Despite branding himself as a philanthropist, some viewers have criticized MrBeast''s
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKoSFqGsE_g">unethical</a> business practices.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Following these claims, many viewers weren''t impressed with MrBeast''s rise
  to billionaire-dom. Some pointed to his ties to tech billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg
  and Elon Musk, with one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mrbeastsnark/comments/1krem9t/comment/mtcta5f/">saying</a>,
  "All hail the oligarch of YouTube!"</p>
