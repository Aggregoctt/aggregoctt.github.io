  <p>Check your cucumbers, people. The Food and Drug Administration is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/outbreak-investigation-salmonella-cucumbers-may-2025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recalling</a> a specific brand of cucumbers
  due to a Salmonella outbreak impacting more than a dozen states. Here’s how to avoid
  exposure.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to the FDA, contaminated cucumbers grown by Bedner Growers, Inc., and
  distributed by Fresh Start Produce Sales, Inc., are linked to Salmonella poisoning
  in 20 people. Fresh Start distributed cucumbers to retailers, distribution centers,
  wholesalers, and food distributors from April 29 to May 19.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Additionally, Bedner’s Farm Fresh Market sold recalled cucumbers at its Farm
  Fresh Market and to its wholesale distributor. Retailers could’ve picked up the
  contaminated cucumbers at any of three Florida locations, including Boynton Beach,
  Delray Beach, and West Palm Beach between April 29 and May 14.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The FDA is working to track down every contaminated cucumber sold to consumers.
  It advises any retailers that may have distributed the cucumbers to notify customers
  about the recall. The retailers are also encouraged to sanitize any areas or bins
  where the cucumbers were stored and, of course, dispose of any contaminated produce.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Consumers can contact their retailers to learn if the cucumbers they bought during
  that period of time came from Bedner. It’s important to note that not all of them
  are sold with a Bedner sticker. So better to be safe than sorry.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Generally, people get sick within 12 to 72 hours after Salmonella exposure. And
  the symptoms of diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps can last between four and
  seven days. Check in with a doctor if you think you have it.</p>
