  <p>Home Depot is facing the wrath of angry customers after quietly removing the
  DEI section from its website. </p>

  <p>According to the <em><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/home-depot-customer-boycott-dei-policy-b2750723.html">Independent</a>,</em>
  customers are voicing outrage over the move.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-started-the-backlash">What started the backlash?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A few days ago, the store <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/home-depot-removes-dei-from-website/">remove
  its DEI page</a> from its website.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The move reportedly came in response to the mounting pressure from conservatives
  and the Trump Administration to scale back on DEI efforts.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The store replaced its DEI page with a ‚ÄúWeAreTHD‚Äù page.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre proud to have a culture that welcomes everyone, and we believe it helps
  us achieve our business goals,‚Äù a Home Depot spokesperson told Retail Brew, which
  first reported on the site change, in a statement. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been using ‚ÄòWeAreTHD,‚Äô
  which is a slogan that represents the welcoming culture we‚Äôve built here. We remain
  committed to our core values and the needs of our business, empowering associates,
  driving innovation, and enriching our communities.‚Äù</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This move to erase DEI policies, along with the ensuing backlash, mirrors actions
  taken by other companies. </p>

  <p>A few months ago, Target announced it would <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/target-hand-model/">roll
  back DEI initiatives</a>, resulting in calls for a 40-day boycott. Target''s foot
  traffic and stock price<a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2025/04/21/did-the-target-boycott-over-dei-work-heres-what-we-know/83194331007/">
