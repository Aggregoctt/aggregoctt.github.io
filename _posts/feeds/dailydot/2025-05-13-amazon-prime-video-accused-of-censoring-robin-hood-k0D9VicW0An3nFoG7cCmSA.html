  <p>An online conspiracy theory claims that Amazon Prime Video censored the Russell
  Crow film <em>Robin Hood</em> to protect the oligarchy.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A TikTok recently documented an issue with the playback of the 2010 film. On
  Amazon Prime Video, the film was missing an intro text that should read, “When law
  oppresses the people, the outlaw takes his place in history.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Of course, the TikTok got picked up on X. A user there <a href="https://x.com/MAGACult2/status/1919583029556564408"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">speculated</a> that Amazon might have
  intentionally stripped the film of that message. “In 2025, truth like that doesn’t
  vanish by accident,” the user wrote.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That unsurprisingly got some people so riled up that they reached out to fact-checking
  website Snopes, which published an <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/05/08/robin-hood-russell-crowe-2010-amazon/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">article</a> on the subject late last week.
  Apparently, this claim goes back years despite being pretty easily explainable.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The subtext of the claim is that Amazon—whose CEO Jeff Bezos is facing claims
  that he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/27/america-billionaires-bezos-zuckerberg-musk"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">operates in an oligarchy</a> under U.S.
  President Donald Trump—censored the intro from the <em>Robin Hood</em> film because
  said-oligarchy doesn’t want that message out in the ether at this time.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That is, of course, an absolutely wild theory. But Snopes is known for taking
  the most outlandish theories and thoughtfully debunking them. So the outlet contacted
  Amazon and asked a spokesperson about it. The spokesperson attributed the issue
  to a simple technical error and said the company uploaded a new, corrected version.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>So it’s not likely this had anything to do with the Trump administration. The
  simplest solution is usually the correct one. In this case, a digital media expert
  told Snopes that Amazon likely uploaded a “textless version” of the film by accident.</p>
