  <p>A woman happened to take a can of <strong><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/febreze-small-spaces-for-cars-vs-air-freshener-walmart/">Febreze</a></strong>
  outside, and what she discovered has customers swearing off the product. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Korah McGraw (@pretty_chea) was upset after she brought a brand new can of Febreze
  out onto her porch. With the natural light of the sun behind the canister, she was
  able to see just how much liquid it had in it. Suffice to say, she wasn’t happy.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The TikToker addressed Febreze in the caption of her post, saying she was extremely
  “disappointed.” She also added, “I feel scammed.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the video she explains her grievance. She claims that she was looking at one
  of the new air fresheners she had just purchased when she noticed the level of the
  liquid inside seemed depleted.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Thinking that canister had probably been sprayed in the store, McGraw checked
  the others. But she found they had the same amount of liquid in them. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“This is where they fill the Febreze up to. It’s empty y’all,” she exclaims,
  holding the bottles up to the light.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-customers-are-equally-enraged">Customers are
  equally enraged</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Several other Febreze users were disappointed by the amount of liquid inside
  the Febreze canisters.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“That bottom part covered by color is solid plastic. It doesn’t even go all the
  way down. I stopped buying once I found that out,” one person claimed.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“They do this [with] everything &amp; they say you’re paying for the amount of
  product not the container,” another said.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A third person said they had yelled at their kids for wasting the room spray
  before they finally checked an unopened canister.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-are-febreze-cans-only-halfway-full">Why are
  Febreze cans only halfway full?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A few commenters attempted to explain that the company was not trying to pull
  a fast one on its customers. The reason the Febreze canisters appear partially full
  is because of the science behind aerosol sprays.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Aerosol cans appear to be half empty, but the space is actually filled with compressed
  gas. This gas, like nitrogen, acts as a propellant and pushes out the fragrance
  spray in a safe and even manner.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>One commenter named Andrew suggested an alternative to spray scents: “Get the
  plug in, they last so many months.”&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, several commenters disputed the claim that the plug-ins last a long
  time. <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/plug-in-air-freshener-brain-altering-chemicals/">Plug-in
  fragrances</a> also reportedly <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/glade-air-wick-plug-ins-headache/">cause
  headaches</a> among users, and they can also be a fire hazard.</p>

  are alternatives to store-bought room scents?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While room sprays, candles, and scent diffusers are popular ways to add scents
  to a room, some of them can have adverse effects.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Many commercial room scents are made with synthetic fragrances that can irritate
  the lungs or even trigger allergies. Whenever possible, opt for scents that use
  natural, non-toxic ingredients, or make your own room fragrance by boiling ingredients
  like lemon and cloves over the stove. </p>
