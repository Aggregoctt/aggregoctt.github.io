  <p>Royal Caribbean is banning travel routers from its cruises, and travelers—particularly
  influencers—are in shambles over the new policy.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to a February <a href="https://www.thetravel.com/royal-caribbean-bans-portable-internet-router/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">report</a> in The Travel, Royal Caribbean
  cited security concerns when it announced a ban on portable router devices on its
  cruise ships. If you aren’t a regular on cruises, this tidbit might fly right over
  your head. But this has <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fgjgtn1/video/7502839919576894766"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">serious implications</a> for cruise enthusiasts.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Cruise lines enforce a long list of rules designed to keep people safe while
  out at sea. In this case, however, some travelers think the change has more to do
  with the fact that portable routers helped people circumvent the cruise line’s strict
  rules with regard to Wi-Fi. Service on Royal Caribbean is called the VOOM Surf &amp;
  Stream package.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Some of Royal Caribbean’s ships are even upgraded to feature SpaceX Starlink.
  That Wi-Fi service is even faster than its previous offering, and you pay the same
  price.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Unfortunately, that price is <a href="https://www.royalcaribbean.com/guides/wifi-cruise-packages"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">upwards</a> of $15.99 per device per day,
  and you are also limited in the number of devices you can connect without paying
  more. YouTuber La Lido Loca said the portable routers are “essential” for any cruise.
  Otherwise, travelers are inundated with fees to add additional devices to their
  packages.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, not everyone agrees that this qualifies as oppression. Some viewers
  in La Lido Loca’s comments question why anyone would need to be that plugged in
  on a cruise in the first place. Allegedly, these trips are intended primarily for
  relaxation.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That might not be the case if going on cruises and making videos about it is
  your main source of income. Others said they’ve used the portable routers when going
  off the ship at different ports.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Royal Caribbean isn’t the only cruise line frustrating travelers by banning certain
  items. Carnival Cruise Line famously doesn’t allow Bluetooth speakers.</p>
