  <p>A <strong><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/walmart/">Walmart</a></strong>
  shopper found a Shark vacuum at roughly 85% off. She showed viewers how she discovered
  the <strong><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/do-walmart-hidden-clearance-deals-exist/">hidden
  clearance</a></strong> deal in a TikTok that''s been seen 164,000 times.</p>

  <p>"Alright, look, I''m about to show you how this works," Retail Therapy (@retailtherapy32),
  a clearance deal hunter and couponer, says. She whips out her Walmart app to scan
  the barcode on the box. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p>It''s important that Walmart shoppers looking for hidden clearance deals ensure
  the physical location they are in matches the in-app location. This is an important
  first step, as hidden clearance deals vary by location. </p>

  <p>James Rochester, CFO at CashBlog, spoke with <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-secret-ways-save-money-180053755.html">Yahoo
  Finance</a> about Walmart''s hidden clearance deals. He said that store managers
  are responsible for setting the clearance prices after receiving word from corporate
  that they need to mark the items down. "This indicates that clearance pricing [is]
  not consistent across the board,” Rochester told Yahoo Finance.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>TikToker Retail Therapy then shows that the app says the price of the vacuum
  is $34 at the location she is in. The exact model of the vacuum appears to be the
  Shark Upright Vacuum, Navigator Advanced Lift-Away, which retails for $239. This
  is likely the price at which the vacuum is being advertised in the store. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Retail Therapy then takes the vacuum up to the front of the store. She uses self-checkout
  to ring the item up. She shows her receipt to viewers as proof that she only paid
  $34 for the vacuum.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>It''s best to use self-checkout when you find deals like this, as there have
  been reports of retail workers <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/target-pickleball-zero-dollars/">blocking
  such purchases</a>.</p>
