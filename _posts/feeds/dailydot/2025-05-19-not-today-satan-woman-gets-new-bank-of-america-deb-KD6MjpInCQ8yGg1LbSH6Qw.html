  <p>A <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/bank-of-america/"><strong>Bank of America</strong></a>
  customer was shocked after receiving a debit card with a 666 CVC code. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Charisma (@charismatev) uploaded to TikTok, where her video about the situation
  garnered over 82,000 views.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"So I got a new debit card, ''cause someone kept doing fraud on my last one,"
  she explains.  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The TikToker opens up a piece of mail. It''s a card that she received from Bank
  of America. Packaged with the card is a terms and conditions sheet. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She doesn''t seem to take issue with any of the terms attached to using the card.
  "I''m looking at the package, OK cool, looking at my numbers," she says as her tone
  dramatically changes. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>It''s because of the card''s CVC code. "Take a wild guess, Bank of America, by
  the way. Three, two, you guessed it. 666," she says. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She shows the CVC code on her card. "I do not want to deposit with the devil.
  Do not want to withdraw witchcraft," she says, looking down. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>An image of a shredded card pops up on the screen‚Äîshowcasing the lengths Charisma
  went through to rebuke the card. "To the banks out there, some numbers should be
  off limits," she claims. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I understand not everyone''s Christian, not everyone believes in that stuff.
  If you believe there''s evil in this world, there has to be a source of that evil,"
  she adds. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-666-considered-a-bad-number">Why is 666
  considered a "bad" number? </h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>There are several reasons why "666" has been associated with wrongdoing. For
  starters, it''s called "the number of the beast" in the Bible. "Here is wisdom.
  Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number
  is that of a man; and his number is 666," one translation of the Bible''s Book of
  Revelation says, per<a href="https://history.howstuffworks.com/history-vs-myth/666.htm">
  howstuffworks</a>. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Contrary to popular belief, who exactly the "Beast" is is unclear, though many
  think it''s the Antichrist or Satan, who are not one and the same. Also, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/number-of-the-beast#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20the%20beast,signify%20the%20Antichrist%20or%20Satan.">the
  exact number has been contested</a>. There is some discourse as to whether or not
  the true "number of the beast" refers to "616," not "666."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-666-is-not-always-a-bad-number">666 is not always
  a bad number</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to howstuffworks, "666" can also be a good sign. "Repeated single digits
  that have spiritual meaning for those who believe in guardian angels or spirit guides.
  In the world of angel numbers, 666 isn''t a bad omen," it notes. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The outlet says that the number can serve as a gentle reminder to not lose sight
  of the larger picture by sweating the small stuff. It can also be a reminder, in
  regards to one''s love life, to prioritize or deprioritize one''s love life, depending
  on if the people in it are good or bad. Lastly, in regards to one''s career, it
  can be a reminder to set good work-life boundaries. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This number is apparently all about balance. "The true meaning of this angel
  number is to bring balance to your life," howstuffworks notes. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Some folks weren''t really freaked out by seeing the number but rather found
  Charisma''s editing humorous. "The cut to it being destroyed is cracking me up,"
  one penned.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But there were others who were right on board with the TikToker''s line of thinking.
  "This happened to me. I took it to the bank and asked for a new card so quick. Don‚Äôt
  play with me!" one person said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While another replied, "I don‚Äôt blame you. Not today Satan."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"That happened to me, before immediately ordered a new one," another user penned.</p>
