  <p>Pope Leo XIV held his first press conference on Monday and started out by addressing
  one of the biggest subjects of our time: <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/ai/">artificial
  intelligence</a> (AI). </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Speaking to members of the media, he urged them to use AI with “responsibility
  and discernment,” warning of its growing power and potential dangers.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-the-pope-think-of-ai"><strong>What
  does the </strong><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/popes/"><strong>Pope</strong></a><strong>
  think of AI?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The Pope’s message was that AI isn’t inherently bad, but it can’t be left unchecked.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“It can be used for the good of all,” he said, “so that it can benefit all of
  humanity.” But that depends on how we choose to handle it.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He reminded journalists and communicators that they, too, are part of the larger
  social fabric. “The Church must face the challenges posed by the times,” he said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“In the same way, communication and journalism do not exist outside of time and
  history.” Quoting Saint Augustine, he added, “Let us live well, and the times will
  be good. We are the times.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Interestingly, Pope Leo said that the rise of AI also influenced his choice of
  name. While addressing the College of Cardinals on <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/may/documents/20250510-collegio-cardinalizio.html">Saturday</a>,
  he explained why he chose “Leo XIV.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“There are different reasons for this,” he said, “but mainly because Pope Leo
  XIII in his historic Encyclical Rerum Novarum addressed the social question in the
  context of the first great industrial revolution.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-people-saying-online"><strong>What are
  people saying online?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The Pope’s comments quickly made their way online, where people didn’t just take
  notice—they made connections.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1kjgq4s/pope_leo_xiv_lays_out_vision_of_papacy_and/">post</a>
  to Reddit’s r/Europe thread, many users said they were glad to see a religious leader
  taking AI seriously.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“While this world is cruel and a bit crazy right now, I do appreciate living
  in a time where popes are talking about artificial intelligence,” one person said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind,” another joked.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>From there, the <em>Dune</em> comparisons poured in. “Are we starting the path
  to 40k Warhammer or Dune and the Thinking Machines?” someone joked.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Still, others backed the Pope’s concerns with a warning of their own.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“All these Dune references are funny,” one user wrote, “but the man is totally
  right about the threat of AI. Just imagine what tyranny is possible with it. It
  can look at every message and every phone call. It can closely inspect video streams
  from every camera on the street. The authoritarian government will be greatly empowered
  by such a thing.”</p>
