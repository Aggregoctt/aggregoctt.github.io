  <p>Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/05/roblox-launches-shopify-integration-amp-licensing-program">just
  rolled out</a> a feature that lets creators sell real-world <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/merchandise/">merchandise</a>
  directly inside their games.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Through its new Commerce API, with Shopify as their first partner, players can
  now buy physical items like hoodies or T-shirts while exploring a <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/roblox/">Roblox</a>
  experience, and get a matching avatar item to go with it.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-can-users-purchase-these-items"><strong>How
  can users purchase these items?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The new feature lives inside something called a “premium shop.” It works like
  this: if you’re in a Roblox <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/gaming/">game</a>
  that supports the feature, you’ll see a merch section where items are listed—think
  shirts, accessories, and other creator-branded stuff.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Click on what you want, and a separate checkout page pops up with product details
  and payment options. For now, it’s available in all-ages experiences for U.S. users
  aged 13 and up.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>An early example is Rihanna''s <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/rihanna/">Fenty
  Beauty</a>. The brand <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/ai-shopping-google/">already
  lets</a> users try on digital cosmetics inside its Roblox experience, including
  selling a lip gloss shade that’s exclusive to the platform.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/the-weeknd/">The Weeknd</a>
  is also getting in on the action. According to Roblox, he’s expected to start selling
  merch soon through his upcoming Roblox experience.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-else-is-new-with-roblox"><strong>What else
  is new with Roblox?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In addition to the Shopify partnership, Roblox is also rolling out a new Approved
  Merchandiser Program. The idea is to let creators, brands, and artists link real-world
  purchases to digital rewards.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>So instead of buying digital items online, you can buy a physical item—say, from
  a retail store—and unlock a matching digital item on Roblox.&nbsp;</p>
