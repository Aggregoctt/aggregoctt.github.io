  <p>This weekend marks the end for seven<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/jcpenney/">
  JCPenney</a> stores across the country.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The closures, first announced<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/11/jcpenney-closing-stores-2025-list">
  back in February</a>, are set to take effect on Saturday, May 25, giving shoppers
  just a few more days to say goodbye.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The move comes a few months after JCPenney announced its partnership with <a
  href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/forever-21/">Forever 21</a> to launch a new
  venture called Catalyst Brands, which also includes Lucky Brand, Brooks Brothers,
  Nautica, Eddie Bauer, and Aéropostale.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Over on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deadmalls/comments/1inni8t/jcpenney_store_closings_end_of_the_mall/">post</a>
  at Reddit’s r/deadmalls, commenters didn’t seem too rattled by the news. Some saw
  it more as a reflection of the state of the malls themselves than the JCPenney brand.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“I would argue that JCPenney closing in those locations is more of an indication
  that those malls are already dying,” one person wrote.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another pointed to recent events. “I’m not surprised about Asheville considering
  the hurricane last year,” they wrote.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>And for some, the closures just felt inevitable.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Malls and JCPenney both have been dying so yeah, it’s just the way life is,”
  wrote a third. “There’s a thing called Amazon, which actually gets two things to
  your house even sometime same day and everything costs less. It’s a great thing
  and it’s much better than the mall—nobody’s coughing on you.”</p>
