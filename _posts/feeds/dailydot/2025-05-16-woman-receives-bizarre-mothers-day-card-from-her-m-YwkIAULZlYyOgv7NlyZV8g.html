  <p>It''s relatively normal for family members to interfere with your life, especially
  when they believe they''re doing what''s best for you. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But how far is too far? This is the question Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1klf3ig/aio_extremely_upset/">u/ivysweatpants</a>
  is grappling with after her mother receives a Mother''s Day card from her mother''s
  boyfriend masquerading as her infant daughter.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1klf3ig/aio_extremely_upset/">post</a>
  on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/">r/AmIOverreacting</a>
  subreddit, the Redditor began by explaining that she had only met her mother''s
  boyfriend three times, and that he lives in a different state from her mother. "They
  are both extremely anti-vax and both sovereign citizens and are always trying to
  push their views on me and my husband," the user explained.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"My mom is so deep into the sovereign movement because of this guy (whom she
  met at a conference) that she has a warrant out for her arrest and a suspended license."

  gone wrong</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>After her mother''s boyfriend allegedly disrespected her boundaries by discussing
  vaccinating her two-year-old, the Reddit user claims that he sent her mother a Mother''s
  Day card saying it was from the Redditor''s young daughter without consulting the
  Redditor and her husband.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the card, which was photographed by the Redditor, the "daughter" tells the
  grandmother, "Thanks for telling Momma to hold off on all those shots!"</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The Redditor continues: "He even talked bad about me in the voice of my daughter
  in this card he sent my mom about my choice to get her vaccines—and then PROCEEDS
  TO SIGN HER NAME WITH HEARTS (like the letter was written by her). "WTF!??? This
  man has never even held my daughter, I’ve maybe said 50 words total to him ever
  in my life yet he’s addressing my mom in the voice of my infant daughter?!?!?"</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-redditors-sound-off-with-advice">Redditors sound
  off with advice</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the comments, Redditors were equally as befuddled by the situation. One Redditor
  called the boyfriend a "predator," while another said that his behavior was "bat***t
  crazy." Another commenter said that they got "major creep vibes" from the boyfriend
  and encouraged the Reddit user to stay away. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"You are definitely overreacting," a Redditor quipped. "It’s totally normal to
  pretend to channel a little girl''s thoughts in efforts to stop you from vaccinating
  them."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Elsewhere, a further commenter advised the Redditor not to downplay this situation,
  noting how, by making this card, the boyfriend is arguably trying to "manipulate
  your mother''s own reality."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, the most upvoted response to this Reddit post suggested that the Redditor
  takes the high road.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Once you let go of it, you will live much happier," they advised. "These messages
  will roll off your back and you''ll dump it in the "as expected" shit heap. Don''t
  let the crazy of two grown adults who you have no control over run your life. Let
  them be crazy and let them deal with the consequences. You are doing it right, so
  find peace."</p>
