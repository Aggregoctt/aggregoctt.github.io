  <p>When it comes to beverages, TikTok is the perfect place to discover something
  new. We''ve all seen just how viral TikTok drinks can be, from Starbucks'' "secret
  menus" to our lockdown obsession with whipped coffee. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The latest drink of the moment is the recently-released Sprite + Tea, which,
  according to The Street, came from a viral TikTok trend of people dipping their
  teabags into Sprite.</p>

  <p>“We’re always listening to our consumers, but this particular phenomenon motivated
  us to explore how we could offer our own refreshing take on tea,” Kate Schaufelberger,
  Brand Director, Sprite North America, said in a<a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/sprite-drops-refreshing-take-on-tea-with-new-lto-sprite-tea">
  statement</a>. “Sprite fans love variety, not just in flavor but in the ways we
  bring refreshment to life through unique multisensorial experiences that stay true
  to the essence of the brand.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to AP Chaney, Senior Creative Director of Sparkling Flavors North America,
  Sprite + Tea was initially an intern project. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"When it blew up on TikTok with millions of views, it was a gut check that we
  were on the right track," Chaney added. "Because you never go wrong when you listen
  to consumers and tap into what they''re doing by becoming part of their everyday.”</p>

  <p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Soda/comments/1kp7tvq/thoughts_on_sprite_tea/">Reddit
  post</a> about the drink, users shared why they were divided by the beverage. <br
  />"Torn on this one - flavor is not bad, but I can''t get over carbonated iced tea,
  and I was not ready for how that hit," one wrote.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"It has a very off-putting artificial tea flavor," another added. "Somehow doesn’t
  taste very sweet even with something outrageous like 65 grams of sugar. Imagine
  a watered-down brisk mixed with a cheap club soda. Not a fan. I had the plastic
  bottle version so maybe the canned version will taste better."</p>

  <p>While a third added: "I didn''t try it, but it looks threatening. Soda with a
  threatening aura."</p>

  <p>Others were less threatened by the drink, with a further user adding, "I like
  it a lot, I''m not a tea lover, but this was a great drink and will be in my summer
  rotation!" Elsewhere, a Redditor added: "I like it. I think the flavors go well
  together."</p>
