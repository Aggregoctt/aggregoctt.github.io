  <p>A rumor circulating on social media claims that all 10 inmates who escaped from
  a New Orleans jail are Gemini signs. Astrology fans are loving the moment, arguing
  that those born between May 21 and June 20 would totally break out of jail.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>They may find themselves disappointed to learn that many of the 10 are not Geminis,
  according to local news.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-orleans-jail-inmate-escape-armed-dangerous/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">10 men fled</a> from the Orleans Parish
  sheriff on May 15, just after midnight. According to the Sheriff''s Office, the
  inmates breached a wall behind a toilet after pulling their cell door off its tracks
  to allow more prisoners to escape. They scaled the facility walls and dashed across
  the highway, disappearing into the community.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Police have recovered four of the escapees so far, but the other six are still
  at large.</p>

  Corey Boyd (05/26/2005), Antoine Massey (06/15/1992), and Derrick Groves (06/19/1997).
  The rest remain scattered across other star signs.</p>

  <p>Regardless, online rumors circulated that this was a fully Gemini operation.
  On X, user <a href="https://x.com/dasciaaa/status/1923461026999066816" rel="noreferrer

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"First of all, escaping prison, like planning that and doing that, you know,
  going through with that, that''s just very Gemini coded in the first place," he

  <p>He claims he knows "for a fact" that all 10 of them were talking about how their
  birthdays were coming up. This could not have been possible unless half were lying,
  but it''s still funny that the rest were all late May or June babies.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"That''s how I know astrology is real," the TikToker concluded.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to <a href="https://www.astrology.com/zodiac-signs/gemini" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">Astrology.com</a>, Geminis are smart, imaginative, and
  avid data collectors. These folks are "intellectually inclined, forever probing
  people and places in search of information." The New Orleans inmates certainly did
  some probing of some places, and now the sheriff looks the fool.</p>
