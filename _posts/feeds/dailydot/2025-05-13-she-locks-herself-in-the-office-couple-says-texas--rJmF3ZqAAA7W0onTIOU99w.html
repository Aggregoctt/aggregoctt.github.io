  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the United States, it’s customary to leave a tip at the end of a meal, typically
  between 15 and 25%. However, in recent years, it’s becoming more common to be asked
  for a tip outside of a restaurant and prompted to tip more money.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>For example, one diner was shocked to discover that the recommended tip amounts
  were <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/tipping-math-not-adding-up/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">significantly higher</a> than the percentages they claimed.
  Another customer noted that their son’s barber offered recommended tip percentages
  <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/69-percent-tip-for-haircut/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">up to 69%</a>.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While these high tip requests may be unpleasant for patrons, they can still choose
  not to pay them. However, in a video recently posted to TikTok and Instagram, one
  internet user says that they didn’t have a choice in the matter, and as a result,
  their card was fraudulently charged for a $100 tip.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-did-this-couple-end-up-paying-a-100-tip"><strong>How
  did this couple end up paying a $100 tip?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Although the creator’s video has since been removed from TikTok, user Tracy Lynn
  Gwynn (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tracygwynn1960/" rel="noreferrer noopener"
  target="_blank">@tracygwynn1960</a>) recently shared her unpleasant dining experience
  on Instagram.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In this video, she says that during the first week of April, she and her husband
  decided to visit the local Texas Roadhouse in Danville, Virginia. While the couple
  said they had previously had bad experiences at the restaurant, she claims that
  this time was significantly better.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“We had perfect service, we had perfect food, great experience, tipped well above
  what we should have tipped,” Gwynn says.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, when Gwynn’s husband checked his bank account, he discovered something
  shocking.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“The girl that waited on us changed our tip to a $100 tip,” Gwynn states, shocked.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-resolutions-go-nowhere"><strong>Resolutions go
  nowhere</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Immediately, Gwynn and her husband attempted to solve the issue. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>They contacted the restaurant, who allegedly told them that the money would be
  back in his account within days. This did not come to pass, and, according to Gwynn.
  “The bank even sent proof that they have had no activity of anybody trying to return
  the money to my husband''s account," she says.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Frustrated, Gwynn’s husband began posting his experience on social media, to
  which the restaurant allegedly responded by offering further proof that they had
  returned the money. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Despite this, the money did not return to Gwynn’s husband’s bank account. Throughout
  this time, Gwynn says she was told by staff that they were “shocked” that this server
  could have done this, though Gwynn alleges that other employees told her that this
  had happened before in the restaurant.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Eager to resolve the situation, Gwynn’s husband returned to the Texas Roadhouse.
  Even though Gwynn insists that he was not threatening, she claims that the owner
  of the restaurant refused to talk to him and locked herself in her office, instead
  directing him to call corporate.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>After reaching out to Texas Roadhouse corporate, the couple was told the money
  would be back in their account in two days. It has been weeks, and the money is
  still not in their account.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-should-you-do-if-a-server-increases-your-tip"><strong>What
  should you do if a server increases your tip?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In situations like these, the resolution can vary based on how one paid and what
  exactly occurred.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>For example, while it’s always advisable to try to resolve the situation with
  the restaurant directly first, those who paid via credit card are generally able
  to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1gyygtk/server_changed_tip_amount/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">dispute the transaction</a> with their
  credit card issuer, something that is more difficult than for those paying with
  a debit card.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In cases where the transaction cannot be easily disputed, a customer can try
  to resolve the issue with the restaurant. Then, if the issue cannot be fixed, they
  may want to consider contacting the police, as taking money from one’s account without
  their permission can constitute theft.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>For the time being, it appears that Gwynn is continuing to try to resolve the
  situation with the restaurant, though the <em>Daily Dot </em>has reached out to
  her via Instagram and TikTok DM, as well as to Texas Roadhouse via email, for comment.</p>
