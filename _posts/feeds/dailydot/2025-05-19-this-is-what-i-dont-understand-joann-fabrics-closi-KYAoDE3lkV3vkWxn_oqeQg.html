  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In February, <strong>Joann Fabrics</strong> announced that, following a Chapter
  11 <strong>bankruptcy</strong> filing, it would be <strong>shuttering all 500</strong>
  of its stores across the US.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Naturally, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/joann-fabrics-warning-facebook-pinterest/">Joann
  Fabrics</a> is hosting liquidation sales at most of its locations. But some aren''t
  so happy with the deals. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-joann-fabrics-closing">Why is Joann Fabrics
  closing?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A spokesperson for the company went into further detail about Joann''s closure.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Following a comprehensive sale process and auction, GA Group, together with
  the Prepetition Term Loan Agent, has been selected as the winning bidder to acquire
  substantially all of Joann’s assets. In connection with this agreement, subject
  to Bankruptcy Court approval of the transaction, the winning bidders plan to begin
  winding down the Company''s operations and conduct going-out-of-business sales at
  all store locations," a Joann spokesperson said in a statement to<a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/so-upset-shoppers-criticize-policy-for-joann-fabrics-closing-sales/3696747/">
  NBC</a>.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Joann leadership, our Board, advisors and legal partners made every possible
  effort to pursue a more favorable outcome that would keep the company in business,"
  the statement continues. "We are committed to working constructively with the winning
  bidder to ensure an orderly wind-down of operations that minimizes the impact on
  all our stakeholders. We deeply appreciate our dedicated Team Members, our customers
  and communities across the nation for their unwavering support for more than 80
  years.”</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-joann-fabrics-closing-sales">What are
  Joann Fabrics'' closing sales?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As a result, Joann announced a string of closing-down sales in their stores,
  but many customers were left dissatisfied.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In one viral TikTok, which was posted by Jamie (@sheepadoodleluna), the TikToker
  filmed herself roaming a Joann store with on-screen text reading: "POV: you went
  to Joann''s ''store closing,'' ''everything must go'' sale.''"</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Throughout the video, which amassed 290,100 views, Jamie zoomed in on some of
  the discount signs with a disappointed look on her face. In the clip, the discounts
  ranged from 20% to 50%.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the comments, users expressed their shock. "Not even bankruptcy can stop a
  company from being greedy bro," one quipped.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"This is what I don’t understand," another admitted. "They are closing all their
  stores, why they need the money for?" </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Several others also expressed their displeasure at the fact that the store no
  longer takes gift cards.</p>
