  <p>Ben Cohen, cofounder of Ben &amp; Jerry’s, was arrested Wednesday after interrupting
  a congressional hearing to protest the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Cohen stood
  and shouted during Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s testimony,
  accusing Congress of funding bombs that kill children in Gaza while cutting essential
  healthcare programs like Medicaid. The longtime activist, who has a history of speaking
  out for Palestinian rights, was led out and ziptied as he repeated his plea for
  aid to starving civilians.</p>

  <p>The protest by the <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/ben-and-jerrys/" rel="noreferrer
