  <p>Rumors of a new collaboration with everyone''s favorite spicy chip—<strong>Takis</strong>—were
  confirmed by a <strong>Wendy''s</strong> employee. They called out the non-believers
  in a viral TikTok showing off a box in the backroom of their <strong>Wendy''s location</strong>.
  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Preston Trey (@prestontrey06) shared a behind-the-scenes video of the special
  Takis box on Sunday.  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Thought they was lyin'' about them new Taki burgers," he wrote in the text overlay.
  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The collaboration was similarly teased online via an Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJqAbOkMgW3/?hl=en">post</a>
  from food influencer Markie Devo (@markie_devo).</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Kirk Tanner, president, chief executive officer and president of Wendy’s recently
  teased us on a new Takis menu. I got the speculated deets, so let’s talk about it,"
  Devo wrote in the post''s caption. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But what''s in this alleged <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/wendys">Wendy''s</a>
  Takis burger? Well, it''s not a burger at all—depending on your definition of a
  burger.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-wendy-s-takis-fuego-meal">What is
  the Wendy''s Takis Fuego Meal?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to Devo, the Takis Fuego Meal will highlight Takis via a chicken sandwich
  and specially seasoned fries. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The Fuego Chicken Sandwich features a spicy fried chicken filet with chili lime
  and cheddar cheese sauce. For that signature crunch, Wendy''s is topping the filet
  with crushed Takis Fuego chips and a creamy corn spread. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Move over, Popeyes. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Wendy''s didn''t forget about the side either. The sandwich''s partner in crime,
  Fuego Fries, will be tossed in chili lime seasoning. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-will-wendy-s-takis-fuego-meal-become-available">When
  will Wendy''s Takis Fuego Meal become available?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Devo''s post claims the meal is expected to hit Wendy''s menus around late June.
  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, Food Business News <a href="https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/28248-wendys-collaborating-with-mondelez-kellanova-takis-in-2025">said</a>
  Wendy''s will launch the meal as part of its 100 Days of Summer campaign on Memorial
  Day weekend. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Trey''s post featuring a box of Takis in the Wendy''s backroom is a good sign
  that the Takis meal is on the way soon.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-wendy-s-collaborating-with-takis">Why
  is Wendy''s collaborating with Takis?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Food Business News reported several Wendy''s collaborations on May 8, including
  the Mondelez and Kellanova collabs via the addition of Frosty Fusions.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Tanner told Food Business News that the Takis collaboration is a move to connect
  Wendy''s with younger generations. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“(Takis) connects with Gen Z customers,” he said. “It’s multicultural. It’s a
  customer group we’re going after. It drives traffic into our restaurants. The secret
  is how do you build on that? How does that become innovation off your core menu,
  and you create brand love through those experiences.”</p>

  <p>In the comments of Trey''s post, which has garnered over 3.4 million views, users
  weren''t impressed with the new collaboration. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Wendy’s just be doing anything," one commenter wrote.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Going be on the toilet for days [crying emoji]," another joked. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>One user said they weren''t expecting much for the Takis meal after being disappointed
  in <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/spongebob-squarepants-krabby-patty-wendy/">Wendy''s
  Krabby Patty meal</a>. "After the SpongeBob Collab, I lost faith on Wendy’s," they
  wrote. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Other Wendy''s workers also expressed stress at the menu addition, noting that
  the new Frosty Fusions have already upped their workload. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Man I’m already tired of making these dam fusions [crying emoji] now they doing
  Takis," one user wrote.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Having to make the new frostys wasn’t enough now i gotta sell them that," another
  said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Brooo I was so confused when I seen boxes of takis at my Wendy’s lmaoo," a third
  added.</p>

  <p>The Daily Dot reached out to Trey via TikTok direct message and to Wendy''s via
