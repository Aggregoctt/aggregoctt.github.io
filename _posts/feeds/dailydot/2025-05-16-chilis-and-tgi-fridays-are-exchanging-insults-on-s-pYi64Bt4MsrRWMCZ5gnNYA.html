  <p>Chain restaurants <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/chilis/">Chili''s</a>
  and <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/new-york-tgi-fridays-closing/">TGI Friday''s</a>
  feuded over their mozzarella sticks, sparking back and forth between the two brands
  on social media.</p>

  started the beef between Chili''s and TGI Friday''s?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On May 14, TGI Friday''s official X account posted a shady message targeting
  Chili''s mozzarella sticks.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Somebody tell [chili pepper emoji] to stay in their lane," <a href="https://x.com/Chilis/status/1923124183191441626">TGI
  Fridays wrote</a>. "Y’all are not mozzarella stick people. We are. That’s it. That’s
  the tweet."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The next day, Chili''s decided to clap back with its own post on X.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"@ us next time… Also, we honestly didn’t know you were still open. Congrats!"
  the post read.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>TGI Friday''s then responded to Chili''s reply. </p>

  <p>"Is the cheese pull challenge accepted or nah??" <a href="https://x.com/TGIFridays/status/1923131669302616389">TGI
  Friday''s asked</a>, challenging the other chain to a mozzarella stick competition.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-which-chain-has-the-best-mozzarella-sticks">Which
  chain has the best mozzarella sticks?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the comments of the X feud between Chili''s and TGI Friday''s, fans of both
  chains took sides.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I can’t remember the last time I seen a TGI Fridays except for in the frozen
  section," a Chili''s fan wrote. Chili''s replied to the comment, "ooooop."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Chili''s mozzarella sticks are [OK hand sign emoji]," another said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Thanks. Now I’m googling ''Chili’s near me'' to partake in some fine dining
  tonight," a third joked.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Some Chili''s supporters also pointed out that TGI Friday''s was sued in 2021
  because its frozen mozzarella sticks, which were available at grocery stores, didn''t
  actually contain any mozzarella, <a href="https://www.today.com/food/news/tgi-fridays-mozzarella-sticks-lawsuit-rcna60356">Today
  reported</a>. Instead, the sticks were filled with cheddar cheese.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Do they actually contain mozzarella now or nah?" one posted.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>TGI Friday''s fans pushed back.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Chili''s is for people who like slow-paced service and mediocre food. TGI Fridays
  is for the people who love to go out on the weekends and get lit!" a commenter said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"TGI Friday''s is the GOAT. No cap," another wrote.</p>
