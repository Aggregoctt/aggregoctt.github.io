  <p>Real estate marketplace <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/irl/zillow-35-house-neighorhood-for-sale/">Zillow</a>
  changes up its listing requirements, and some realtors say theirs may disappear
  from the site as a result.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-zillow-s-new-listing-requirements">What
  are Zillow''s new listing requirements?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Zillow requires realtors to list publicly marketed homes on the Multiple Listing
  Service (MLS) within one business day.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The MLS is a private database that agents and brokers access to list homes and
  identify properties for prospective buyers. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The new requirement may remove home listings that aren''t officially entered
  in the MLS from the site. This prevents agents from giving first dibs to certain
  colleagues before listing publicly on the MLS.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to <a href="https://www.realestatenews.com/2025/05/20/zillow-to-start-blocking-some-listings-in-june">Real
  Estate News</a>, a real estate agent who lists a home out of compliance may have
  the listing blocked. Zillow will begin to block listings on June 30. </p>

  will this change impact buyers and sellers?</h2>

  <p>Georgia realtor Tiffany Pinkney <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiffanypinkneyrealtor/video/7506372532136578334">posted
  a video</a> on TikTok explaining the change. She stands behind a yard sign and waves
  at the camera.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On-screen text reads, "When agents find out why half the listings are now missing
  from Zillow." In the caption, she explains that the goal of the new policy is "more
  transparency and equal access for buyers."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"This is your sign (literally and figuratively) to make sure your home search
  or sale is in the hands of a licensed agent who knows how to navigate these changes,"
  she writes.</p>

  title="@tiffanypinkneyrealtor">@tiffanypinkneyrealtor</a> As of May 1st, 2025, Zillow
  updated its listing policy: If a home is being publicly marketed (think: yard signs,
  social media posts, brokerage websites), it must also be listed on the MLS within
  one business day ‚Äî or else it won‚Äôt appear on Zillow or Trulia. The goal? More transparency
  and equal access for buyers. The result? Some properties that used to pop up on
  Zillow might now be invisible if they aren‚Äôt officially on the MLS yet. ‚ö†Ô∏è This
  is your sign (literally and figuratively) to make sure your home search or sale
  is in the hands of a licensed agent who knows how to navigate these changes. Looking
