  <p>In-N-Out''s classic pink lemonade and strawberry milkshakes just underwent a
  major change. The California-based burger and fry chain announced on Wednesday it
  removed artificial coloring from the two classic drink options. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to <a href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/in-n-out-burger-removes-artificial-coloring-from-products">KTVU</a>,
  the move comes after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested on April 22
  that brands from within the food industry to phase out artificial coloring in their
  products. In-N-Out is one of the first major food chains to seemingly voluntarilyy
  abide by the request. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In-N-Out also announced that it''s "transitioning to an upgraded ketchup." The
  current ketchup includes high-fructose corn syrup; the "upgraded ketchup" will include
  real sugar. </p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A worker on Reddit posted a May 6 company memo introducing the changes to its
  stores. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"You may notice a slight change to the color of our Signature Pink Lemonade or
  Strawberry Syrup in your store," it starts. "Good news: this is due to a quality
  improvement to both of these products."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The company says in the memo it will rely on natural instead of artificial coloring
  and notes that its "lite" pink lemonade already relies on natural coloring. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Notably, we will be the first in the industry to serve this healthier option,"
  the memo proudly reads. </p>

  <p>Over on Reddit, many customers and workers seem happy about the changes. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Some new good changes on their way!" the worker who posted the memo said. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A customer shared, "As someone who likes the Pink Lemonade, I’m very happy."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Others were more skeptical and cracked jokes about the irony of a fast-food joint
  focusing on getting rid of artificial dyes. "Good to know while I wait for my 3
  4x4 and cheese fries order," one of the top comments reads. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/food-dyes">Healthline</a>,
  "There is no conclusive evidence that food dyes are dangerous for most people. Nevertheless,
  they may cause allergic reactions in some people and hyperactivity in sensitive
  children. However, most food dyes are found in unhealthy processed foods that should
  be avoided anyway."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Because of that, Healthline recommends to "focus on eating nutritious whole foods
  that are naturally dye-free."</p>
