  <p><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/crying/">Crying</a> is a natural emotional
  response—but let’s face it, sometimes it shows up at the worst possible time.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Whether you''re in a meeting, mid-confrontation, or just trying to hold it together
  with your friends, you might wish you had a way to hold the tears back. So what
  do people actually do?</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That’s exactly what <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/tiktok/">TikTok</a>
  creator Dawna Rae Warren (@dawnaraewarren) wanted to know. In a recent video, she
  asked her followers, “What is your foolproof way to stop crying?”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Plenty of users chimed in with common tactics—breathing exercises, sipping water,
  and grounding techniques.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But one answer stood out above the rest.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-did-they-suggest"><strong>So… what did
  they suggest?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“I went to a conference where they said to avoid crying at work, you clench your
  butt as hard as you can. Life = changed,” one commenter wrote.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Warren couldn’t help but react. In a follow-up video, she stitched the comment,
  wide-eyed and intrigued.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Incredible advice,” she says. “What conference? What conference was this?”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-this-technique-actually-work"><strong>Does
  this technique actually work?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Surprisingly, yes—at least for some people.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a medically reviewed <a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/depression/how-to-stop-yourself-from-crying">blog
  post</a> from GoodRX, life coach Bob Greenaway shared his experience.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“My sister-in-law told me if you clench your butt cheeks when you feel the urge
  to cry, it stops it from happening," he wrote.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>At first, he didn’t buy it. But when it came time to give a eulogy at his stepfather’s
  funeral, he gave it a shot.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“I used it… and it worked like a charm,” he said. “It is now my go-to for those
  moments.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the same blog post, medical editor Dr. Patricia Pinto-Garcia also approved
  of the technique.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“These stories give some great options—whether it’s tapping or focusing on controlled
  muscle movements—these things can help you focus on something else and interrupt
  that reflexive crying response,” she explained.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-viewers-had-thoughts-and-questions"><strong>Viewers
  had thoughts—and questions</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the comments of Warren’s video, some people reflected on the social pressure
  to hold back tears, and others were ready to give the trick a try.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“I just cry,” one commenter wrote. “Why are men allowed to be angry but I’m not
  allowed to cry?”&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another joked, “Not sure but my kid’s softball coach must have went to the same
  conference.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>And a third person already had a plan.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Gonna use this tomorrow,” they wrote. “I’ve been putting off confronting my
  boss because I know I’ll cry.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
