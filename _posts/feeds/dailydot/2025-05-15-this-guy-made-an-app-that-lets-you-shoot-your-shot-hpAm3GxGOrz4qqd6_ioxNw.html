  <p>A young developer claimed to solve the awkward friend crush dilemma with a new
  kind of dating app called Mutual. According to Josh Wolk, the app allows you to
  anonymously confess to a friend that someone on their contact list likes them. If
  they, too, like someone on their list, they can choose to take a chance on romance.
  The hope is that this could avoid a friendship rupture in case that target isn''t
  looking for love.</p>

  <p>Whether this <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/apps/" rel="noreferrer noopener"
  target="_blank">app</a> would cause more success stories than disasters remains
  in question. Some commenters on Wolk''s announcement are already plotting to sow
  chaos among their buddies.</p>

  <p>If you''ve ever had a crush on a friend, you likely know the conflict between
  wanting to ask them out and fearing an end to a platonic relationship. Some of the
  best romantic futures can start with friendship, but a rejection can be too much
  for two pals to bear.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Wolk thinks he''s solved this with Mutual. According to his posts on X and TikTok,
  the app allows you to send an anonymous message telling a friend that someone on
  their contacts list likes them. If they also have a friend crush, the recipient
  can download the app, select anyone they like on their own list, and if one of those
  is the sender, it notifies both parties of the match.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>If the recipient does not select the sender, the app conceals their name, potentially
  avoiding a painful situation.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to Wolk, this process will allow you to essentially "ask your friends
  out without making things awkward."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-game-theory-for-dating">Game theory for dating</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In other videos, Wolk claimed to use "game theory" in his development of the
  app. Game theory, according to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/game-theory"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Britannica</a>, is a "branch of applied
  mathematics that provides tools for analyzing situations in which parties, called
  players, make decisions that are interdependent."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"This interdependence causes each player to consider the other player’s possible
  decisions, or strategies, in formulating strategy."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Basically, this young app maker attempted to take the high risk out of a situation
  that could produce a high reward. Normally, you would have to consider your crush''s
  interests and future decisions when risking a crush reveal in a situation Wolk calls
  the "proximity dilemma."</p>

  <p>"The closer you are friends with someone, the higher the potential for a high
  quality relationship," he assumed in a <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/tiktok/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">TikTok</a> video. "But also, the higher
  the perceived risk of ruining that friendship by expressing your feelings."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Wolk goes on to describe a "payoff matrix," assigning positive or negative numerical
  values to the act of asking a crush out or not and the resulting rejection or reciprocation.
  Two friends starting a relationship is an incredible reward, but a rejection could
  poison a friendship or even "blow up the friend group."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Therefore, many people elect to endure the low-level pain of never knowing how
  a crush feels about them. "How can we turn this on its head?" Wolk asked.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the comments on Wolk''s May 12, 2025, X post announcing the friend dating
  app Mutual, some appeared excited about the idea and even claimed to have tried
  it with positive results. However, plenty hated the idea, feeling that people need
  to simply get up the courage to ask a crush out without an app. "Alpha male" types
  took the most offense.</p>
