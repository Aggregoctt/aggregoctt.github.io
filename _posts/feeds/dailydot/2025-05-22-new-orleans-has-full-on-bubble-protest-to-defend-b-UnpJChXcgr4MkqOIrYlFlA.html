  <p>Only in <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/new-orleans/">New Orleans</a>
  would a petty complaint turn into a full-blown bubble-themed <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/protests/">protest</a>.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This past Sunday, May 18, people gathered in the French Quarter—not for a parade,
  not for Mardi Gras—but to defend a bar’s bubble machine.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The reason? Earlier in the week, Cafe Du Monde Vice President Burt Benrud went
  on <a href="https://wgno.com/video/bubble-machine-divides-french-quarter-street/10710981/?fbclid=IwY2xjawKQm19leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHoNjBzXqGEZqRc4A18JO1ow-p9hz2tfoRdSdNAM7XcxqlOChlWOGrHGN10O-_aem_93IGGWB7sg8tCbYWSLdkvg">local
  station WGNO</a> and threatened to sue MRB, a nearby bar, because its bubble machine
  occasionally sends a few floating orbs in the direction where he lives, according
  to the<a href="https://www.nola.com/gambit/news/the_latest/do-you-hear-the-bubbles-sing-new-orleanians-rally-round-mrb-bubble-machine/article_c38a3f6e-496b-4ac7-8a69-b7265c53ed09.html">
  Gambit</a>.</p>

  <p>"I’d like to enjoy my property, you know, and sit out on my balcony and have
  a cocktail without having to worry about a bubble landing on my drink,” Benrud reportedly
  told the station.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Benrud also expressed concern that the bubbles might mess with his Porsche SUV,
  which he parks across the street on St. Philip.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Locals weren’t having it. So, in true New Orleans fashion, they showed up—with
  bubbles.</p>

  did the protest look like?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>TikTok creator @olsenventures (Chris Olsen) posted a video from the protest that
  got over 300,000 views.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the video, the scene looked less like a protest and more like a party—complete
  with music, costumes, and, of course, bubbles everywhere.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Some rich dude in the Quarter threatened to sue a local bar over their bubble
  machine blowing bubbles on his Porsche,” Olsen wrote in the text overlay of his
  video. “So the French Quarter reacted! Hundreds of people came out yesterday to
  blow bubbles in front of his house and tell him—don’t move to New Orleans if you
  don’t like fun.”</p>

  chimed in, too</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Under the video, commenters shared their support for MRB—and their confusion
  over the whole ordeal.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Trying to legislate bubbles???” one person asked.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another compared it to city folks moving to the country and suddenly hating rural
  life.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Exactly,” they wrote. “Also, city people who move to the country complain about
  livestock odor, lack of convenience, driving behind tractors… and then wanna change
  it.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>And someone asked the obvious, “What’s he gonna do about Mardi Gras?” They added,
  “Lol the French Quarter isn’t for the quiet life.”</p>
