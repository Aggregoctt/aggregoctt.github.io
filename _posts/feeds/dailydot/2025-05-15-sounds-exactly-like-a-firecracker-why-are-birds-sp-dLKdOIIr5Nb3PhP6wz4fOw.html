  <p>A <strong>California</strong> community is in shambles after a series of <strong>birds
  spontaneously combusted</strong> without explanation in the neighborhood.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As <a href="https://people.com/california-residents-birds-exploding-multiple-dead-11734411"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> in <em>People</em> magazine
  this week, the residents of <strong>Richmond</strong> are raising the alarm about
  the <strong>more than 50 dead birds</strong> found in their neighborhood. Why are
  the neighbors so concerned? Well, there’s no clear cause of death.</p>

  combusting?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>One neighbor filmed one of the birds falling after dropping from a power line,
  which sparked speculation that it had been electrocuted. The Contra Costa County
  Sheriff’s Office looked into those claims and acknowledged it’s a possibility, but
  that theory was later debunked by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>To make things even weirder, the local electric company disagreed with that assessment.
  According to a Newsweek <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/dead-birds-richmond-california-explode-power-gun-2071521"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">report</a>, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
  told ABC 7 that the phenomenon is more likely caused by a person shooting the birds
  with a BB gun.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Of course, with no definitive answer, neighbors are left to wonder what’s really
  going on. One neighbor told Newsweek that the birds exploded upon landing. “And
  it’s just really violent,” they said. Another neighbor said it sounds like a firecracker
  is going off when the birds explode.</p>

  <p>Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/1klodod/more_than_50_birds_mysteriously_explode_in/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">commenters</a> are convinced that all
  signs point to someone shooting the birds with a .22 rimfire rifle. “You know what
  sounds exactly like a firecracker?” one user wrote. “A good ol’ .22 rimfire rifle
  that you can get from any sports shop in America for $150.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Some took it as an opportunity to do a little media critique. “Dept of Fish and
  Wildlife quoted in the article as saying it’s likely a BB gun or slingshot, but
  that wouldn’t be a m y s t e r i o u s headline,” wrote one person.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Others took this as an opportunity for some good old-fashioned conspiratorial
  thinking. “That’s what happens when you leave the birds on the charger for too long,”
  one person wrote.</p>
