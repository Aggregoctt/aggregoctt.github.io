  <p>A recent X post claimed that a Tinder user swiped right on two million women
  in five years—yes, that''s 2 million swipes—and only got one date, and people have
  questions. While the OP blamed the <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/dating/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">dating</a> app, saying it made men like
  Hayden invisible with its monetization tactics, others pointed the finger at the
  Tinder user himself.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Discourse spread as some pointed to flaws in the man''s account or theorized
  that his overuse of the app screwed with the algorithm. Others raised suspicions
  around the story after they did the math on all those swipes.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to the story told by <a href="https://x.com/signulll/status/1923019793466110320"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">@signulll</a> on May 15, 2025, 26-year-old
  Hayden—fishing enthusiast and Colt Ford fan—spent five years swiping right on two
  million <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/tinder/" rel="noreferrer noopener"
  target="_blank">Tinder</a> users, resulting in a single date that ended in "no spark."
  The X user called this behavior "the norm" before going on to describe how dating
  apps make money.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"[W]hen women get bombarded with likes, flattery, attention, it triggers this
  shopping mentality, men become products, &amp; women become discerning consumers,"
  the user claimed, "women’s standards shoot through the roof. [A]pps capitalize on

  dudes."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>They concluded that "this is how dating apps monetized both sides at scale, men

  <p>This explanation paints women with a broad brush made of stereotypes, but the
  X user does touch on themes that many others have suspected about apps like Tinder.
  As user <a href="https://x.com/nazbowling102/status/1922935609141662146" rel="noreferrer

  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">single company</a> with the same profit

  <p>"Begging you people to realize that dating apps aren''t real," they said. "All

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Two million rightward swipes is certainly an eye-catching number, but begs the
  question: Is it possible? X user <a href="https://x.com/Ukurikiyimfura0/status/1923054952751956136"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">@Ukurikiyimfura0</a> did the math and
  found that this many swipes over five years is a lot to fit into each day.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"1000 swipes per day for 5 years," they wrote alongside a gif of a man laughing
  hysterically.</p>

  <p>To be more precise, it''s over 1,095 swipes each day.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another user looked up the total number of Tinder users and took into account
  that only 24.2 percent are women. Assuming Hayden is straight, and he may well not
  be, that''s all of the single ladies on the app.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
