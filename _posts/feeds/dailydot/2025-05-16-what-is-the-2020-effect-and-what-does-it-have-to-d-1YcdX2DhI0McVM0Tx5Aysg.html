  <p>A new trend online is seeing users go outside and declare that the “2020 effect
  is over.”</p>

  <p>Those partaking in the trend are claiming that the world has finally regained
  its color after 4 years of dullness brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, often nicknamed
  the “2020 effect” or the “2020 curse.” </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Some are drawing comparisons to video games updating their graphics, while others
  feel the atmosphere outside reminds them of legendary summers from previous years,
  like 2016.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Videos showing the supposed end of the 2020 effect usually involve TikTokers
  stepping outside their homes to film their surroundings, which appear especially
  warm and oversaturated. </p>

  text on screen says “the og graphics returned” as the person filming opens their

  <p>Many in the comments agreed that the world seems brighter and more colorful this
  year and speculated why this might be. Krose89 commented, “It’s been feeling really
  different lately”, while Yash1 said, “Is it just me or does it feel like 2015 again?”</p>

  “boys they finally fixed the graphics bug”, and shows a green field with a bright

  <p>Others made reference to video games and graphics, with one user adding “they

  <p>It’s often paired with slideshows of childhood images, where commenters claim
  that the world felt more colorful when they were a kid. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The 2020 effect plays into these broader internet nostalgia trends, as well as
  nostalgia specifically for the pre-COVID period of 2015-2019, especially the summer
  of 2016, which many reminisce over due to viral trends like Pokémon Go.</p>

  <p>However, it’s not all about looking backwards. As the pandemic period draws to
  a close, there is also a distinct sense of optimism from many users and a feeling
  of looking forward to the future, with some commenters claiming that “4 years of
  bad luck from scrolling are over.” Perhaps a <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/internet-culture-newsletter-vibe-shift/"
