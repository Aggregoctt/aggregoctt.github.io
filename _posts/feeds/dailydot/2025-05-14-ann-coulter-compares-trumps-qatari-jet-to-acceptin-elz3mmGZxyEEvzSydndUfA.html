  <p>Ann Coulter smugly compared President Donald Trump accepting a $400 million luxury
  jet from Qatar to France gifting the U.S. the Statue of Liberty. It did not go well
  for her.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Trump has been under fire as of late after being offered a jet so luxurious,
  itâ€™s referred to as a "palace in the sky." The idea is that it will temporarily
  replace Air Force One, then ultimately be decommissioned after Trump leaves office
  and be given to his presidential library.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>To many, it looks precisely like a very large, very public bribe from another
  country. Itâ€™s raised security concerns, left experts <a href="https://abc7.com/post/converting-luxury-jet-gifted-trump-air-force-could-cost-hundreds-millions/16414970/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">pointing</a> out American taxpayers will
  actually foot a hefty bill for it, and had others <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2eylpdg9po"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">alleging that it is illegal</a> and unconstitutional.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Trump has remained unconcerned and appears poised to accept the jet, even as
  folks who normally bend over backwards to support him <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/culture/trump-qatar-jet-maga-criticism/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">express their dissent</a>.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But heâ€™s got at least one right-winger in his corner. Conservative pundit and
  lawyer Ann Coulter took to X to defend the president.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I canâ€™t wait for the press to find out about Franceâ€™s so-called ''gift'' of
  the Statue of Liberty, accepted in 1886 by then-President Grover Cleveland," she
  wrote on Tuesday.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-the-statue-of-liberty-and-the-qatari-jet-the-same">Are
  the Statue of Liberty and the Qatari jet the same?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"The President was authorized and directed to accept the statue by a joint resolution
  of Congress on March 3,1877," reads the context added to her post. "As of 5/13/25,
  there is no indication Congress will be voting on acceptance of Qatarâ€™s plane."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Thatâ€™s a fairly key point. The Statue of Liberty was accepted as a gift legally
  and with the full approval of Congress. Thatâ€™s part of why we have different branches
  of government, even if some Trump fans believe that anything he does should inherently
  be legal simply because he is the president.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>There are also several other things to consider within this comparison. First,
  the Statue of Liberty was worth $250,000 in 1880. That translates to around $7 million
  today, although some suggest that if it were literally built today, the increase
  in other costs could make that shoot up to $20 million. Either way, itâ€™s a far cry
  from $400 million.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Secondlyâ€”and also quite importantâ€”is that Cleveland did not keep the Statue of
  Liberty for himself after he left office. The optics about what might have gone
  on behind the scenes are entirely different when one gift is a symbol intended for
  the entire country and another primarily benefits one person.</p>
