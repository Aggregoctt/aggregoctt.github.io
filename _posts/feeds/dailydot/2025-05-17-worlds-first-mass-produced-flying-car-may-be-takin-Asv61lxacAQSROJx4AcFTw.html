  <p>Shouldn’t we all be <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/flying-cars-vtol"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">driving flying cars</a> by now? Wasn’t
  that the future cartoons and sci-fi films promised us? Well, maybe we’re not as
  far off as previously thought.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Klein Vision is a Slovakian company founded by inventor Stefan Klein and businessman
  Anton Zajac in 2017. After decades of work across two companies, Klein is <a href="https://newatlas.com/aircraft/klein-vision-aircar-flying-car-production/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">closer than ever</a> to getting his flying
  car certified with aviation authorities and into production.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The fifth-generation prototype of the AirCar is due in September, and the company
  is aiming to start production and customer deliveries by early 2026. It’ll cost
  a pretty penny at a starting price of $800,000.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Not only does it boast a wildly futuristic, four-wheel design, but the AirCar
  can transform automatically between its flying and driving modes. Drivers—uh, pilots—can
  push a few buttons and go from driving to flying in just a few minutes.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-specs">Specs</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>You might be wondering about specs. Think sports car with a V6 engine and elbow
  room that can also transform into a small aircraft at virtually a moment’s notice.
  It’s basically if Bruce Wayne decided to open a Batmobile dealership.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>If commercial flying cars become a reality, what is the internet going to complain
  about next? Clearly not our society’s lack of vehicles that can drive, fly, and
  swim. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That’s because Klein is reportedly looking toward an amphibian model as soon
  as he completes his 30-year vision of mass-producing a flying car.</p>
