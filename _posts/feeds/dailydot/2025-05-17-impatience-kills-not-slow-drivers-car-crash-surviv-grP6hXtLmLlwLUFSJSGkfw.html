  five things she says every driver should stop doing</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Ambrelyn introduced her list with this reminder: “Driving a car is one of the
  most dangerous things that you can do on a daily basis because you''re literally
  operating a machine that could kill you or people around you.”&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She’s right—according to the <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/cdc" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">CDC</a>, motor vehicle crashes are among the leading causes
  of death in the US. Over 120 people die in car accidents daily.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Here are Ambrelyn’s tips:</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>

  <ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

  <li>Only sit the way you are supposed to&nbsp;</li>

  <p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

  <li>No claw clips, glasses that can shatter, or other hazards&nbsp;</li>

  <p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

  <li>Ensure pets, kids, and passengers are safely placed</li>

  <p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

  <li>Be aware of tools, decorations, or other things that can harm you if they go
  flying</li>

  <p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

  <li>FOLLOW THE RULES OF THE ROAD! Get off your phone!!&nbsp;</li>

  <p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>

  <p><!-- /wp:list --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The TikToker asserted that drivers enter into an agreement with other drivers
  and passengers each time they get behind the wheel. Ignoring safety guidelines can
  have tragic consequences.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Whenever we get behind the wheel, we are agreeing to a set of guidelines about
  how you are going to act and how I''m going to act,” said Ambrelyn, “And when you
  deviate from those and you force somebody to make a split second decision or assumption,
  that is when accidents are most likely to happen.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“So just have respect for human life and be safe out there.”</p>
