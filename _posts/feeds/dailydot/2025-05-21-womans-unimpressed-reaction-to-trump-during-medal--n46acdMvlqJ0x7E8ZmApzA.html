  <p>A viral clip from a recent medal ceremony has critics of President Donald Trump
  applauding a woman’s blank-faced demeanor as she accepted an honor from the president.
  Alexandria Diaz, who received the Medal of Sacrifice on behalf of her late father,
  a Florida police officer, appeared visibly unimpressed by Trump, igniting praise
  from left-leaning corners of social media. Though she became somewhat of a protest
  icon, Diaz says the attention is her "worst nightmare," and she''s making it clear
  she is not a Republican or a cop, and has no interest in being a meme, either.</p>

  Medals of Sacrifice </h2>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On May 19, 2025, Trump presented Diaz with the Medal of Sacrifice for her father,
  who died in a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/wellington/2024/12/03/they-were-lions-family-friends-honor-pbso-deputies-killed-in-crash/76731087007/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">traffic accident</a> along with two fellow
  officers in Palm Beach, Florida, last November. His daughter accepted the medal
  with a blank face and refused the president''s offer to speak with the press.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>As the video went viral online, left-wing social media users praised Diaz for
  what they perceived as a cold response to being in the presence of the current U.S.
  President. This was, of course, a somber event, but Diaz appeared immune to Trump''s
  charm, responding with a blank-faced "thank you" to his "I''m really proud of you."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Right before this, Trump glances at her face with a look that his critics interpreted
  as confusion and distress.</p>

  <p>The footage soon began to circulate on <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/tiktok/">TikTok</a>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Despite all the praise from the left, Diaz hated to see herself plastered all
  over the internet. In the only video on her TikTok account, posted on May 20, she
  explains that she never wanted to go viral. However, she needed to make a few things
  clear.</p>
