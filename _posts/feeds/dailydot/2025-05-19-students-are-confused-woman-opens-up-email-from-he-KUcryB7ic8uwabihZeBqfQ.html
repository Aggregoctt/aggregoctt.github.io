  <p>In recent years, students have used <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/grammarly-turnitin-ai-detection-warning/">AI</a>
  to generate essays and complete assignments. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1498309/usage-of-ai-by-students-worldwide/">Statista</a>
  revealed that a whopping 86% have reported having AI help them with schoolwork.
  Although students are barred from using it, one woman learned that teachers aren''t
  after her canceled class via an AI-generated song. </p>

  <p>“Well, that is something new from my teacher,” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@music4life071/video/7484322096848391467">@music4life071</a>
  wrote in the text overlay, tilting her head side to side, her mouth agape and face
  scrunched in perplexity. Then, she shows 3 million viewers what she is referring
  to.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>When she turns the camera to face her computer, she unveils a “no class tomorrow”
  email with a video file attached. Once the content creator clicks on it, an AI Song
  Generator: Vibe video pops up in the corner of the screen and plays it.  “Ayo fam,
  it''s your teacher, and I’m down bad. I''m coughing like crazy, my head is feeling
  mad. I’m not ghosting, just caught a bug,” a female AI voice sings.</p>

  <p>The song continues becoming what some might find cringy, “Wish I could teach,
  but I’m snuggled up. No class today, no cap. Sipping on tea, tryna fix this peak.
  Y’all get a pass but don’t act sus or I’ll drop a pop quiz, yeah.” @music4life071
  is at a loss for words, the camera flipping to reveal her even more puzzled expression
  than before. “Idk how to react,” she says in the text overlay.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She spoke on behalf of all students in the caption, “All students are confused
  af.”</p>

  <p>However, whether this clip is a skit or real is unknown since @music4life071
  posts similar content where the same sender has been her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@music4life071/video/7475356266857205038">“boss”</a>
  and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@music4life071/video/7473962797018303790">“classmate.”</a></p>

  <p>Most took this at face value and cracked jokes. “Who left AI unattended with

  <p>“So funny she’s trying to keep up with this generation,” a second jested.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Moreover, some teachers would’ve done this as well. “As a millennial professor,
  I would definitely troll my students with this,” one user stated.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“As a professor who was sick last week, I am so mad I am just now seeing this,”
  another emarked.</p>
