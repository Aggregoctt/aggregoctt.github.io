  <p>A parody TikTok account for <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@visit.yellowstone">Yellowstone
  National Park</a> sparked a viral TikTok trend after it seemed to turn to rather
  unorthodox methods to drum up Gen Z interest. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Using TikTok as a marketing tool is hardly new, but in a humorous twist, many
  viewers were fooled into thinking that the official Yellowstone National Park TikTok
  account was posting literal thirst traps.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Some of these TikToks feature muscular men chopping wood and flexing. Others
  consist of supercuts of some of the parks'' most aesthetic areas while suggestive
  music plays in the background. A further video even included the indisputable king
  of thirst traps, Pedro Pascal.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While the account is strictly parody, several of these clips concerning Yellowstone
  National Park have amassed millions of views. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>It''s also clear to see that, parody or not, these TikToks have gone down a storm
  with viewers, with many sharing their opinions in the comments section of these
  videos.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Who do we tell that whoever runs this account needs a raise," one opined. "Cause
  THIS is marketing."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I don’t understand why he’s upset, I follow Yellowstone National Park for educational
  reasons!" another insisted. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While a third admitted, "I''m going to be visiting just because of this account."
  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a fourth commenter seemed to speak for many when they said, "Whoever
  is running your social media today needs a raise because I have not laughed so hard
  in such a long time. I''m thoroughly loving it."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The parody account for Yellowstone National Park has become so popular that similar
  parody accounts of other parks, like as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@visit.yosemite?referer_url=parade.com%2Fnews%2Fviral-national-park-thirst-trap-videos-ignite-total-online-frenzy&amp;refer=embed&amp;embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404358%2C121497414%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C73347566%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121503376%3Bnull%3Bembed_masking&amp;referer_video_id=7503072759447178542">Yosemite
  National Park</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@olympicnationalpark">Olympic
  National Park</a>, have started following suit. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>And it looks like viewers couldn''t be more entertained. "ParkTok us where it''s
  at," one wrote. "Love this side of TikTok."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"This national parks spicy thirst trap drama tok is hilarious," another added.
