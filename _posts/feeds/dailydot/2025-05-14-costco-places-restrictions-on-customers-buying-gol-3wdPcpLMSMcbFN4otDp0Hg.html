  <p>Maybe flipping <strong>Costco</strong> <strong>gold</strong> isn’t the answer
  to your <strong>financial problems</strong>. That’s because the company is limiting
  purchases of its 24-karat gold bars after they went too viral online.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A personal finance influencer <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/finance-influencer-sells-costco-gold/">recently
  went</a> viral on TikTok after making almost $600 in profit from selling a 1-ounce
  gold bar he purchased from Costco in the spring of 2024. Some viewers questioned
  whether he sold at the right time, but he isn’t the only one selling right now.</p>

  <p>A Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-10-07/costco-gold-bars-sell-out-as-bullion-prices-hit-record-highs">article</a>
  from October 2024 details how Costco struggled to maintain its inventory of the
  gold bars as the price of bullion skyrocketed. The <a href="https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-14706899/Will-gold-prices-soon-hit-4-000-reached-peak-Experts-verdict.html">price
  of gold</a> is up over $3,200 and is expected to increase.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That probably explains why customers can only buy one Rand Refinery 1-ounce gold
  bar per transaction at a minimum of two units per day. The bars are nonrefundable
  and obviously are not eligible for price adjustments. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>So you’re not going to buy a gold bar from Costco one day and then return it
  for a higher price the next year. You’ll have to go to a gold and silver shop for
  that.</p>

  is only helping the retailer bring in even more revenue. </p>

  <p>That’s the curse of being a successful influencer. If your audience grows too
  large, your cost-saving tips might ruin the good time for everyone.</p>
