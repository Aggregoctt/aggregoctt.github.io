  <p>After 14 years, <em>Final Destination</em> is officially returning to movie theaters.
  And it''s fair to say that its marketing methods are already attracting attention.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Across TikTok and X, a logging truck featuring the <em>Final Destination</em>
  title has been going viral. To the uninitiated, this seems like a pretty random
  marketing tactic. But for committed fans of the <em>Final Destination</em> franchise,
  it''ll no doubt give them a shiver down their spine.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This is because a logging truck became a main character in 2003''s <em>Final
  Destination 2</em>. Like all <em>Final Destination</em> movies, this sequel was
  centered around people who were able to "cheat" death. They do this by having premonitions
  of rather violent (and creative) ways to die. The fact that these people cheated
  death and had these premonitions led to Death trying to hunt them down, leading
  to a cat-and-mouse chase.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>One such premonition at the beginning of the movie involved cars being battered
  by logs from a logging truck. It led to a pretty nasty highway pile-up.</p>

  <p>In the years since, the traumatizing scene has become infamous. It''s also pretty
  clear that the scene has just as much impact as it did 22 years ago, with a TikTok
  of the promotional truck amassing 17.1 million views. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the comments, several TikTok users referred to how the log scene triggered
  their "generational trauma," with one commenter remarking how this is "generational
  marketing at its finest."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another commenter described the ad as "diabolical," noting how they "still don’t
  drive behind logging trucks to this day."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While a third commenter admitted, "I think I’ve thought of final destination
  every time I’ve passed a semi truck for 20+ years since it came out."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Elsewhere, a fourth commenter joked, "They''re mocking us now."</p>

  <p>As if this weren''t enough, the team behind <em>Final Destination</em> also made
  an impact with their billboard advertisements, which appear to feature two signage
  workers falling to their deaths.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Several netizens remarked that they thought the billboard was real. Combined
  with the log truck, it''s clear that <em>Final Destination</em> is pushing advertising
  to its limit. Let''s just hope it''s worth it.</p>
