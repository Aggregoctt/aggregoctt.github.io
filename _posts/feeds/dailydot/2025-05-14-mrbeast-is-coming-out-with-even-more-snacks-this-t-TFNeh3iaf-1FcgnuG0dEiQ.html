  <p>Jack Link''s meat snack company announced a partnership with content creator
  MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson). The duo plan to launch a product marketed as "Beast Packs."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>MrBeast is no stranger to parlaying his internet fame into securing successful
  deals. In 2024, he became YouTube''s most-subscribed channel across the globe.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>It currently generates 2 billion views each month across multiple languages and
  platforms.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>His Prime Video series, <em>Beast Games</em>, is the streaming channel''s most-watched
  unscripted series. Known for high-stakes challenges and charitable giveaways, MrBeast''s
  brand has become synonymous with entertainment and generosity. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>This is also not his first snack line. In 2022, MrBeast launched his snack brand
  Feastables, which sells mostly chocolate bars. In 2024, MrBeast teamed up with fellow
  YouTubers KSI and Logan Paul to launch Lunchly, a Lunchables competitor.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-about-beast-packs">More about "Beast Packs"</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>The MrBeast/Jack Link''s partnership will roll out a new line of individual-sized
  beef jerky and meat sticks with MrBeast''s signature branding and flair.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>The meat snack company hopes the move will help captivate the younger market
  that MrBeast has successfully engaged across digital channels like YouTube, TikTok,
  and Instagram.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>“We are incredibly excited to partner with MrBeast,” the chief executive officer
  of Jack Link''s said. “Jimmy’s entrepreneurial spirit and dedication to his fans
  align perfectly with our values at Jack Link’s. We believe this collaboration will
  drive a new generation of consumers into the meat snacks category worldwide.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>According to data from Mintel, 33% of younger consumers regularly consume snacks.
  Yet, only 9% eat meat snacks.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>The partnership will target Gen Alpha, Gen Z, and their parents, which could
  potentially be a cash cow for the brand. With snack sales soaring among youth, a
  personality like MrBeast could prove to be a game-changer.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-huge-move-for-the-social-media-influencer">Huge
  move for the social media influencer</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>This brand collaboration is a very big deal.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>Jack Link''s is one of the world''s largest privately owned food companies. Meanwhile,
  MrBeast is the world''s #1 social media influencer, with a massive following and
  unmatched engagement.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>The brokered deal signals a significant shift in how big food brands decide to
  market their products.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>Digital influencers are certainly now playing a significant role in shaping consumer
  behavior and brand loyalty.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The product will be rolled out during the Sweets &amp; Snacks Expo in Indianapolis
  between May 13 and 15, marking the beginning of what could become a global snacking
  phenomenon.</p>
