  <p>Have you ever wondered why your laundry is never ready when the timer says it
  will be? There''s apparently a reason why your washing machine''s timer isn''t all
  that accurate, according to a popular LaundryTok creator.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Responding to another TikToker frustrated with her laundry''s inaccurate timer,
  LaundryTok creator Melissa Pateras (@melissadilkespateras) shares that the time
  is more of an "estimate; a hopeful, naive guess."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"It''s basically sizing up the load and saying, ''Hang on. We''re going to be
  here a while.''<br />Most newer washing machines use load sensing to determine the
  size of the load. And based on that, the machine will adjust [the] water level and
  cycle time," Pateras, who has over 1.7 million followers, explains.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Pateras notes that your machine is simply working smarter so that you don''t
  have to work harder by rewashing "the load over and over again."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She says, "The initial estimated time is based on an average load. But if what
  you put in is heavier or dirtier, it may add longer agitation or rinsing and spin
  times to ensure that the load is properly cleaned."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Pateras then lists the other reasons why your machine''s timer may be giving
  an inaccurate reading. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:list --></p>

  <ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

  <li>You use a detergent that''s incompatible with your machine.  </li>

  <p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

  <li>You use too much detergent (more soap = extra rinsing time). </li>

  <p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

  <li>You put a full load of laundry on the wrong cycle, like a "quick-wash" cycle.</li>

  <p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

  <li>You overfill the machine. </li>

  <p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

  <p><!-- /wp:list --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Your washer isn''t trying to gaslight you," Pateras reassures viewers before
  shifting blame to user error. "It''s just trying to survive your laundry habits."</p>
