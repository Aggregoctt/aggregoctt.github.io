excerpt: '<p><img alt="Reddit thread that reads, &quot;My niece got this question
  wrong in math class today, with the &quot;correct&quot; answer being 6. I&#039;m
  trying to explain to her that she was in fact correct and that the teacher was incorrect,
  but I don&#039;t know what the question was trying to ask. The teacher explained
  that the base of the pyramid could be broken down into 6 rectangles, which wasn&#039;t
  satisfying to myself or my niece. What do you guys think?&quot;" class="attachment-post-thumbnail

  <p>A fifth-grader’s math question sparked family drama over what seemed like a simple
  geometry problem.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>When Redditor u/Awecalibur reviewed his niece’s <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/math/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">math </a>homework, he wasn’t expecting
  to spark a family debate, let alone an internet one. But the fifth-grade math problem
  in question was anything but straightforward. It asked: "How many rectangular faces
  does a hexagonal pyramid have?"</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>OP’s niece answered confidently: 0. Her teacher, however, marked it wrong, insisting
  the correct answer was 6. This disagreement quickly spiraled into what u/Awecalibur
  <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/5th-grader-confusing-math-problem-2072235" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">described to <em>Newsweek</em></a> as a "heated conversation"
  among family members. But instead of letting it go, he turned to <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/reddit/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, hoping to crowdsource the
  proper answer.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-redditors-weighed-in-on-the-puzzling-math-question">Redditors
  weighed in on the puzzling math question</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/comments/1kb4xkq/teacher_told_my_niece_that_the_correct_answer_is_6/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Reddit post</a>, u/Awecalibur explained,
  "My niece got this question wrong in math class today, with the ''correct'' answer
  being 6." But the reasoning behind the teacher’s answer didn’t sit well with him
  or fellow Redditors. According to the OP, the teacher explained that the hexagonal
  base could be broken into rectangles.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That logic didn’t fly with Reddit users. One commenter wrote, "That''s odd. With
  that logic, you could break those rectangles down into smaller ones, and on and
  on." u/Awecalibur agreed and replied, "This is exactly what my niece told the teacher.
  The teacher insisted that it couldn''t be broken down infinitely."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another Redditor chimed in, "This teacher, like many before, only knows what
  the book says. If the book is wrong they’d never know."</p>

  <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Reddit comment, text reads,
  &quot;A hexagonal pyramid has one hexagonal face and 6 triangular faces.


  A hexagonal prism has two hexagonal faces and 6 rectangular faces.


  My guess is that there''s a typo and the answer key has the answer &quot;6&quot;
  and was about one of the above. The teacher''s explanation is probably them just
  trying to reconcile the answer they have in the answer key with the question.&quot;"

  <p>The online response overwhelmingly sided with u/Awecalibur’s niece. Many praised
  her curiosity and courage to question an answer that didn’t seem right. One user
  even turned the moment into a life lesson: "This my little girl, is what it''s like
  to have a job with an assertive boss. You know you are right, but rather than acknowledge
  that when you point it out to them, they get defensive and make up more stuff."</p>

  <p>"My guess is the teacher was embarrassed about being wrong, and in typical bad-teacher
  fashion doubled down and tried to explain away her fault, and failed miserably,"
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/comments/1kb4xkq/comment/mpsborr/" rel="noreferrer

  <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Reddit comment, text reads,
  &quot;Teacher is just incorrect, plain and simple.


  The teacher''s explanation makes no sense whatsoever. If it had asked ''hexagonal
  prism'' it would be 6 - the two bases would be hexagons and the six sides would
  be rectangles. But a hexagonal pyramid has one hexagonal base and 6 triangular sides.
