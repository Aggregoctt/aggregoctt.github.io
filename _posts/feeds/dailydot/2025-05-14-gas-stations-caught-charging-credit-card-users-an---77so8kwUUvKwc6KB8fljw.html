  <p>A Florida man issued a warning about using credit cards at gas pumps after being
  shocked by the surcharge for not paying with cash.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>There has always been an additional cost associated with using cards while filling
  up.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to the <a href="https://www.convenience.org/Advocacy/Issues/Swipe-Fees-and-Payments">Association
  for Convenience and Petroleum Retailing</a> (NACS), the reason is that credit card
  companies typically take about 2.5 percent of each card transaction.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, it seems the surcharge may have increased.</p>

  <p>According to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/number-want-gas-stations-charging-170000929.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9odWIubWFyZmVlbC5jb20v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAF1GT6LVHAPCIh3L87u8cY9QgMkdN0uy-Vw9zYR1OSlqNyFyWp01IYx4UhZVIMftCoA6ZWQhrqvQXje9mgg_Y2CgxzI5ZCWpLdibj9MiuRnLkf8D5YYIg0ru4irmsIjMF6bMRl8Y8C8hISIWXSN2puWmTKCAJI3AleVu_-PiOKAk">Yahoo
  Finance</a>!, Pat Igo, owner of North County Cooling, made a shocking discovery
  when he stopped at a Florida gas station to fill up one of his trucks.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>He noticed a sign stating that customers using a credit card would be charged
  $1 more per gallon.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

  <p>Curious, he asked the station manager if the sign was a mistake.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“And he said no,” Igo reportedly said. “‘I can make it any number I want.’ So
  I walked out.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In many states, it is legal for companies to impose surcharges on customers who
  pay with credit cards.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In Florida, that charge could be any amount once consumers are informed about
  it before making a purchase.</p>

  <p>After a local reporter investigated Igo''s claims, they checked out.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The reporter also found that several local gas stations were charging an additional
  dollar per gallon on credit card transactions.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In response to the investigation, two stations reduced their charges to 90 cents
  per gallon instead of a dollar.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>For Pat Igo, that reduction simply wasn''t enough. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He put his employees on the look out for gas stations with these extra charges
  to avoid them completely.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He also believes consumers should be better protected.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“There should be a law showing what they’re going to charge you if you use a
  credit card,” he said.</p>
