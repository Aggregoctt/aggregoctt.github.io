  <p>On Tuesday, reality star and business mogul <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/kim-kardashian/">Kim
  Kardashian</a> testified against 10 men who are suspected of robbing her in her
  hotel in France in 2016. Spectators said that her accessories sent a bold message
  to the defendants.</p>

  <p>Kardashian wore an all black blazer and pencil skirt. But onlookers were drawn
  to one piece of her outfit: her jewelry.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Most noticeably, she wore a 52.17 carat-total diamond and 18K white gold necklace
  that cost a shocking $1.5 million. She also sported an $8,100 diamond ear cuff and
  several pieces of Repossi jewelry.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While Kardashian is known for donning expensive outfits and jewelry, some believe
  that she wore the bold jewelry to send a message to the men who allegedly held her
  at gunpoint and robbed her of $9 million in jewelry in her Paris hotel nearly a
  decade prior.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“After I was robbed in Paris, I haven’t bought jewelry,” Kardashian <a href="https://people.com/kim-kardashian-says-she-hasnt-bought-jewelry-since-2016-paris-robbery-7550415">said
  back in 2023</a>. “I haven’t really been about wearing jewelry, because when it
  was taken from me—I didn’t know I was ready for that experience of what that meant
  but I was—I was ready to give it up.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Laura Taylor, a jewelry expert, <a href="https://people.com/kim-kardashian-wears-diamonds-to-testify-in-paris-robbery-trial-11733953">told
  <em>PEOPLE</em></a> she believes Kardashian''s outfit choice was "intentional" and
  sent a clear message to the men she testified against.</p>
