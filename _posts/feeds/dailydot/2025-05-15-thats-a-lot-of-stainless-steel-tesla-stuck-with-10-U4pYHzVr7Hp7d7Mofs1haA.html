  <p><strong>Tesla</strong> is sitting on a big stainless-steel problem.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The company reportedly has around <strong>10,000 Cybertrucks</strong> collecting
  dust in inventory—worth about <strong>$800 million total</strong>.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Despite all the hype surrounding the vehicle’s launch, it looks like demand just
  <a href="https://newatlas.com/automotive/tesla-cybertruck-has-bombed/">isn’t keeping
  up</a>.</p>

  Tesla overstocked?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/tesla/">Tesla</a> has been dialing back
  production due to slower-than-expected sales, which means the current overflow likely
  isn’t about ramping up production. It''s more likely to discount the vehicles and
  expose how much unsold inventory Tesla has on hand.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Many of the <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/cybertruck/">trucks</a> were
  built in 2024, so they’re already at least four months old. In some cases, even
  older.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Tesla still has ‘Foundation Series’ Cybertrucks in inventory—despite stopping
  production of those back in October 2024, more than seven months ago.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another sign that demand may not be where Tesla hoped? The rear-wheel drive (RWD)
  version uses the same battery pack as the all-wheel drive (AWD) version.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That’s generally a hint that Tesla didn’t see enough volume to justify producing
  multiple battery options—something they also did with the Model S and X when demand
  dropped following the launch of the more affordable Model 3 and Y.</p>

  <p>Over on <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/reddit/">Reddit’s</a> r/technology
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1kltk9s/tesla_reportedly_has_800_million_worth_of/">subreddit</a>,
  commenters were quick to poke fun at Tesla’s growing pile of unused Cybertrucks.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“That should add at least 5% to the stock by tomorrow AM,” one person joked.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“You get a new Cybertruck police cruiser. You get a Cybertruck police cruiser.
  Everybody gets a Cybertruck police cruiser!!” another joked.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A third chimed in, “The government will end up buying them.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“That’s a lot of stainless steel,” offered a fourth commenter. “How many DeLoreans
  can we make out of this?”&nbsp;</p>
