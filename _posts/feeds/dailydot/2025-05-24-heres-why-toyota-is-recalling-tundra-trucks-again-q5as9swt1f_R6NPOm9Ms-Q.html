  <p>This is not a false alarm. Toyota just <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-news/toyota-recalls-443000-tundra-trucks-over-reverse-lights/">announced
  a recall</a> that impacts more than 440,000 Tundra trucks due to an issue with certain
  models’ reverse lights.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Tundra owners with pickups from model years 2022-2025 should be aware of this
  news. Apparently, the issue is that outside moisture can fry the trucks’ reverse
  lights. That is obviously an incredibly dangerous situation for any driver.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>So of course Toyota is taking care of the issue. If you’re affected, go ahead
  and visit a dealership to get your new (and better-designed) reverse lamps installed
  free of charge. Additionally, the dealership will take care of any water damage
  already done to the truck.</p>

  <p>This is by no means the first time Toyota has issued a recall. In August, the
  manufacturer <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/toyota-highlander-2024-recall-warning/">announced
  an issue</a> with the Grand Highlander’s airbags. That recall affected more than
  145,000 vehicles in model year 2024. Just last week, a Camry owner <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/toyota-camry-water-leaking-trunk/">reported
  a similar issue</a> in her vehicle.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another 100,000 Tundras were recalled last summer due to possible failure of
  its <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/toyota-v6-turbo-recall/">3.5-liter twin-turbo
  V6 engine.</a> </p>

  <p>According to <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/car-recalls-defects/car-recall-guide-your-questions-answered-a1115780728/">Consumer
  Reports</a>, news of car recalls isn’t necessarily a bad thing. They give manufacturers
  a chance to remedy issues and make cars out on the road safer. It’s scarier to think
  about design flaws that go unnoticed and unaddressed.</p>
