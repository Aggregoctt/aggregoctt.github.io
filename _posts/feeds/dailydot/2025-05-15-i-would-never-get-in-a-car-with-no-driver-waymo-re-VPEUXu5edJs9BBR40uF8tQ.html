  <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced the <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/waymo/">Waymo</a>
  recall in a statement.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The recall followed 16 crashes into structures like gates, chains, and road barriers
  between 2022 and 2024. Vehicles with the company''s fifth-generation software were
  impacted by the recall.</p>

  <p>According to Waymo, these crashes did not cause injury to any passengers. In
  response to the recall, Waymo issued a sixth-generation software update for all
  impacted vehicles. The update went into effect in December 2024, per a report by
  <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/waymo-recalls-vehicles/3868378/">NBC
  Bay Area News</a>. </p>

  <p>Other driverless taxi companies reported similar issues. The Daily Dot <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/amazon-zoox-recall-las-vegas/">recently
  reported</a> that Amazon recalled driverless taxi software Zoox after a crash.</p>

  <p>Several former passengers have voiced concerns about the safety of the Google-owned
  driverless taxi service. In <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/waymo-driverless-vehicle-dangers/">a
  previous report</a> by the Daily Dot, one passenger said their Waymo drove past
  them during pickup. Later, the vehicle wouldn''t let them out when it suddenly stopped
  moving on the highway. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another TikToker filmed a Waymo taking an unprotected left turn into oncoming
  traffic, sparking debate about the company''s software to monitor the roads. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In the comments, viewers expressed their skepticism about the safety of driverless
  taxis.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Never getting in a Waymo. I’d rather call my ex to pick me up," one wrote.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I will never drive in an automated ride share vehicle," another said.</p>

  <p>"You waymo brave than me cause I would never get in a car with no driver lol,"
  a third joked.</p>
