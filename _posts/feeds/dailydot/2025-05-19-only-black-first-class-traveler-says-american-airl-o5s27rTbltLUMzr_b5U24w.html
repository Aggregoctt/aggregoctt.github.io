  <p>A Black travel influencer is going viral after posting a TikTok alleging she
  was the only first-class passenger on an American Airlines flight who wasn''t served
  a meal. In a TikTok that has been viewed over 4.9 million times, the influencer
  says she was given just a cup of coffee, while fellow passengers dined around her.
  She has since posted updates addressing the discourse and backlash and standing
  by her experience, which she called "humiliating."</p>

  <p>The influencer, who goes by @johbidoo_official on TikTok, has over 540K followers
  on TikTok and 223K on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/johbidoo_official/?hl=en"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Instagram</a>. She regularly posts travel
  and lifestyle-related content and was on a domestic flight from Boston to Miami
  when the incident happened.</p>

  does @johbidoo_official''s video show?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The first video, which has been viewed more than 4.9M times, shows the influencer
  sitting in her first-class seat, with a cup of coffee on an empty table, while others
  around her eat. Text on the video reads, “When u the only black person in first
  class and the food apparently ran out… Well thank u <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/american-airlines/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">American Airlines</a>”, along with the
  caption, “MAKE IT MAKE SENSE.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Commenters were enraged by what they were seeing. “Flight attendant here, they
  were provided with enough meals. They didn’t run out!!” one user said. Another added
  that this was a “blessing in disguise”, and “May your lawsuit check be PLENTIFUL.”
  Others shared their own experiences of racism while traveling. “This literally happened
  to my black boyfriend on American Airlines too - 3 years ago,” one user, Liv, said.
  “I’ve noticed some flight attendants catch an attitude as soon as they see me,”
  added user Estelle. “Also, if they see I’m struggling with my bag they’ll look away
  but they’ll help others put their bag up.”</p>

  <p>However, not everyone was on board with some accusing Johbidoo of making it up.
  Some users were also quick to note the seats didn’t seem as premium as their price
  suggested. “These seats don''t even look first class,” Magnolia 10 commented.</p>
