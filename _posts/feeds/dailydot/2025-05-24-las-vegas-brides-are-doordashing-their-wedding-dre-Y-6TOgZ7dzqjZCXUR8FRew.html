  last-minute brides can now get their perfect dress delivered to them in under an

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-david-s-bridal-dresses-delivered-by-doordash">David''s
  Bridal dresses delivered by DoorDash</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The bridal boutique has been around for 75 years, but it’s clearly keeping up
  with the times.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Through the partnership, brides-to-be in 180 locations nationwide can now have
  their dresses delivered to them.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Over 2,000 dresses have already been delivered. Unsurprisingly, a large share
  of those orders came out of Las Vegas—a city synonymous with spontaneous weddings
  and last-minute elopements.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The move taps into a growing demand for convenience and flexibility. It also
  shows how even the most traditional retailers are adapting to the on-demand economy.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Brides, bridesmaids and special occasion shoppers across the U.S. can now access
  an assortment of gorgeous dresses, shoes and accessories and enjoy delivery to their
  door step," a press release issued by <a href="https://www.newswire.com/news/david-s-bridal-taps-doordash-for-on-demand-delivery-partnership-22478364">DoorDash</a>
  explained back in December 2024.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The release also explained how the service will make shopping for a wedding dress
  much less stressful.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>It explained shoppers "will have quick and easy access to everything they need
  with a few taps of a button, to make every occasion special, take the stress out
  of the wedding and event planning process or solve last-minute snafus."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-speedy-dress-delivery-at-the-same-price">Speedy
  dress delivery at the same price</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The press release also explained the partnership and service will not impact
  the cost of the dresses.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>It assured that the store will sell items "all at the same incredible retail
  price as in-store."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The service plans to tap into a market of customers who need dresses but don''t
  have a lot of time to shop.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Kelly Cook, David''s Bridal CEO, these women deserve to be served.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/luxury-davids-bridal-diamonds-and-pearls/">CBS
  MoneyWatch</a>, Cook said this month that approximately 17% of David''s brides are
  looking for dresses for weddings that are less than three weeks away. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"So we have to serve the last-minute brides," Cook said, per the outlet.</p>
