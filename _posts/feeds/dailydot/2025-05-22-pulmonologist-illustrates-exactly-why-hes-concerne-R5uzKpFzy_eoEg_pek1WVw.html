  <p>A pulmonologist went viral after revealing that AI might outperform him at reading
  X-rays. It''s spreading concern over doctors being replaced with artificial intelligence.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a TikTok video, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.fawzikatranji" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">@dr.fawzikatranji</a>, a seasoned pulmonologist, showed
  a comparison of a patient’s chest X-ray followed by an AI-analyzed version. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He said, "So I''m about to lose my job. And this is scary because I developed
  a skill over 20 years." He narrated how he could instantly identify patterns in
  an X-ray.</p>

  <p>He said of the example X-ray, "We have right middle lobe pneumonia, maybe left
  upper lobe consolidation. Patient is very sick. She has bilateral pneumonia. We
  need to take care of her."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, AI’s rapid and accurate read shook him. "Here comes AI," the doctor
  said, "and of course, they pick it up in a second." </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AI identifying pneumonia on

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The AI flagged pneumonia almost instantly, leaving the doctor wondering aloud
  about his future. "So now you don''t need professional eyes to look at these X-rays...
  I’m gonna be applying to McDonald''s soon. I hope they have some openings."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The humorous <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/tiktok/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">TikTok</a> sign-off didn’t entirely mask the concern.
  His fear is rooted in the idea that machines might soon render a crucial part of
  his diagnostic role obsolete. Although medical professionals often adapt to new
  technologies, @dr.fawzikatranji''s tone struck a chord with many who feel uncertain
  about AI''s accelerating role in health care.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-all-doctors-are-worried-about-ai-taking-their-jobs">Not
  all doctors are worried about AI taking their jobs</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Shortly after the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1kqgrei/pulmonologist_illustrates_why_he_is_now_concerned/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">video surfaced</a> on <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/reddit/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, another pulmonologist offered
  a more optimistic perspective. "I’m a Pulmonologist and I’m not scared at all for
  my job," the commenter wrote. They pointed out that interpreting chest X-rays is
  only a small part of the job. "It’s to treat the patient," they added.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Moreover, the commenter suggested that <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/ai/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AI could act</a> as a valuable second
  opinion rather than a threat. "Accurate AI reads of these imaging will make his
  job easier... it’ll give him more confidence that he’s doing the right thing."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This more measured view suggests that while AI might speed up diagnostics, it
  still lacks the human touch required to treat and manage complex conditions. Importantly,
  <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/doctors/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">doctors</a>
  still need to assess symptoms, explain diagnoses, and offer treatment plans tailored
  to each individual, which is a skill AI hasn’t mastered.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"While it might suck for some medical workers, hospitals having the ability to
  run quick check-ups like this on patients could save sooo many lives in the future,"
  another Redditor noted.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Even so, the pulmonologist’s reaction serves as a reminder of the emotional toll
  these innovations can bring.</p>
