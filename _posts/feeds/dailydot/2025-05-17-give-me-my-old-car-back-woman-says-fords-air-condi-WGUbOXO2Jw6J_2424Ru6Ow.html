  <p>Most <strong>car buyers</strong> wish that the experience of <strong>purchasing
  a vehicle</strong> would be as simple as going into a <strong>dealership</strong>,
  choosing the car you’d like, making a payment, then driving off the lot.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. Car dealerships employ <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/car-salesman-illegal-sales-tactic/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">all sorts of tactics</a> to get you to
  pay more money than you were expecting, and even if one manages to get a car off
  the lot without breaking the bank, there’s always a possibility that <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/carvana-ford-mustang/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">something about the car was misrepresented</a>—or
  that <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/man-buys-120k-chevrolet-from-dealership/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">something will go awry with the vehicle</a>
  soon after it enters their possession.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In this woman’s case, problems began before she even fully owned the car. Despite
  this, she claims that the dealership is still trying to make her pay for it.</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-went-wrong-with-this-woman-s-car-purchase"><strong>What
  went wrong with this woman’s car purchase?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In a video with over 33,000 views, TikTok user Kaelyn (@kaelyng23) explains how
  her new car came with a bill for $1,300.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to Kaelyn, she went to a Ford dealership on a Saturday with the intention
  of buying a car. When she was there, she says she was told that she could test drive
  a car until Tuesday, but to do so, she would have to sign to get “pre-approved”
  for a loan. If she decided to keep the car, she claims she was told, the financing
  would kick in. If not, she could simply return the car.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Satisfied, she left her trade-in with the dealership, though she says she never
  signed it over.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While everything seemed fine at first, she says that soon after she began driving
  the car, the air conditioner stopped working.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-broken-a-c-on-a-test-drive">A broken A/C on
  a test drive</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“So I emailed them, I texted them, everything, telling them,” she recounts. “They''re
  like, ‘OK, bring it in Monday when we''re open.’”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>On Monday, Kaelyn brought the car in, only to be told that the car required $1,300
  in repairs—and that she was on the hook to pay it, despite, in her view, not actually
  owning the car.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“I said ‘No,’” Kaelyn recalls. “I said, ‘Give me my old car back, because I am
  not paying for a car that I haven''t even bought.’”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“And he''s like, ‘Well, you have a loan on it,’” Kaelyn continues. “I''m like,
  ‘No, you''ve made me get pre-approved so I could take it home this weekend, and
  you said you are not going to submit it to the bank unless I don''t bring the car
  back.’”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Kaelyn then insisted that she get her old car back, only to be told that “that’s
  not how it works.”&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“They''re basically just holding my car hostage, I guess,” she details. She also
  states, “I don''t even want the car now, and I''m wondering how to just get my old
  car back.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-her-rights"><strong>What are her rights?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>One cannot be sure about Kaelyn’s rights in this situation without viewing her
  specific contract.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>However, if her story is accurate, it appears that Kaelyn did sign an agreement
  to purchase the car, only under false pretenses. If she cannot work out the situation
  with the dealership, many commenters recommended that she report them to the Better
  Business Bureau and that she consult legal counsel regarding a potential claim against
  the dealership.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>For the time being, if Kaelyn did not sign the title of her trade-in vehicle,
  the dealership does not have legal ownership of her trade-in vehicle. Holding her
  vehicle without a proper title transfer <a href="https://www.greenlightautocredit.com/faqs/can-you-trade-in-a-car-with-no-title/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">could be considered illegal</a>, depending
  on the specific situation, as without the title, the vehicle is still technically
  owned by Kaelyn.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Regardless, Kaelyn says the dealership <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kaelyng23/video/7504036694237269279"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">“completely lied”</a> to her and that
  they have admitted to doing so in subsequent conversations, giving her a potential
  case against them should she choose to pursue legal action.</p>

  <p>While Kaelyn appears to believe that the car is simply in her possession now
  and that there’s nothing she can do about it, commenters encouraged her to go further
  in resolving the situation, perhaps bringing in legal counsel to prevent the dealership
  from causing any further issues.</p>

  <p>“Bring the cops in to get your car back,” wrote a user.</p>

  <p>“Call you state’s Dept of Motor Vehicles. Leave this car there,” suggested a
