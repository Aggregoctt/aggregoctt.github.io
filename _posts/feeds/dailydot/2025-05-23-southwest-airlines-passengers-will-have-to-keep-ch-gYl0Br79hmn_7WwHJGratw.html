  <p>Beware, Southwest Airlines travelers: You''re going to have to keep your <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5406294/southwest-airlines-will-require-passengers-to-keep-chargers-visible-due-to-fire-risk">portable
  charging devices</a> visible during flights.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Southwest announced the changes in a statement earlier in the week. The new safety
  measure should allow for flight attendants to address any fires that break out mid-flight
  quickly.</p>

  <p>Well, if you’re using a power bank or another portable charging device, you''ll
  have to keep it out of your bag and visible to the crew during the flight. No more
  leaving it in your dufflel bag in the overhead bin.</p>

  <p>This might seem like an overreaction on the part of the airline, but there is
  a good reason for this policy change. The flammability of lithium-ion batteries
  is well-known, as they power many of the personal devices we carry around. This
  year, the Federal Aviation Administration has already seen more than 20 lithium-ion
  battery-related fires on U.S. flights.</p>

  <p>A faulty power bank stored in an overhead compartment is likely the cause of
  a January Air Busan <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3n25rdr3lo">plane
  fire</a> that occurred in South Korea. Thankfully, just three people were injured
  in that accident.</p>

  <p>Several airlines in South Korea already <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airlines-that-have-updated-their-lithium-battery-policies-2025-03-14/">made
  this change</a> in response to the tragedy.</p>
