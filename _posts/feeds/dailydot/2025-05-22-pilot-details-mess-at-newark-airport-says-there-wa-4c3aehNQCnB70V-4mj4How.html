  <p>Construction, technical issues, and air traffic controller shortages at Newark
  Liberty International Airport have caused delayed and canceled flights. One Newark
  pilot documented his experience taking off in a now-viral TikTok.</p>

  at Newark Airport?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Pilot and TikToker Peter Cappio (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pilotpete.fly">@pilotpete.fly</a>),
  who previously appeared on ABC''s <em>The Bachelorette</em>, said he had to wait
  behind 26 other planes on the runway on Wednesday.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>He explained that the two major runways at the airport were closed for construction.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/faa/">Federal Aviation
  Administration</a> (FAA), flights departing from Newark were capped at 28 starting
  May 20. This is due to a combination of factors: technical issues, an air traffic
  controller shortage, and ongoing construction. This reduction will continue until
  June 15.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Every plane has to take off and land on the parallel runway," he said <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pilotpete.fly/video/7506877504892701995">in
  the clip</a>. "It caused a backup bigger than I''ve ever seen at Newark."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Cappio claimed it took his flight 57 minutes from pushback to takeoff.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Despite the delay, Cappio praised the air traffic controllers. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Super skilled getting airplanes airborne as quickly as possible while dealing
  with airplanes coming in to land," he said.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>His praise comes after a series of radar and communications outages. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The first two of the four in a matter of just three weeks occurred on April 28
  and May 9. Those <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/us/travel/newark-liberty-airport-outage-faa-air-traffic-control-b2754584.html">reportedly</a>
  lasted for up to 90 seconds. The outages left air traffic controllers <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/culture/pilot-explains-whats-going-on-at-newark-airport-right-now/">unable
  to communicate with airplanes</a> in the sky. The latest and fourth outage occurred
  on May 20. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The outages have prompted widespread skepticism of safety at Newark Airport.</p>
