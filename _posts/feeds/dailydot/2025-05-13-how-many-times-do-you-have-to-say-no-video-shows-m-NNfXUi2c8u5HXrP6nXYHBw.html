  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A viral TikTok is forcing women to rehash a familiar conversation about male
  entitlement after two men refused to take "no" for an answer at a brewery.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Jam (@hotweirdgirl69) started recording after two strange men sat down at the
  table she was sharing with her friend. She captioned her video, which has been viewed
  over 4.3 million times, "How many times do you have to say no to a man." Based on
  how this particular encounter went, the answer is a ridiculously high number of
  times.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Jam started off fairly polite, keeping the tone light as she referred to their
  spot as a "girls only table" and told the men that she was "respectfully asking
  you to go to another table."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>When that didn’t suffice, she turned the camera around to film them—and to show
  just how much space was available in the brewery. Multiple tables were completely
  free, and plenty of others had partial space, just as the one she was sharing with
  her friend.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But no matter what they said to the two men, they mostly just stared at the women
  blankly, as if they couldn’t believe they were being asked to move or thought the
  whole thing was just some big joke.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Over the course of the one minute and seven seconds Jam was recording, she tried
  being polite, telling them it was weird, suggesting other places they could sit,
  threatening to spill one of the men’s drink, telling them both she and her friend
  were already in relationships, and, when none of that worked, literally screaming
  for them to leave.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"I guess we’ll go then," she said near the end. "You want our table? We’ll f**king
  go."</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Although it was nearly impossible to hear anything the men said during the video,
  commenters immediately jumped to the conclusion that this had nothing to do with
  the actual table and everything to do with these guys feeling entitled to harass
  women who had repeatedly made it clear they were not interested.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Jam ultimately confirmed what everyone already knew in a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hotweirdgirl69/video/7503647472711896362">follow-up
  video</a>, telling viewers that one of the men kept saying his brother was interested
  in her friend.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"Why the heck are you sitting down when there’s like, a million different tables?"
  she wondered. "I guess it’s not criminal. They didn’t do anything physical. But
  it was weird. There’s no doubt it was weird and it deserved to be recorded, because
  you never know how things like that are going to escalate."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She also explained that the brewery was loud enough that she didn’t think any
  of the people around them could actually hear what was going on, which explains
  why nobody stepped in. And even though it looked as if the two men might finally
  leave by the end of the video, Jam said she and her friend were the ones who abandoned
  the table and went upstairs to finish their food before calling it a night.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"They did get up and it looked like they were going to follow us, but I got up
  pretty quick to leave," she said. "So I didn’t really give them the opportunity
  to follow us. So yeah, it was weird."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But the fact that it got to that point left viewers frustrated—especially those
  who have found themselves in similar situations with random men who just don’t seem
  to grasp the idea that what they want isn’t the single most important factor during
  interactions with strangers.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>"''just stand up and leave'' why is it always us? why is it always OUR peace
  that gets disturbed? why is it always us that have to do something? THEY invade
  our space, they should be the ones going away," @beatricescrive_ complained.</p>
