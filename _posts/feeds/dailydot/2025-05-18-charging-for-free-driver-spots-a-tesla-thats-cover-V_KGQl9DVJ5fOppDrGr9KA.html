  <p>Could solar panels outfitting your electric vehicle make it self-reliant? Well,
  one driver tried it out.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>A woman named Sandra (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sandraaaa096">@sandraaaa096</a>
  on TikTok) saw a <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/tesla-10k-unsold-cybertrucks/">Tesla</a>
  out on the road with solar panels strapped to it. The strips of sun-absorbent material
  were outfitted to all four of the vehicle''s doors. Furthermore, the entirety of
  its panoramic glass roof, along with its trunk, was also covered in panels.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>She recorded footage of the <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/tesla-home-charger-bill/">EV</a>
  driving around with the unusual sighting and uploaded it to her TikTok account.
  The video accrued over 580,000 views, along with hundreds of comments. Many penned
  that they were equally mortified by the sight. However,  some pondered the efficacy
  of such a rig on the electric vehicle.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Kara quips in a text overlay of the video, "The economy is so bad Teslas got
  solar panels strapped on."</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>One user on the application thought it was a brilliant idea. They said that Tesla
  should equip every car in its lineup with solar tech. "Honestly how all Tesla should''ve
  been built. Solar panels in roof. Would never have to charge it again. Smart man,"
  the commenter wrote.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Someone else agreed. They speculated that leaving the car parked outdoors with
  this solar arrangement would contribute significantly to their car''s battery.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Another user on the application pointed out that Tesla already offers solar panel
  products. So why not outfit a car with similar technology? "Tesla makes solar systems
  roofs/walls so why don’t they build them into the bodies of their vehicles?" they
  suggested.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-you-solar-charge-a-tesla">Can you solar-charge
  a Tesla?</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Using just the power of the sun to charge an electric vehicle could take a lot
  of time. This is not only due to the sheer amount of energy it takes to power the
  lithium-ion batteries in these cars. Additionally, charging speed is another concern.
  Currently, there are three primary charging velocities that EVs utilize.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Level 1 charging typically refers to standard, 12-volt plug outputs. Typically,
  these are fine for powering a mobile device such as a phone or tablet. Furthermore,
  other consumer electronics such as computers, TV sets, sound systems, kitchen appliances,
  lights, etc., use these outlets.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>When it comes to size, it''s helpful to understand nomenclature regarding battery
  technology. Specifically, amp hours. For instance, take smartphone batteries. The
  iPhone 16 Pro Max is packing a 4,685 milliamph-hour unit. Conversely, a 2018 Tesla
  Model 3 has a 150 amp-hour capacity, or 150,000 amp hours. Which means it will take
  around 32 times the amount of time to fully charge a Tesla Model 3 from zero than
  this particular iPhone model.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>So with a level 1 charger, it''ll take a Tesla owner several days to fully charge
  their battery. As per this <a href="https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/level-1-charging-speed.305045/">Tesla
  Motors Club</a> forum post, standard charging only adds around 2-3 miles per hour
  of charging. If you primarily use an EV to commute to and from work, leaving it
  plugged in on a standard charger can help. And if you have access to an outlet at
  work, it could be helpful, depending on your driving habits.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faster-than-solar">Faster than solar</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But for drivers who use their car for more than short-distance driving, higher
  levels of charging are necessary. But this greater power distribution and threshold
  come with some stipulations. A traditional three-pronged 12-volt outlet isn''t going
  to cut it. Level 2 chargers require <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askanelectrician/comments/10bc4kj/plugging_electric_washerdryer_into_a_nema_1450/">NEMA
  14-50</a> outlets, the same type you''d find necessary to power some washers and
  dryers.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>These level 2 chargers are capable of fully charging a Tesla, depending on its
  battery capacity, between 9-12 hours. Outfitting one''s home with a level 2 charger
  necessitates a <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/tesla-home-charger-bill/">NEMA
  14-50 outlet</a>. If you don''t have access to at-home charging, then EV fill-ups
  can be costly.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Different businesses and charging companies set pricing for their plugs at varying
  rates. This can, in some instances, amount to more than it would cost to fill up
  a car with gasoline. Again, this is all contingent on the fuel efficiency of a vehicle
  and what the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2021/10/23/costs-charge-ev-fuel-car-gas-study/6154204001/">EV
  charging rates are</a>.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tesla-charging">Tesla charging</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>If you have an energy provider with reasonable rates, you''ll probably want at-home
  level 2 charging. There are also vehicles capable of level-3 fast charging. Teslas,
  for instance, have a wide supercharger network. <a href="https://www.fool.com/research/tesla-supercharger-stations/">The
  Motley Fool</a> writes that as of 2025, there are over 29,000 Tesla supercharger
  posts available in the United States.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>This gives Tesla the largest level 3 charging network in the world. The auto
  manufacturer has also opened up its superchargers to be used by other EV brands
  for fast charging capabilities. Oftentimes, these require ports. However, Tesla''s
  plug, also known as the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ev-charging-adapters">North
  American Charging Standard (NACS)</a>, is also being adopted by other <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/features/tesla-nacs-charging-port-automaker-compatibility">car
  makers</a>.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterlyon/2025/05/15/mazda-bites-bullet-and-adopts-teslas-superchargers-globally/">Mazda</a>,
  which has barely dipped its toes into the EV game, announced that future vehicles
  would be outfitted with NACS plugs.</p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-solar-panel-speed">Solar panel speed</h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>So, how practical is it to charge an EV using just solar panels? </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><a href="https://www.solar.com/learn/how-many-solar-panels-does-it-take-to-fuel-an-electric-car/">Solar.com</a>
  did the math, and it seems like the Tesla owner in the video may''ve read the article.
  The outlet states it would take 4.5 hours of direct sunlight across 6 separate panels
  for 37 miles of driving.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Of course, this number is predicated on numerous factors. If you accelerate quickly
  and use a lot of in-car electronics, that could diminish your speed. Other factors,
  like cold weather, could also inhibit how much charge your battery holds. The outlet
  did a comparison with a Toyota RAV4 EV to compare the Japanese brand''s efficiency
  with Tesla offerings.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The American auto maker, when it comes to battery and all-electric optimization,
  held the advantage according to the website. If you have an EV and you''re thinking
  about going the solar panel charging route, there are several factors to consider.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>First, is the rig itself and ensuring your car''s parked in a spot where it won''t
  get stolen. Secondly, the panel will need to be connected to your Tesla charging
  cable while it''s parked. So again, security is paramount—it''s <a href="https://links.duckduckgo.com/m.js?dsl=1&amp;iurl=%7B1%7DIG%3D165B29C8AAD1472991BBE3AF4386BD86%26CID%3D3566DAFF06EA67CB2902CF12072D662A%26ID%3DDevEx%2C5193.1&amp;ivu=%7B4%7Dtype%3Dmv%26reqver%3D1.0%26rg%3D6ac3ad65c2704076bb978bbaa7830559&amp;sfexp=0&amp;shopping=1&amp;spld=%7B%22ld%22%3A%22e8KklVaHHJexGglNA1eWsgXTVUCUxeBS0PmkDcBVvGksKfDe4vd2hm810OMMbVdQ4N9bViVqZhz-bcwN-XDntI-8vpGAIWQkIpH_qYf35Y4B2Za9xxpVOf706FhuBouZYOB4JQe4Bprbx9AiTz8wbN7__uwgxBK3smat4_KrClE6gzT-ra8Zd0iISewOlSBI15T184mg%22%2C%22rlid%22%3A%223ae90607b93212dba2df6e21e83768ef%22%2C%22u%22%3A%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%22%7D&amp;styp=entitydetails&amp;ad_domain=www.ebay.com&amp;click_metadata=-XhFWK5UVyuXoyrR5xnvFkrvZ8piftThwgAJf2D-aSM.TYGUvLS98CNaPwpdyIeZxg">not

  <p>While the panels on the Tesla in Sandra''s video look fairly secure, there are
  other options folks can explore. There are businesses that offer roof-mounted solar
  panels. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>And if you can find a shop that knows how to work on Teslas, they may be able
  to rewire the car so that the solar energy is constantly being fed into the battery.
  Or, at the very least, initiates in drawing power from the panels while it drives.</p>

So again, security is paramount&#8212;it&#8217;s <a href="https://links.duckduckgo.com/m.js?dsl=1&amp;iurl=%7B1%7DIG%3D165B29C8AAD1472991BBE3AF4386BD86%26CID%3D3566DAFF06EA67CB2902CF12072D662A%26ID%3DDevEx%2C5193.1&amp;ivu=%7B4%7Dtype%3Dmv%26reqver%3D1.0%26rg%3D6ac3ad65c2704076bb978bbaa7830559&amp;sfexp=0&amp;shopping=1&amp;spld=%7B%22ld%22%3A%22e8KklVaHHJexGglNA1eWsgXTVUCUxeBS0PmkDcBVvGksKfDe4vd2hm810OMMbVdQ4N9bViVqZhz-bcwN-XDntI-8vpGAIWQkIpH_qYf35Y4B2Za9xxpVOf706FhuBouZYOB4JQe4Bprbx9AiTz8wbN7__uwgxBK3smat4_KrClE6gzT-ra8Zd0iISewOlSBI15T184mg%22%2C%22rlid%22%3A%223ae90607b93212dba2df6e21e83768ef%22%2C%22u%22%3A%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%22%7D&amp;styp=entitydetails&amp;ad_domain=www.ebay.com&amp;click_metadata=-XhFWK5UVyuXoyrR5xnvFkrvZ8piftThwgAJf2D-aSM.TYGUvLS98CNaPwpdyIeZxg">not like these cables come cheap</a>.</p>

  <p>But if you have an EV and can address the aforementioned concerns, solar charging could be the way to go.</p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@sandraaaa096/video/7503641973039861022">  <a target="_blank" title="@sandraaaa096" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sandraaaa096?refer=embed">@sandraaaa096</a> &#129315;&#129315;&#129315;  <a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed">#fyp</a> <a title="tesla" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tesla?refer=embed">#tesla</a> <a title="foryoupage" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryoupage?refer=embed">#foryoupage</a> <a title="fyppppppppppppppppppppppp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyppppppppppppppppppppppp?refer=embed">#fyppppppppppppppppppppppp</a> <a title="viral" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/viral?refer=embed">#viral</a> <a title="economy" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/economy?refer=embed">#economy</a> <a target="_blank" title="&#9836; suono originale - BRAINROT-77" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/suono-originale-7488877199404174102?refer=embed">&#9836; suono originale &#8211; BRAINROT-77</a>  </blockquote><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-other-mobile-solar-options">Other mobile solar options</h2><p>While the panels on the Tesla in Sandra&#8217;s video look fairly secure, there are other options folks can explore. There are businesses that offer roof-mounted solar panels. </p>

  <p>And if you can find a shop that knows how to work on Teslas, they may be able to rewire the car so that the solar energy is constantly being fed into the battery. Or, at the very least, initiates in drawing power from the panels while it drives.</p><p>The Daily Dot has reached out to Sandra via TikTok comment for further information. </p></div>
