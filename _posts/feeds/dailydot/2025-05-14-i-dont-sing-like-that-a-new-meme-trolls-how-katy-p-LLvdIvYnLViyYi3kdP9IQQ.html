  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Katy Perry has once again become the internet‚Äôs favorite meme: this time for
  the way she pronounces her lyrics. Her 2008 ballad "Thinking of You" recently went
  viral on TikTok, not for its emotional lyrics, but for her classic theatrical over-enunciation.
  </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Folks participating in the trend made parody videos of Perry''s exaggerated vocal
  delivery. They do this through over-acting and lip-sync videos to her original song
  recording. While many did it in jest, some fans couldn‚Äôt help but genuinely question
  her singing choices.</p>

  <p>The most-mocked line is, "You‚Äôre like an Indian summer in the middle of winter,
  like a hard candy with a surprise center." TikTokers leaned into the dramatic pauses
  and sharp syllables, pairing their performances with exaggerated facial expressions.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>This ironic trend sparked thousands of recreations, with viewers either laughing
  along or defending Perry‚Äôs signature style. One of the most common searches for
  the trend on TikTok is "<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/katy-perry/" rel="noreferrer

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Instead of ignoring the <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/tiktok-trends/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">trend</a>, Perry leaned into the moment
  during <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/culture/katy-perry-lifetimes-tour/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">the U.S. kickoff of her Lifetimes tour</a> on May 7, 2025.
  Folks recorded the moment and shared it on social media.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Perry addressed the crowd, saying cheekily, "I‚Äôm not going to do it," before
  launching into an over-emphasized rendition of the popular lip-sync verse, complete
  with facial expressions to match. After singing the line, "candy with a ‚Äî," she
  paused, looked at the crowd, and insisted, "I don‚Äôt sing like that," and didn''t
  finish the song. </p>

  <p>Many TikTok users have now come full circle with the trend, taking it one step
  further. They''re not just mocking Katy Perry‚Äôs over-enunciation: they''re now mocking
  her for mocking the trend itself. In a way, it‚Äôs become a parody of a parody, with
  creators layering the joke for even more absurdity. The result is a self-aware cycle
  of satire that highlights just how deeply internet culture loves to remix itself.</p>
