  <p>The internet is buzzing with style discourse after a string of viral TikTok videos
  reignited an old debate: is the style code broken? In cities across the U.S., straight
  men are leaning into "gay fashion" items like pastel colors and mesh tops, whereas
  gay men are embracing traditionally masculine looks like workwear and soccer jerseys.
  As style and fashion become increasingly fluid (particularly with each younger generation),
  the internet is having fun with it, while asking serious questions about what it
  means for identity when a visual shorthand for sexuality no longer applies.  </p>

  <p>On April 23, 2025, TikToker <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@notolsennchris"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">@notolsennchris</a> captured the internet’s
  attention with a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@notolsennchris/video/7496618504708246827"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">relatable plea</a>. He said, "If you live
  in a liberal city, we need to all get together and recalibrate our gaydars, because
  gays are looking straight and straights are looking gay. It''s getting hard to tell."
  His comment wasn’t just about <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/fashion/" rel="noreferrer
  noopener" target="_blank">fashion</a>, it was about the chaos of visual assumptions
  in a post-gender-norm world.</p>

  <p>In recent years, style once associated with <a href="https://www.putthison.com/straight-copying-how-gay-fashion-goes-mainstream/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">gay and queer culture</a> has made its

  and even pearl necklaces, which were once seen as bold or flamboyant, are now part
  of mainstream menswear. Although it’s a shift, it didn’t happen overnight.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Meanwhile, many gay men are veering toward aesthetics traditionally labeled "masculine."
  Inspired by construction-core, workwear, and a clean, minimalist vibe, these outfits
  favor function and grit; think Carhartt jackets, sports jerseys, and raw denim.</p>

  <p>This evolution isn’t about going back into the closet but rather indicates a
