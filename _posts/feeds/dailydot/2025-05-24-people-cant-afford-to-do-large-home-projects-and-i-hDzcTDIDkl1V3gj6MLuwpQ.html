  <p>Home improvement stores Lowe’s and Home Depot are sounding the alarm about the
  United States economy as both companies are seeing decreased shopping activity in-store.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>According to <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/retail/lowes-ceo-flags-alarming-trend-thats-hurting-sales"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the Street</a>, Lowe’s reported a drop
  in both sales year-over-year and the number of transactions. Home Depot also reported
  a dip in sales over the first four months of the year.</p>

  <p>Lowe’s and Home Depot leadership are blaming high mortgage rates for the numbers.
  If interest rates are high and homes aren’t selling, then people aren’t going to
  Home Depot and Lowe’s to buy the stuff they need to complete household projects.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said in May that homeowners are still doing small projects
  to keep their current homes in good repair. They’re not splurging on big home improvement
  projects at the moment.</p>

  <p>One potential way for both companies to remain competitive is to import fewer
  goods from China.</p>
