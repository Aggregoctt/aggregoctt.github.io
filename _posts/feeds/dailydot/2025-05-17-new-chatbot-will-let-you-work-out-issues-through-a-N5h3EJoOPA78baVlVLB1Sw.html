  <p>There’s now a chatbot for heartbreak caused by getting ghosted.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>It’s called <a href="https://closure.ink/">Closure</a>, and it lets users message
  an AI version of the person who ghosted them—whether that’s an ex, a friend, or
  even a recruiter—and supposedly get the closure they never got in real life.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  app works</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Closure is currently in open beta and launched on Product Hunt this week.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>You might’ve already seen it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/1kf03fb/an_ad_that_showed_up_in_my_feed_this_is_straight/#lightbox">advertised
  on Reddit</a>, with the tagline, “Thinking about your ex 24/7? There’s nothing wrong
  with you. Chat with their AI version—and finally let it go.”</p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Once you sign up, you choose the kind of relationship you want closure from.
  The options include long-distance partners, old friends, recruiters, dates, and
  family members.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>After that, the chatbot asks a few setup questions—like how you met, their age,
  and how things ended—so it can personalize the conversation and respond in a way
  that feels familiar.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>The idea is that by getting to say what you wish you could’ve said—and hearing
  something back, even from a bot—you can finally move on.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-early-users-are-saying"><strong>What early
  users are saying</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While many Product Hunt commenters have been positive—one even saying “it does
  more than it says”—some <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/reddit/">Reddit</a>
  users need more convincing.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>One user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/idiocracy/comments/1kjorru/this_is_absolutely_ridiculous/">posted</a>
  a screenshot of the Closure ad on the r/idiocracy subreddit, calling it “absolutely
  ridiculous.”</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Others in the comments seemed to agree with that sentiment.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“And now we''re officially in a <em>Black Mirror</em> episode,” said one user. </p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“Chatting with an AI version of your ex does not seem like ‘letting it go,’”
  wrote another.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“This is unhealthy and wrong in so many ways,” offered a third.&nbsp;</p>
