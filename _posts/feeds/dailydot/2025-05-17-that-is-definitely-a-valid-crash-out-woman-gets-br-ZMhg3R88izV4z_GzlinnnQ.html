  <p>If you own a car, chances are high that you will, at one point or another, need
  to get it repaired.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>While this feels like it should be a painless, easy process, it often is not.
  Car owners have reported being asked to pay hefty sums for <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/honda-driver-breaks-key-175-dollar-replacement/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">minor repairs</a>, and in some cases,
  drivers have claimed that repair shops <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/discount-tire-chevy-falls-off/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">made the problem worse</a> instead of
  just fixing the vehicle.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>But if one’s car repair is completed as expected, they generally hope that such
  repairs will be valid and usable for a considerable amount of time. However, this
  too is not always the case, as TikTok user Abi Caswell (@abicaswell) recently learned
  in a video with over 385,000 views.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:heading --></p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-went-wrong-with-this-windshield-repair"><strong>What
  went wrong with this windshield repair?</strong></h2>

  <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>In her video, Caswell shows herself laughing in a panicked manner. As the video
  continues, she reveals that her windshield has received a minor crack in its top
  left corner.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“good thing I got a brand new windshield this morning!!!!!!!!” she writes in
  the text overlaying the video. In the comments section, she clarifies that the break
  occurred on her new windshield.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>“is this a valid crash out, yes or no?” she asks in the caption.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>For context, getting one’s windshield replaced in the United States <a href="https://www.nuvisionautoglass.com/guide/how-much-does-it-cost-to-replace-a-windshield/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">usually costs</a> between $300 and $600
  for a basic windshield, though more advanced windshields or windshields for luxury
  vehicles can easily run <a href="https://autoglassservice.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-replace-a-windshield-without-insurance/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">over $1,000</a>.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>That said, windshield damage as a result of falling debris is <a href="https://www.progressive.com/answers/windshield-damage/"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">generally covered</a> by comprehensive
  auto insurance, meaning that those with such coverage are unlikely to pay a significant
  amount out-of-pocket.</p>

  <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

  <p>Additionally, some windshields, or windshield repairs, may <a href="https://only1autoglass.com/Blog/entryid/1334/understanding-auto-glass-repair-warranties-what-you-need-to-know"
  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">come with a warranty</a>. If one does
  not have insurance or does not wish to resolve the problem through insurance, they
  should simply return to the repair shop that previously did their windshield repair
  and see what can be done about it. </p>

  <p>In the comments section, users affirmed that Caswell’s crash out was, indeed,
  valid, and many others offered their own stories of repairs that quickly went awry.</p>

  <p>“100% valid crashout. It’d be nice if windshields could not shatter whenever

  <p>“This is why i refuse to get a new windshield until my cracks won’t let me get
